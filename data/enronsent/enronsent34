Darrell,

	I know you're very busy but Ranelle is the new Pricing Desk person and needs info on the southend of the pipe.  I was wondering if you could give her a call and get her up to speed on the area.  Sorry, but you're the best guy for the job.

Craig                    Ranelle 8287-7063 in Omaha
HELP!!!  I really need an explanation of how TW, NNG, and El Paso fit together in the South End.  I am so lost.  Do you have any time to just talk to me about a couple of points?  I know you are busy right now, so when you do have a free moment.  Or, is it better if I call Vernon?
Ranelle

 

At the moment the plant is down waiting for delivery of parts to repair
steam valves.  Parts may arrive this afternoon but there is no guarantee.
BVZ have no schedule for startup and therefore no gas has been nominated
for the weekend.

When the plant is ready to start up, operation will be based on gas
availability at the time.

All units should be capable of operating.  Expect to be able to get to base
load approximately 24 hours after startup.

This is fyi.  We need to be more careful on this point and refer to the schedule they send us.  Please if you have any questions call.

DS

We did manage to avoid a complete plant outage, but the loss of gas
pressure yesterday morning was still a major upset.
CT #1 did trip off and then subsequently it took several hours of
struggling to get back to where we needed to be.  We didn't get back to
peak load until 2:00 PM in the afternoon.

I'll send you data on gas usage for yesterday by separate E-Mail for your
information.
Your assistance to get all the facts related to this event will be much
appreciated so we can learn how to not go there again.

                    "Schoolcraft,
We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that
during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.

Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control
so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.
If you have any more questions please call.

Thanks DS  713-853-4299

I will be attending.

Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

Gas controllers on duty were Gayle Henley and Bart Mondon.  They both did a great job.

Thanks DS

On Tuesday we ran a PII smart pig in section 8 (Station 8 to Station 7) and on Thursday ran the smart pig in section 7 (Station 7 to Station 6).  Both runs appear to be successful.  The data will be forwarded to PII in Houston and a preliminary report will be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.  The final report will take 3 months.  
I would like to thank The teams from Montainair, Roswell and Laguna, the support help from teams Panhandle and Flagstaff, the Albuquerque Corrosion Specialist, and the Roswell Construction & Engineering group for their dedicated efforts to see the project completed.  Long days and short nights don't seem as bad when you've performed well and accomplished the goal.
I would also like to give special thanks to Darrell and the gas controllers for creating the right gas flows for a constant smooth run when the demand in California wasn't there for the gas.  You did an excellent job!
Have a great week-end.

Gas Day September 23, 2001
Gallup Compressor Station will be doing run testing.  Capacity for San Juan will stay at 
800,000 mmbtu/d.

Gas Day September 24, 2001
Gallup Compressor Station at full load.  Capacity for San Juan will increase to 850,000 
mmbtu/d. and Mainline Thoreau West System will increase from 1010,000 to 
1090,000 mmbtu/d.

Posted to the Transwestern Web Site to the customers Sunday Morning September 23, 2001

Notes:
1)  After testing is completed for the day, we are showing Both Units
Chilled but Unfired at a base condition of 463 MW.
DETM can schedule more or less than the 463 MW in Real Time, depending on
the market and gas control agreement.
2) OK to shut off one CT rather than operate both at reduced load.

Changes to Schedule Today:

1) Delayed startup after 4 hour shutdown by 1 hour.
2) Reduced MW for first hour after startup from 150 to 125.
3) Extended operation with Duct Burners at 100% firing for 3 additional
hours.

All else remains the same.

A couple of fyi items:

SoCal's balance was 151,133 mmbtus at 8/31/01.  Their balance is 300,521 mmbtus at 9/23/01.

We have received 33,130 mmbtus in payback from Williams through the 23rd which has decreased their balance to 242,260 mmbtus.

PG&E Topock's balance is 69,727 mmbtus due TW as of 9/23/01.

The index has decrease by about eighty cents during September which will cause a loss on volumetric oba's.

this happens.

Randy:  I'm the one for PHFFU issues, and I'll let Dennis volunteer someone for Facility Planning.  The general PHFFU rule is:  if you need it, call Darrell.  We can do the accounting (PHFFU to in-service) after-the-fact if you need to run it.  Call or write any time.  Steve

Randy
Our thruput this week at P-3 has been 200mmcf/day. We are running #5 and we have 2,3 and 4 shut down.  #5 is able to move 200mm, but if we lose #5 for whatever reason, 2,3, and 4 together would not be able to make the 200mm order.
P-2 cannot help us with suction pressure because of the pressure restrictions on the 24" at Canyon, and #1 is in PHFFU and I'm told needs a Major OH if we did take it out of PHFFU.  
If the 200mm orders continue we may need to take #1 out of PHFFU and have it repaired.

New Transwestern Commercial account distributions...

Just in case you receive a call from either JB or David.  They were called yesterday and I spoke with Neal and let them
know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and Monday.  
They were short for Wednesday's gas day.  My conversation was with Neal that they make adjustments to their nominated 
volumes or turn on more gas.  It does not appear they did either one.  I will call them this morning and let them know that 
they have until ID-1 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or TW will be cutting their market for ID-1.  Maybe this is a 
good opportunity to discuss park and ride again.  TW covered 7,000 mmbtu/d of Markets according to the scada numbers
that we see.

Let me know if you agree.

All,
This is what we will be looking for on Saturday.
Matt,
I ordered the BNC adapters for the Entronic cards yesterday.

Thanks, Korey   

Right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be.  If we don't have 
the volumes we can't do it.
The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to 
run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should
have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.  

Thanks DS

fyi - Also we have scheduled an emission test on #5 Trubine at P3, so it is critical we keep the station on line thru Monday.
Thanks and have a good weekend.

 Dear (INSERT NAME HERE)
I have a small favor to ask. I have friends who are camping their way
around the States and Canada. They have asked me if I know where they
might be able to go without spending large amounts of money. I said I
would
try my friends and family for accommodations.  They travel light and
bring all
their own camping gear, and only require a small place to set up. I have
already given them your name and address anyway in anticipation that you
won't mind. I have enclosed a picture to help identify them if they turn
up. They may bring the green Mercedes or the white one - sometimes they use
both.
Thanks in advance.

Rich / Rick,

Operations & the Gas Controllers didn't know about this till yesterday, when alarms started to appear in Houston.
I'm not sure what is expected from operations. In the last paragraph of Gary's letter, he indicates shutting down
for 30 minutes, 7 times a month. Is that what he is saying? Let us know what you find out.

Thanks,
Korey

We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
"Adhoc" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in ".CC" and the Analogs end
in ".SC".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.

Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =
Normal, 1 = Alarm 		(utility is off-line or error in the
data)
GALP.1903.CC 	Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Peak 		(a power peak is currently in progress)

GALP.7901.SC	Probability % Today is Peak (CLC)     HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that today is likely to be a power
peak day.
GALP.7902.SC  Probability % Now is Peak (CLC)       HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that a power peak is active now.

no.  Let me try and catch up with Rich.'

Darrell - Did you ever find out what we have on the Atoka points regarding sulfur monitor?

Lorraine after looking over what volumes we'll be receiving we'll be needing a total sulphur instrument at this location. I understand NGPL has one at the Indian Basin Plant which is an Old Barton Recorder type. These type of instruments will not pick up all the sulphur we're experiencing out of the field in that area. We have instruments that will pick up butyl sulphur along with many others that most other companies equipment can't read at this time. We're also experiencing large amounts of butyl which is a major problem for us in the Atoka field. By receiving this into our system we're having to batch or inject corrosion inhibitor's in our pipelines for protection. This is a cost to operations that we need to get a handle on. Thanks for your help in this matter
RJ
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 
Rich Jolly
10/02/2001 11:07 AM
Perry I agree with Arnie and the team. In order to keep our pipelines in good shape we need to know what we are receiving, especially from these larger delivery points. It seems like every time we agree to something different than what we require operations has to go back to marketing for dollars or put in equipment to correct the situation. We're trying to cover all bases up front so this doesn't happen in the future.
Thanks
RJ

   

Perry,
The Artesia Team and I still have concerns about having no total sulfur monitor at the location.  We are already taking gas that has high total sulfur at Atoka 2.  Since we have started using sulfur instruments that pick up Butyl Sulfur, we are almost always over .75 grains at Atoka 2 into the West Texas lateral.  The instruments that NGPL uses at the Indian Basin plant may not see Butyl Sulfurs.  If this it the case, we may have the same problem that we have at Atoka 2.  If we don't have enough other inputs to blend the gas, this can become a quality problem for deliveries at other locations. 
Since this is a 50mmcfd input to our system, I sure think we need the protection.
Thanks,  Arnie

Laura & Earl:

Planning and Gas Control can accept control valve operation by NGPL, which is included in the current drawings.  The installation of 2 control would give us problems with them fighting each other.  We have an OBA with NGPL, and we will monitor their future compliance to volume requirements.   We might have to address in this in the future if the fail to comply, but for now we're okay.

NGPL has basically the same tariff as TW and they feel protected from total sulfur at the tailgate of the Indian Basin Plant.  The Delmar H2S at the NGPL/TW point  will protect us both from H2S.  We may want to grab a sample from the IB plant to baseline the current sulfur content and verify accuracy.  Darrell and myself are comfortable with the current plans, to not install total sulfur at our interconnect with NGPl.  The cost of this new instrument is around $40,000 and I don't believe either company has plans to replace,  NGPL total sulfur instrument.

Arnie and Terry, please review and let us know if Operations can comply with our findings.  I am sure this can be resolve to our mutual agreement.

This is what Ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss.

Below is Griffith plant gas consumption data for yesterday 9/3/01.
You can see that from the time of loss of gas pressure, HE 8:00, we did not
recover until HE 14:00.
This of course extended our test schedule which required even more gas for
the day.

Note: Duct Burner #2 instrumentation is defective, otherwise the data is
OK.

We have been under burning at the Great Lakes - Carlton Interconnect for the past few days.   Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning.    The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon.

I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration.

Ron from NNG Gas Control called around 7:00 pm.m informing me that ElPaso has a turbine down creating high pressure, NNG can't deliver the gas at Waha. I confirmed the gas to 0 for the next cycle (eve cycle) in ElPaso. but did not cut any for gas day 10/8/01. The gas for tomorrow is sourcing from Altura so please contact them in the A.M. and let them know the shipper was cut ot zero. Gas Control was able to deliver gas yesterday because the pressure wasn't as high as it is now. Evidently this outage started on the 7th and is scheduled to last through the 12th. NNG probably shouldn't allow nominations at Waha until the outage is completed. 
NGTS contract 107848 was the only Shipper nominated for tomorrows gas day. EPNG will try to get the pressure down to allow us to flow to them, but won't know that until later, or tomorrow. 
(Reliant has a nom on NNG side, but not in ElPaso' system)

Also, Darrell (the allocatin' dude) decided to allocate Linam Ranch (ID2 cycle) down to 100,000 because they were not making rate since last Friday. In cutting the Linam Ranch Point the Hobbs system Group was not allocated on the ID2 cycle. 

so far my first night back has been rather exicting!!

 

There is volume flowing to the plant.  The team is trying to get the Scada back in service.  Will keep you updated.

Thanks DS

looks that way but Darrell is inquiring to double check - there is a possibility that the volumes are not coming into SCADA - 
Darrell will let us know 

There continues to be a need for volumes scheduled as a delivery because this feeds a receipt to California.  As of 10/9, contract #26813 has deliveries of 28,098 and contract #27583 has receipts of 8,709.  Are you also telling me that North Star Steel is not burning anything?!?

Why is there currently a nom for delivery to North Star Steele.  It doesn't look like they have taken gas from us in a while since 10/1

or have they???

Jason:
As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows:
	The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February.
	The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.

	The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  

The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  

I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705

I think you have done a great job on the article.  I know the Weather Group will appreciate the comments.  I did make a few changes and saved them as the same document with a "_Schwieger" behind it.  I have no pride of ownership and Im not a writer so do with it as you see fit!

OK, here's an initial draft of your Enron Business article.  Please review and return your comments to me as soon as possible.  The deadline for changes is noon on Wednesday.

Mike: please be sure that everyone quoted has a chance to review their quote.  Also, one more question: who is the female in the photo shoot -- you just told me there were no female meteorologists!

 

Thanks, guys, for taking the time to meet with me.  I enjoyed writing this one.

Warm regards,
Sarah.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th=
at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a=
nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem=
ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el=
se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior=
 Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati=
on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a=
s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten=
ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v=
alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som=
ething just the opposite.

I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n=
ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha=
ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in=
 the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t=
he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue"  implies to me that this ind=
ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa=
inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga=
me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen=
t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua=
ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn=
ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini=
tion of the word "HEDGE".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an=
d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski=
ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En=
ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?

I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=
n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=
d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I=
 will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the=
 Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say=
 " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=
nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =
their word?

The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=
ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =
took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=
ion is "CRIMINAL".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=
etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals=
 have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne=
ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h=
aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders =
have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we=
re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther =
down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve=
d and to institute criminal charges.  =20

I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not =
think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we=
 trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th=
orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what=
 actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor=
mance to date.=20

Pretty neat!

Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information:
	1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future?					
	2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.

Are you ready for the visitors this weekend?
Hope the weather is great!

Looks like tonight will be really stormy.
Flash flood warning is in place.
Sounds like things should clear up and be beautiful by noon on Saturday.
Jarrod's birthday is Monday so we are planning on taking 3-4 kids with us to the lake house.

Have a good day.
Talk with you this weekend.

This "e mail" is to confirm receipt of my WorldCom Card

Looks OK to me!

Attached hereto is a revised draft of the letter to AEP that will accompany Jim's schedules.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks
 << File: Settlement letter to AEP.doc >> 

Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

Linda called and said that they do not have enough vacation days left in 2001, so they would like to use one of the later packages in 2002.
They asked how late in 2002 they could possibly go and I said I would have to ask you what's available.
Give me a call when you get a chance.
This is what I could not remember the other day when we talked.

I'm in a really sour mood.
I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time!
I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
It's the "pits"
I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.
I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things.
My excuse is that I'm always exhausted
I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this.
I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!
 
ENE is down $1.42 right now!

Hi Jim.  
 
We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and
a Chrysler Town & Country. 

Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers
the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns
16. Ha! : ) 

We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has
many "bells and whistles" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.

We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the
Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The
Toyota dealer also has "$300 over invoice" sale on currently. Plus they told
Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can
choose from. 

So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
What do you think?
 
Love,
Linda
 
PS  We got a pkg. in the mail today from you.  Thanks!!  I will wait until the kids are here to open it.

Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me!
I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess.
It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly. 
I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?

How about you and Mike?  
I hope all is well!  If there is anything I can do please let me know?

`	Jim, hope all is ok with you.  I have been keeping touch with Joan and this whole situation is unbelievable.  I guess I am still in shock about it all.

Jeff:

Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.  It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.  Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.  If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.  I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.

	Thanks, Jim 

Vin:

The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know!
Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years.
Cash Balance Plan would not allow me access today!  I think it is around $35,000.  I believe Pat should have a copy of my last statement (June 30, 2001)

I hope this is what you were looking for?
	Jim Schwieger

Jeff:
I finally received the replacement pages for the Centana Stg Contract.  The Storage Contract and Firm & Interruptible Transport Contracts should be delivered to you sometime today.  Please review and initial if everything is OK.  Can I just sign after your approval or do I need to obtain someone else's approval?  Please let me know.

I need this information ASAP - not only for while you are out, but also for purposes pertaining to our big move to the new building, which (by the way) is next Friday, November 9th.  WOO HOO!  I'll be sending more information to you soon about the move.

Thanks,

Whatever you all decide is fine with me!

Get what you want.  Just le me know Style, color, special equipment etc.
 
    Love Jim

Hi Jim
 
Hope work is going ok with all the changes taking place there.
 
Just wanted to let you know we have been looking at cars.  
 
We asked the kids what they thought.  They really like the SUV's. 
 
I think another mini-van would be great as far as room to move around as well as having 7 places to sit, but the kids are a little more interested in what looks "cool".         : )
 
There are a couple midsize suv's that now have a third seat (although the seat it is closer to the ground).  That might be a good compromise.(?)
 
Anyway, it sure is FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to look.  
 
Thanks for being there for us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Let me know if you have any thoughts on the process.
 
Love and Hugs
 
Linda

Thanks,

I have scheduled the Health Center to come and administer flu shots to our floor on Wednesday.  I need to have an approximate number of how many vaccines we will need.  Please ask within your groups today and see who will be interested and let me know.

Thank You,

Hope you have a fun night celebrating your ah? 28 birthday, right?
Call when you figure out what's good for you.  Wednesday looks best for me right now.

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?

Denae
Please join us to celebrate the birthdays of Helen and Denae (no they are
not twins) on Tuesday Nov. 6th at The Front Porch on W. Gray.  Tuesdays are
Steak Night at The Front Porch in case you get the munchies.  The
festivities will begin between 6:30 and 7:00.

Please rsvp via email if you can attend this fabulous event.  Hope to see
you there!

If I already sent this to you just ignore this!
I will need a new chair for the new building!
The one I have now does not cut it.
Please order one like I have now!

	Thanks, Jim

ONE MORE THING:

Please let everyone know that the tag is for their chair to move over.  We are not getting new chairs after all.  
Also, tell them to please leave their pink bag on their desk the day of the move.

Thanks

Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!

I think he will be talking with you!

Do I need to do something more with Eric?  I talked to him the other day, trying to reassure him that Lavo realizes the value that he brings to the organization and that he will be taken care of.

Tom

I think the industry needs to look at Enron credit rating like a male looks at a women's Bra size.
A triple B is actually better than a triple A
What do you think?

i'm not so sure that i will put anymore into ENE.....just depends on how low it goes!

We go to Dallas this weekend.
We may have a couple hour layover in Houston on Sunday evening so may have to have you come visit after the baseball party.

I'm making an except by responding to your e-mail.......it is usually my policy not to respond to such things!!! hahahaha

Hi There!

I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
I went to New Orleans last weekend.
It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
It was a nice feeling!

Are we still on for Wednesday night?
It still works for me!

I hope all is well!

Thanks !  I knew it was short notice.

Next Wednesday sounds good to me - let's plan on it.
What do you think of all this Enron stuff ?

Happy Birthday!

I have a dentist appt out by the house at 4:00 pm so I will have to opt for dinner next week!
Hope you have a fun night celebrating your ah? 28 birthday, right?
Call when you figure out what's good for you.  Wednesday looks best for me right now.

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?

Denae
Please join us to celebrate the birthdays of Helen and Denae (no they are
not twins) on Tuesday Nov. 6th at The Front Porch on W. Gray.  Tuesdays are
Steak Night at The Front Porch in case you get the munchies.  The
festivities will begin between 6:30 and 7:00.

Please rsvp via email if you can attend this fabulous event.  Hope to see
you there!

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

SPECIFICATION  10

Jim, I know I asked you a similar or maybe even the samequestion a few weeks ago but I really believe that the question was limited to ERCOT and we therefore determined that other than Bammel , Enron had no storage in ERCOT......I do recall that you mentioned 2 places where we had capacity...but that were not in ERCOT...I do believe they are in TEXAS and the question now is Enron's storage capacity in all of TEXAS.  

I need this information Urgently.................PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

MANY Thanks

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest"

Jim,

Do you remember Rob Lloyd?  He know works at AIM Funds here in town.  Please read the piece below - I think it is well written and summarizes our sad situation succinctly.

Regards, Jean
Jean, 

Thought you'd find this interesting.  It's an excerpt from an analyst's note
out this AM.

A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:
It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,
but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.

The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various
off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently
became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,
their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into
something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began
30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)
sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They
involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value
(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This
allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.

If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very
New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,
to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the
latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the
table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM
partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.
Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed
muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized
in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had
used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these
were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

Sorry, I missed your call.
I was to busy being sarcastic about ENE!

How about 6:00 PM.
I can go for a run beforehand.
I picked the time so you have to pick the place.

Yes - what time ?

Hi There!

I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
I went to New Orleans last weekend.
It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
It was a nice feeling!

Are we still on for Wednesday night?
It still works for me!

I hope all is well!

Thanks !  I knew it was short notice.
The big ol 35 -- but you can say 28.
Next Wednesday sounds good to me - let's plan on it.
What do you think of all this Enron stuff ?

Happy Birthday!

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"  
"Sure," said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, "Now go out and play."  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from s=
omeone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a met=
hod that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is tha=
t the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from sto=
rage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percent=
age was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.=
  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the=
 Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would =
try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures=
 for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refill=
ing, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining invento=
ry.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu fa=
ctor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected =
as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints =
This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increase=

Hi Jim,=20

I'm still working on the modelling of the Kathleen Ann storage and one of t=
he issues I need to account for is mmbtu enhancement. How would you suggest=
 I account for this? Currently, to get the the intrinsic storage value, I t=
ake the max working gas capacity times the may/jun - dec spread over the cu=
rve. One idea is to just take the incremental mmbtus times the spread as we=
ll -- although this wouldn't account for the physical capacity contraints, =
it would put a value on the enhancement.

Thanks,

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

If the MMBtu enhancement is this high, have we considered whether this liquid content would be to high for the pipelines to accept (exceed pipeline spec's).  Will additional facilities be needed to reduce the liquid content?

Garry,

As part of the KAF modelling, I would like to account for the mmbtu enhancement. However, I would like your input as to what the most appropriate number to use. Currently--as per Brian Redmond--we have a 110% enhancement (I think this is the number that the GLO folks threw out at the meeting we attended). Is this in the ballpark? 

Thanks and best regards,

Chris

Thought  you might enjoy!  How was your day?  ENE just cant seem to stay up.  Two down days in a row!  I have Jarrod tonight since Joan & Dave are out of town.  Might try and go play poker if Josh will watch Jarrod for me.  

Have a good evening!

FOR YOUR INFORMATION

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

I think Greg Whalley and John Lavorato are individuals we can trust.  I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

Thanks for this tidbit - I would be extremely upset if Fastow were allowed one more lousy red cent!!!!  When will the raping of the employees by Management stop!!!!

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 

'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Lay said. "The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence." 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

"These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully," he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

"Everything we know, you now know," Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What religion do you think we are?"  
The oldest one said, "We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you."  
The littlest one said, "Didn't you smell that water?"  
"Yes. What do you think that means?"  
"That means we're Pisscopalians"

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss=

of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=

Dear Monique,

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have improved from what you have to the following:
	Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
	Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
	Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d
Call 713-853-7705 if you have questions.

Nick & Brad:

What is the status of the MidCon Flagstaff Meter Station?  As contemplated HPL is having a difficult time delivering Entex volumes into MidCon during the cold weather Houston has been experiencing.  Given changes in MidCon's system this situation will probably continue to be a challenge throughout the winter.  This problem is compounded by the start up of the Nov. - Feb. deliveries to MidCon of 83,334 MMBtu/d.  All of our eggs seem to be collecting in the Flagstaff Meter Station so its imperative that this station be operational ASAP.  Please provide me with an update!

No working gas available to sell to the winning bidder, but we will probably have some Cushion Gas that we will have to pay back!
	Swig
Jim 
Just to clarify, the quesiton is will there be any working gas available for sale to the winning bidder as of the end of January.

Jim Schwieger
10/02/2000 03:55 PM
Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

	Swig

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.

09/25/2000 09:13 AM
Brad:
Right now we have to assume that we will be withdrawing Nov. 2000 through March, 2001 with a goal of emptying the facility down to 60 BCF.  This will require the injection of approximately 55 BCF of gas from April 1, 2001 through October 31, 2001.  Available run time should be no lower than 98%.  Why would it be greater?
The rest will have to be answered by someone else.

	Swig

Hanover Compression has given me a revised fuel consumption number of 7150 BTU/horsepower-hr for the KVSRs once they have been converted to Clean Burn technology.  This compares to the present 7500 BTU/horsepower-hr.  We need to come to a consensus on the assumptions that will be used with this figure.  These assumptions will need to be as follows:

How many hours a year do we really think that these units will run?  I am assuming that they will not be running if Bammel is on withdrawal.  Correct or not?
How much horsepower will really run?  This will be determined by how much market HPL will hope to capture from ANP and possibly Equistar.  It will also be affected by the suction pressure of the gas, which is, in turn, determined by how much HPL is injecting and pressures at Katy.
Finally, what available run time do we want to assume here?  90%?

I have no preconceived notions of what these assumptions should be; therefore, I am soliciting input from each of you.  We need to be in agreement before Emma starts her work.  Thank you.

These volumes equal to scheduled injections and withdrawals.  The only month that had a variance was January 2000.  We charged Texas for injections of 2,174,530 mmbtu and the actual injections were  1,242,074 mmbtu.

The attached schedule is my projection of Bammel Injection activity through the remainder of 2000.  This is an estimate as of today March 5, and will change as the futures curve changes.  The schedule also includes a Fuel Percentage Table that I would recommend using in the future to determine the fuel percentage to be utilized at different Gas In Place levels.  

It is my understanding that all Electric Compressor Cost will be charged to a separate location each month and the Storage Book will credit that location with the calculated gas compressor costs on a monthly basis.   Please let me know if this is your understanding and if the Fuel Percentage Table recommended above is OK with you!

Attached are the revised agreements based on our discussion prior.  Please review and if everything  looks good, I will prepare executables for MidCon.
Please note the following revisions:

	1.  Midcon installs, owns, and operates the Deer Park Interconnect.	
	2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
	3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
	4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.

  

Please call if you have any questions.  x-33512.

Kevin agrees with leaving the language in the agreement's.
I'm comfortable with the language.  I will get it pushed through on this
side.  Let's get it done.

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both
interconnects
to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language
requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances
constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this
way
both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and
delivery
interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.

I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed at the meeting previously.  

Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 

Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Have you reached an agreement within your shop about the location of the
second

I thought ENE would be down for sure today?
Everyone was talking about it here before the market opened.
I guess the Market is just happy we told the truth?  Or they thought it was more?

I feel pretty good but I had time to adjust yesterday afternoon.
Got taxes done for everyone.

Baseball game tonight at 8:00

Why are you out of the office on Tuesday?

Be Good!

	Swig

I'm really really tired this morning!
We got home at 10, but i didn't sleep very well.
I get a massage this evening. That will be nice!

ENE isn't down like I thought it would be!!

Hope all is well.
Have a great day!

Mike

Called the number you gave me about 7:40 PM but it was your pager not your cell phone. (713-415-4571)
I figured you were pretty tired and just sleeping, which was the best thing for you anyway.
I went over to the Kinder Morgan party.  

You missed a great weekend.
Saturday was a little cool up at the lake, but Sunday was fantastic.

I hope you feel better before your trip to the spa.
Don't work so much!

I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.
	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 
	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.
			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L
	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION
	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION
	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION
	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.
			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.
			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)
		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  

Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.

	Thanks,  Jim

Thanks for the way you wrote this letter!  It gets to the point, yet does not imply anything other than a search for an explanation.

If measurement is correct, this will cause the texas desk to inject 235,182 mmbtu's more in March than they expected.  Is there any way we can come up with a better explanation than the field estimates were wrong?  We need to assure commercial that the cause for the discrepancy is explanable and correctable.
Let me know if the cause for the incorrect field estimates can be determined.
Thanks,
Kenny

   

As you know, Commercial's expectations are derived from estimates.  I have rechecked the data with Measurement and it has been determined that the EFM data is correct and no adjustments will be made.  It is believed the estimates were entered wrong from the field.

 
Kenny J Soignet
04/26/2001 09:41 AM
It seems the variance between commercial's expectation and measurement has not been resolved.  Please let me know what caused this variance.  The variance needs to be resolved ASAP since accounting has to close its books for March.
Thanks,
Kenny
 
Kenny J Soignet
04/06/2001 02:32 PM
Check it out.  This is a very high variance.  I will need an explanation before I tell commercial.
Thanks,
Kenny

   

Earl, here is the schedule.

 

Kenny, there is a variance of 178,259 this month.  Earl will review the schedule to verify my info.  Please let me know if I need to do anything to bring this variance down.  Thanks

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.
   

AGA for 5/4/01 is 108
   

This assumes 65 bcf or approximately 67 tbtu of pad gas.  According to this mornings Operations Reprt there is 88.3 bcf in the cavern.  This includes Third Party Storage volumes of approximately 3.4 tbtu.  Let me know if this is not what you werer asking.

	Jim

Jim,  Does this assume 60 or 65 bcf of pad gas?  What is the total volume in the cavern?

Brian

Thanks Jim S.

I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them this week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update them of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our trading position.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.

Yes, all withdrawals for Centana should be in the same month (May).  If we don't have a deal ticket for the additional April injections Kenny please prepare one for my signature.

	Thanks,  Jim
Kenny J Soignet
04/04/2001 03:55 PM
Your deals are correct.  We need to write a new deal ticket for March 2001 since we injected an additonal 21,640 mmbtus.  The total was 193,050 according to scheduling.  We need to find out if Tom wants us book the withdrawal of this additional gas in May like the rest of the withdrawals.  We are still injecting in April.  We also need to find out if he wants us to write another assumption for April's injections.

   

I have a different # for Spindletop.  I have two deals.  One at 26590 mmbtus and the other at -198000 for a total of 171410 injection.  Is the 26590 fuel?  They are on the same ticket.

Dave

Kenny J Soignet
04/02/2001 03:24 PM
Please send me the detail for March storage assumptions.  The assumptions should equal 7,863,146 mmbtu.  You should also have ProductionTax deals.  The Prod. Tx should net to zero.

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.  

Ted:  Please respond to Brian's question on when the Ad Val Tax is paid.  Please "cc" me on your answer also.

	Thanks,  Jim

When is this tax due?  If it is paid at the end of the year - it is 100% for the account of AEP.

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

is brand new and never been used.  It's a great buy if you like action
adventures games.  I think your kids will like it.  Also 4 players can play
at the same time.  It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret
doors.  We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League
City, TX is going to get one.  Also would you want us to set them on free
play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.  It's your
choice.  It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg

Let me know if you have made any decisions

Thanks,

Hi guys:

I want you both to know that you should be totally embarrassed that the 48 year old fat guy found the web site on his own when you two could not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The web site is:  www.boat-ed.com/tx/
Ben get on it right away so that you can ride the wave runners by yourself!
Its going to be fun.
Congratulations on passing all of your classes.  

See you in a couple of weeks!

	Swig

Hello.

Good news!  Ben passed all of his classes...by the skin of his teeth, so he
is able to come to Houston.  :)

Ben and I both tried to find the web site about the wave runner license but
were unsuccessful.  Were you able to ask your friends?  Ben is now very
anxious to take the test so he can drive one of the wave runners.

Love,
Linda

Thanks!

Just a reminder, Josh has an appointment for Wednesday @ 3:30 for a filling at Pediatric Dental Sp.

How are you today?
Things are OK down here!
Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

They continue to hate ENE!
It really makes me wonder?

Be Safe!
Swig

How are you today?
The ball game last night was a disaster!
We give the "Bad News Bears" a bad name.
Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3

On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.
I will let you know what comes of things.

Why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil.  I hate all of this shit!  It hurts!

	Love Jim

You have to listen to this one very funny -- It's clean (no really it is)
For those of you who are using 1972 computers and don't have speakers 
attached or built in then you lose.

I slept good also!
Today is supposed to be close to 90, but then the front moves through and Thursday is supposed to be 74
I would like to do the half marathon with you but unless I have allot more free time I don not think I can get into a shape that I could run that far! 
I'm really fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm getting pressure or inferences that if I do not drop things my bonus might not be there!
Saying things like it would be a shame to have such a good year and then have it blown in the fourth quarter!
They really do not know that such comments just makes me more committed and perhaps with a vengeance!
It does get me down because I'm not sure mankind is worth it!
If people you thought had standards, ethics and morals are now applying pressure, whets the use?

Sorry, to be complaining!
Talk to you later!

Swig

How are you this morning?
I slept really well last night.
Just trying to get some contracts written and signed up here.
It's cooler today and still very very windy. Only supposed to be 50 today, but back to 70 this weekend.

I see that houston is now offering a half marathon.......are you interested?
I wouldn't mind doing that and Andy with Pennaco said he wouldn't mind running it either.

Hope all is well.

Have a great day!!

Mike

Thanks,  Boy I'm disappointed in the questions asked by other employee's!
Maybe the Employees deserve what they get?

Sounds like Parris was quick but fun.
Glad it was you and not me on the plane for 17 hours.

Be good and stay safe
	Swig

Good question...it is a shame he did not answer it!  I am sure it will be answered in one of the many investor lawsuits that are springing up.

Sorry about not returning your call this morning!
I was trying to finish my questions for the All Employee meeting!  
Like it made any difference!
They would not address any of my questions.
What made it worst is I can not believe how STUPID the general Enron employee population is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the midst of the worst company crisis ever, when they have a chance to ask important questions, they ask the stupidest most irrelevant questions in the history of mankind!
I have concluded that the Employees deserve what they have gotten!!!
I'm not sick just lost my faith in everyone!  Except you of course!

lets talk tonight.
Jarrod has a 6:00 pm ball game, but I do not think we are going!

Thanks, for calling!
	Swig

How are you this morning?
Are you listening to the investor conference call?
Are you going to the employee meeting?

You need to let me know when you have regular scheduled meetings so i'm not calling at those times.
When does nymex open and close?

I could tell you were in a meeting when i called this morning. It also sounded like you are sick. Are you???

Not too much going on up here, just the usual pissed off customers yelling at me!

Hope all is well.

Mike

I really wish you would not feel that way or make an apology.  I do not consider what you expressed Friday night was anything other than honesty and true emotion and I would like to feel comfortable expressing those same feelings to you!  I trust you and respect your opinion to great extent because of the above.  If I can help its yours!

	Smile and take a deep breath!
	I believe their is a reason for everything!
	Let me know if their is anything you want me to express at the "All Employee Mtg"

		Swig

Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.

Here it is.

I'm forwarding the attached as an update.  Am presently researching the issue 
raised by Drew, and will let you know what I find.
	
	

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to TriState Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  FERC got all over CMS 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  CMS tried to do something that sounds a lot like what PNM would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

	
	

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Texas Eastern criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about PNM's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Hinshaw.  This deal would seem to blow their Hinshaw exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Hinshaw for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving CMS.  Does PNM know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Hinshaw issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Mary Kay Miller
03/11/2000 11:22 AM
Mary,  I was unable to forward the attachment--  so try to get it form Glen
Susan,  I don't think it is a problem to try this, however,  do we have the 
current rates including fuel etc that we would have to pay and how much 
capacity would we be acquiring?  Need to see this-  MK

   
	
	

The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system 
between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would 
acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's 
constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Texas Eastern criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service 
Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the 
Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.

Jeff, here are Colleen's comments.  At your convenience, let's meet to 
discuss.
Colleen Raker
03/20/2000 07:37 PM
Attached is a black-lined version of my redraft of certain provisions of the 
3/03/00 draft of the above Agreement.  The purpose of my changes was to (i) 
apportion the risk assumed by TW and Calpine based on the economic benefits 
realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the 
risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced 
by TW and the list of services routinely performed.  I noticed that there is 
no insurance  coverage  required of either Party.  I expect that Calpine 
insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position 
to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand, 
third party property that is in the care, custody and control of TW while it 
performs its work, is not covered by Enron's standard general liability 
policies.  Builder's risk  coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the 
coverage is expensive.  Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning. 

If TW plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money 
collected by Customer from TW's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section 
should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further 
edited to stipulate that limitation.  If TW's limitation of liability is to 
be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives 
under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the 
latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.

Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes.

Attached for your information is a summary of other parties' requests for 
rehearing of Order 637.  I will be happy to answer any questions you might 
have.

The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into 
discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The 
standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that 
the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these 
discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were 
once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than 
a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 
agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only 
applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement 
does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the 
shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not 
guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The 
discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an 
answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have 
discussed this and he is on board. Thanks.

Jeff, here it is.  Take a look and if you have any questions, I'll be 
prepared to address them promptly so you can send this off.

The attached electronic version of Section 5.4 integrates the changes noted 
by underline on the hard copy I left in your office the other day.  I took 
this opportunity to also divide Section 5.4 into 2 subparagraphs for 
clarity's sake.  I also inserted a new  sentence at the end of subparagraph A 
which was suggested by Enron Risk Management at a meeting I had with them 
yesterday.  I will be adding this insert in the standard Limitation of 
Liabilitysection in the GPG O&M forms of agreement.  Please replace the 
currect section 5.4 in the Calpine O&M with the attached.

Gerald -- here are a couple of suggested wording changes (should appear in 
blue)

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713)

that we considered it to be confidential.

Jeffery Fawcett
03/29/2000 06:04 PM
Lindy,
I agree with Lynn -- not only for the valid reasons she articulated, but 
because I think we may have a conflict of interest here.  You see, 
Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding.  As such, we are 
currently involved (albeit indirectly) in negotiations with SoCal and other 
parties regarding the ability [and mechanism] for SoCal to recover costs to 
implement unbundled services on their system.  System pooling is one of those 
services.
  
I'll defer to counsel on this, but in my humble opinion, I don't think it 
wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on.  
First, its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give 
another party information that could prove to be prejudicial.  Secondly, and 
probably more practically, if Transwestern were of a mind to, it could 
intentionally skew the results of their survey. 

Unless collective wisdom feels differently, I'd suggest we politely decline 
on some reasonably nebulous basis, i.e. --- we don't know... we forgot.... we 
really didn't account for it separately... it's been too long.... the people 
who might have known are no longer here... whatever.   That way we don't 
appear uncooperative, just incompetent!  

I'm kidding.  Just let me know how else I can help here.

Lindy Donoho
03/29/2000 12:00 PM
Here is some input from Lynn.
Sheila and Lindy, I am not sure I am comfortable giving them any costs.  On 
timing, it varies so much between
companies based on systems, manpower, etc.   Maybe we should discuss before 
giving them anything?
Thanks. Lynn

Tammy Jaquet

03/28/2000 09:06 PM
Do you want us to proceed with gathering this data for SoCal?

Regards,

Tammy
As you may be aware, SoCalGas is going through Gas Industry Restructuring.? 
One of our settlement proposals is to provide pooling service.? We have been 
asked to compare our estimate for cost and development time with others who 
have implemented pooling service on their system.? Therefore, if you have a 
ballpark figure of the cost incurred to develop pooling and approximately how 
long it took to build from the time you provided requirements to your 
implementation date, we would appreciate it very much.? If you have any 
questions, you can e-mail me or call me at (213) 24r-3812.

Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a 
couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries 
and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get 
tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away. 

Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to 
go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he 
borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter 
than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that 
Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.  
It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and 
the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to 
move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get 
it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm 
really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not 
on a Saturday.

Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you 
doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that 
weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri. 
or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.

Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is 
having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving 
Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun 
group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see 
them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big 
drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans 
are.

Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this 
will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your 
fingers crossed!

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz--Big article about the Enron ballpark today--did the company treat
you to the opening?

I'm up to my ears in jobs around the house in preparation for Eric's visit.
It's always a good thing to have company--you get all kinds of things done
you should have done a long time ago.  I painted half of my bedroom last
night, and the other half will have to wait until I decide what to do with
the windows.  But, I needed to paint over the patch on the fireplace wall,
and the holes left by the blinds I took down ages ago.  Didn't know what
color I had used, so I chose a new one.  You can't really tell that I've
stopped at the corners.

Jim is still unsure about his business trip rescheduled and rescheduled for
next week, the 4th and 5th.  I'm hoping it's canceled because Karin asked if
I would come, and that really puts me in a bind with Eric coming in on the
6th as far as cooking, and last minute things.  Sally is coming on the 8th,
so if the trip is postponed until that week, she'll be around.

Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed?

Did I tell you I bought 4 rocking chairs for the back porch?  They're not as
comfortable as I thought they'd be.

Hope you have a good weekend.  love, mum

See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add 
Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.

Brian:  Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of 
parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the 
following footnote:  Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement 
proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary 
and secondary rights described on Appendix A.  Transwestern does not oppose 
the other parts of the settlement.

Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been 
filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that 
we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To 
that end, it's time to review some basics.

In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  "We see reason to 
pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the 
short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern 
customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about 
it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific 
proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined."

Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:

1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road 
were established as a formal receipt point
2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing 
primary and secondary receipt points
3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we 
might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that 
works)

I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief 
after testimony has been filed.

Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to 
say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.
 

Not at all!  Fawcett's the antsy one; he is anxious to use his new honorary 
law degree (ahem!).
I agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a 
settlement when the agreement has yet to be written.  It would be like giving 
SoCal a signed blank check (that's carte blancheto us lawyers), and we don't 
trust them that much.
Once we've signed a real agreement, I do want to file something in support.  
I'm just trying to plan ahead, is all.

Jeff Dasovich @ EES on 04/04/2000 04:32:07 PM
OK, you folks are getting antsy out there.  I haven't yet begun to think 
about a declaration.  And don't plan on thinking about one until 1) the 
Commission has approved the motion, and 2) Socalgas shows during the first 
week or so that it intends to faithfully put into details what it has agreed 
to in principal.  Also, if the motion is approved, the hearing likely won't 
happen on the 11th (one would hope).

Am I missing something?  Are you folks concerned about something that I'm 
missing?

Aurora, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we 
will have to do as far as containment of PCBs this year is the subject of 
some dispute.  I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible.

Susan:

AA auditor reviewed our footnotes to our browncover for TW (Section 7 - 
Litigation and Contingencies) and was asking for some information regarding 
the following paragraph:

Transwestern incurred and continues to incur certain costs related to 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that migrated into one of its customer's 
facilities through use of a PCB-based lubricant.  Because of the continued 
detection of PCBs near Transwestern's Topock station, Transwestern continues 
to take measures to contain the PCB at an estimated cost of $2.3 million in 
1998 and an estimated $5.4 million in 1999.

Here are the AA's questions:

1) Can you please provide the actual cost for 1999 and the estimated cost for 
2000

2)  Also, if you have a copy of where these costs are coming from so AA can 
tie their figures

Can you please provide this information today as AA wants to wrap up the 
notes.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.

Aurora

Do we have an estimate of PCB decontamination costs for 2000?  AA is 
asking...

Drew -- see MK's comments.  I'm trying to come up with some new language to 
address her concerns.

TRANSWESTERN CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the provided non-standard discount letter for Duke Energy 
Trading & Marketing.   Duke's 18,000 Dth/d Ignacio to Blanco contract has a 
one year term and a seasonal based 1-part rate structure.  Transportation on 
an alternate basis is provided for on a south to north flow direction at an 
incremental $.01 charge based upon actual utilization of the described path.

Please provide an indication of approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any 
questions arise, please contact me at x35702.

Here is the breakdown of 1999 PCB decontamination costs for TW:

Topock mods   $4,675,000
PG&E sample taps  $     90,000
PG&E filter separator  $   600,000
Remove PG&E filter separator $     10,000

If you need the costs broken down in more detail, or need more information, 
please give me a call at x30596.

For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people 
might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics 
of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.  The 
three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the 
PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might 
issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.  I think it is probably fair to 
expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at 
the PHC.

Jeffery Fawcett
04/07/2000 05:28 PM
I participated in a teleconference today at 3:00 p.m. with several members of 
the "all-party" settlement group.  The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea 
Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the 
deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't 
seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.

According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant 
SoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion 
during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge 
Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full 
scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer 
any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the 
Commission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be 
due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's 
ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into 
something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different 
procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).

The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner 
Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and 
ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on 
Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu 
of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby, 
similar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in 
favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge 
supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the 
settlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one 
which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on 
the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule 
whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on 
April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the 
chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations) 
indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic, 
including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before 
May 5?

As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be 
forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review, 
but not to comment on.  SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete 
version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.  

As far as Transwestern is concerned, I've spoken independently with the team 
-- Susan, Mark and Jeff Dasovich.  Each of us will review and provide TW 
comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document.  Susan will be 
representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday.  Mark Baldwin will 
be there also to support Susan's efforts on Tuesday.  Susan and Jeff (and 
maybe Mark?) will try and hook-up Tuesday morning to compare notes and talk 
about the upcoming Commission PHC.

Steve, between Susan and I, we'll continue to forward documentation and other 
materials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments 
and/or any drafts of testimony TW intends to file in this case.
 

Shelley -- I'm going to the game but should be back in the office after 5 pm 
today if you want to chat.  x30596.

Drew, I'll fax you the information on the "Be a Spokesmodel...or Just Look 
Like One" course they offer here in the Houston office.

Just checking to see if anybody has any comments for me on my draft of the 
petition for waiver, especially as to whether we just file revised procedures 
or the petition.

Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the 
surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill 
doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will 
for cheap.

Vanessa Schulte
04/11/2000 09:42 AM
Can you ask Bill if he knows anything about wills?  Dena told me that if Greg 
were to die and we didn't have a will, I would get half and his ex would get 
the other half for the kids.  Greg disagrees but this is what Dena was told 
by her lawyer if Curtis were to die.  It's not something I'd like to think 
about, and it's not like we own that much right now anyway, but when we get a 
house, that's a different story.

Thanks

FYI:  This morning, Lorraine and I checked with PNM and surprisingly they do 
not offer any kind of IT transportation service, just firm service.  So our 
final revisions to the cover letter do not include acquiring interruptible 
service from PNM, since it's impossible to do so.   

Hi there!  How's the little buglet doing?  It was good to see you last week, 
and I feel honored that I got to accompany Grayson on her first restaurant 
mission.  Hopefully the french-fry smell did not throw her off her feeding 
schedule to badly.  Got a message from Mema wanting to discuss the baby's 
bottle habits.  Pu-lease!  If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill 
at Easter as a distraction.

This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends 
(aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150.  I'll be driving someone's SUV.  
If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner 
of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home.

Do you remember Rob Carty from high school?  I just saw him at a seminar 
given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers.  He works for Exxon/Mobil now.  I 
barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!

Thought you would enjoy the following brief excerpt from today's Wall Street 
Journal:

***
Big Boy's Adventures in Thailand

With his checkered overalls, cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers, 
Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok.

"People thought he was a little, well, creepy," says Peter Smythe, the head 
franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy 
statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare.  "They kept asking me, 'Is he a 
Chinese Ronald McDonald?'"  Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy 
was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet.

I'm a man trapped in a woman's body... not really, this is Jeff Fawcett in 
Susan's office.  We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking 
about the settlement document.  Would you guys pull-up the attached file, 
"Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the 
section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"  I think we're OK here, but I don't 
want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter 
or that just doesn't make sense.

We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be 
sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.  Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note 
saying thumbs up or down?  Thanks a bunch.

I've  now added you.
?
Attached is a new version of the Gas Industry Settlement document for  
SoCalGas and SDG&E.? I think that essentially all the terms of the  
settlement in principle are now covered in it.
?
In  addition to adding material, we have made some changes in language in the 
last  version.? Even these changes may not incorporate all comments I have  
received from SoCalGas/SDG&E management.? We have NOT made an attempt  to 
respond to all comments received to date in this version.? If no change  has 
been made on an issue you commented on, that does not necessarily mean we  
agree or disagree with your comment.? 
?
Especially for the new material, there has not yet been final review by  
SoCalGas and SDG&E management either.
?
Hopefully I have been able to correct a problem with the last electronic  
version that cause a lot of the section numbering to go haywire when it was  
emailed and then opened and printed, even though it looked fine on my 
computer  and printed fine from my computer.? Lots of sections mysteriously 
would  renumber themselves as "6.4"
?
I am  also attaching the latest draft of an appendix to be included with the 
full  settlement that is a revised version of the "Primary and Secondary 
Receipt  Point Access Rights" document that was attached with the Deal Points 
in the  April 3 filing.
?
We'll  try to send along some of the other appendices soon.?

LANDMINE!  Look at the new SoCalGas language respecting the Edison/SDG&E 
contract in Section 1.9.  Whadaythink?  Write back at this address!  Are you 
going to raise the issue?

Rob,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last 
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between 
SoCalGas and Edison.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...  
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.

Jeff

pull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that 
document.  I don't necessarily think it does.  Didn't we basically agree to 
disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you 
saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of 
noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the 
VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For 
example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver 
it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?

Let's get clarification!!!

I agree 100% and I want them to state they may elect the capacity however,
it is at the current rate if you will.  This is an attempt to take us back
several weeks in my opinion.

Rob,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last

you still there?

I'm available Tuesday also -- just let me know.

Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your 
question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community 
property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any 
case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and 
save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe 
his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be 
competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're 
doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise 
calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the 
best deal.  If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.  Hope 
this helps!

Glen, I'm faxing you Transwestern's signature page and declaration.  An 
electronic version of the declaration is attached.

Glen:  I think this will be fine.  Please add the word "Company" after

See the attached.  The proceeding certainly isn't over, but I think the 
parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the Commission 
will eventually approve, provided the parties present sufficient evidence to 
support such a decision.  (Unfortunately, we expect the settlement to be 
protested.)  Direct testimony is due May 5.  To streamline things, the 
parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by 
topic.  Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.  I plan to put Mr. 
Fawcett on as a witness.  Our issue is not particularly controversial 
anymore, so I do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination; nevertheless, I 
will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing, 
which begins May 30.
Jeffery Fawcett
04/17/2000 03:42 PM
As you know, approximately one year ago Transwestern first learned of a dark 
cloud looming on the regulatory horizon in California.  The CPUC in its draft 
Order on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding in May, 1999 listed, among 
a variety of "promising options," the institution of Mojave's "Hector Road" 
as a commercial receipt point into the SoCalGas system.  In fact, the CPUC 
held in its "Findings of Fact" with regard to Hector Road that:

 - It is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of 
transmission resources if SoCalGas were to define its marketable transmission 
access in a way that did not include the Hector Road facilities, and

 - The failure to provide at least window-style access through Hector Road 
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas 
into Southern California.

The basis for the CPUC finding came from testimony taken during the 
proceeding indicating that the use of Hector Road displaces deliveries to the 
constrained delivery point at Wheeler Ridge.  In other words, whatever could 
be delivered by Mojave at Hector Road frees-up space at Wheeler Ridge, a 
delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.

As first articulated by SoCalGas in its draft settlement proposal in the 
summer of 1999, the Hector Road point would be established as a formal 
receipt point into SoCalGas, with rights equal to Transwestern's delivery 
point at North Needles.  With a meter capacity of 200 MMcf/d, and with the 
market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at Hector Road, 
Transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 200 MMcf/d of 
access rights into SoCalGas at North Needles.  Using an average transport 
rate of $0.25/Mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19MM 
per year.

Through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an 
educational process begun by Transwestern during one of the early settlement 
meetings back in September 1999, Transwestern went from a party with a 
"bullseye" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders were 
depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.  As it 
stands now, the Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, "Primary and 
Secondary Receipt Point Access Rights" is nearly identical to the principles 
outlined by Transwestern in that September settlement meeting.

I only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work has 
accomplished.  Not only am I proud to see that the resulting Settlement 
Agreement filed with the CPUC today treats Transwestern and its shippers 
equitably, but I'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this 
effort functioned like a "well oiled machine."

I thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.  We know we've 
still got a lot of work to do to gain CPUC approval of this document, but no 
matter what happens, we can be proud of what was accomplished here.

	
	

Glen, I'm faxing you Transwestern's signature page and declaration.  An 
electronic version of the declaration is attached.

I'm planning to be out August 28 - Sept 1.

Lia Hernandez, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at ENA effective 
August 2, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Lia's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.  In 
addition, Lia's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.

Matt -- are you going to have Snake Hill sign as well?  I can e-mail the 
agreement to him if you prefer.  
Thanks.

Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a 
nonconforming agreement filed 
by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to 
do, if I understand the 
concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP 
but he (like everyone else)
is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
the docket I assume there were 
no problems with the filing.

I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
as nego. rate approach.
If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
will draft something and send it your way.

* * *
The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
under DMP's Rate Schedule
FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
specifies that KGS will pay
a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible 
transportation service rate as
set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
KGS' maximum daily reservation 
quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
identifies five primary delivery points for 
KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to 
the above negotiated rate so 
that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm 
rate schedule.

As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000 
MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California 
at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In 
part, they are alleging that TW is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the 
GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under 
TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump 
alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper 
attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate 
to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean 
USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit 
shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  
Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point 
is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under 
which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT 
will bump firm shippers.

I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, 
I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes 
today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also -- 
you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone 
else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a 
chance...
Thanks!

Hey there, enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures!  Just a quick note 
to say that Bill will be coming with me this weekend, so Mema will have more 
than enough entertainment.  Tell Jim to bring his tennis gear and if the 
weather cooperates we can play.  He would probably enjoy hitting with Bill.  

Saw Bruce Springsteen last night, even though I'm really not much of a fan.  
Ann really wanted to go, and I knew it would be a good show (which it was).  
He played for 3 hours and needless to say I'm pretty worthless this a.m.

Look forward to seeing you soon.

S.

Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks.

Frank and Steve, see the attached.  My theory, which is based on our 
experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint 
ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the 
Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation 
of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with 
the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a 
gathering company).  Although it seems likely that other pipelines have 
entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.

Do you agree with my conclusion?  Any other ideas or insights?  Please let me 
know.  Thanks.

Susan I need some regulatory help in determining some possible deal 
structures.  We are working with Agave to develop a storage facility near the 
West Tx lateral in Eddy County, NM.  My original thought was both parties 
would share in the development costs and own equity interests in the 
facility.  TW would then lease out storage space to shippers plus use storage 
capacity to augment our Park N Ride capability.  The storage would be 
connected via lateral to our W Tx line.

But then it occurred to me how do we share ownership between regulated and 
non-regulated entities?

Do you have some time Friday morning to talk about this?  thanks

Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff 
allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.  There is good 
precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long 
as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the 
attached memo).  Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address 
the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this. 

 

You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers 
to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.  The answer is no.  
If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and 
storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a 
column for "Pre-approved Terms" and one for "Non Pre-Approved Terms".  
Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal 
Dept's approval.  Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for 
the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's 
approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?  As far as I 
know our marketers have been following this.  I spoke with TK and she is 
aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any 
contract that deviates from our standard language.  She has also discussed 
this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the 
policy.  

If we need to discuss this further please let me know.

Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our 
consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.  Our consulting agreement with IGS (which 
has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated 
using the net present value of any contract "identified by IGS" and entered 
into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the 
agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS 
is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive 
fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, 
Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup 
Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while 
Mark can certainly claim he "identified" the deal, he was not alone in doing 
so. 

Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to 
Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money 
they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good 
working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we 
could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive 
fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the 
only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, 
this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.  
The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we 
use in calculating net present value.

If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to 
IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit 
that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do 
decide to take us to court.

Jeff, didn't realize everyone else was going to use narrative format.  Now 
that I've had a chance to think about it, I think ours will look silly if 
it's in Q&A format.  I'll work on changing it this evening.

Jeffery Fawcett
04/28/2000 04:32 PM
fyi

Thanks Jeff.?? Your testimony is in the Q&A format, not the narrative, but 
I'm not certain that will be a problem.? Originally, I was thinking we would 
package the testimony here and send them out to the ALJ in a one-piece 
package.? Because I'm not sure we will be able to do that logistically given 
the last minute changes I expect, we may all just file separately.? I'll let 
you know Mon-Tues what we decide.

Brian, 
I'm forwarding to you the first draft of Transwestern's GIR testimony.? As 
you can see, there are several holes yet to be filled in, particularly with 
respect to cites/references.? However, as concerns content, I'd appreciate 
any comments/proposed changes anyone would like to offer here.? I'm not 
sure if I have the latest Email distribution list, so please feel free to 
forward this on to anyone I've inadvertently left off.? Thanks. 

(See attached file: jcftestimony.doc) 

Keith, last week you and I discussed briefly Facilities Planning's proposal 
to change the service factor on the Gallup compressor in order to increase 
capacity.  I believe you had concluded that a certificate application would 
be necessary.  Now Arnold Eisenstein is asking me (thru our commercial 
people) whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated 
capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the 
compressor -- in other words, through a pressure commitment.  My initial 
impression is yes, we would have to make a filing.  Am I out of my mind?  
Does this make sense?  Please advise.

Drew, I've attached my proposed changes to the Red Cedar contract.  Our 
beloved Min/Max Language became a bit problematic, as you can see.  I'd 
welcome your comments on this.

Steve's new idea is to send a letter to Mark asking him to document/explain 
exactly what his role was in getting this deal.  Comments?  Not sure I care 
one way or the other, but after I see how it looks in writing, I'll have a 
better idea of whether this is how we should approach it.

Multi-tasking heavily today.  I'll send you a draft of our PNM answer to 
Dynegy protest by close of business.

   
	
	

Ugh.  I just got this today and think I understand the problem.  Let me know 
how Steve's conversation with Baldwin goes.  Thanks. DF

Susan, are you preparing a response to their intervention?  MK

Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if 
possible.

We do not really have anything that specific, but I could at least point out 
that the San Juan lateral is fully subscribed.

   
	
	

Susan, would it be beneficial to add more about the need for the service.  Do 
we have customers who have made verbal requests for the service that could be 
used, or other types of market demand to further illustrate the need?  

Glen

   
	
	

Looks good to me.  Thanks. DF

   
	
	

Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if

Here is the quick & dirty.

None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are "tested and placed in 
service."  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.

Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.

From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to 
revoke our "in-service" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was "in 
service" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.

Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be.  

Sounds like a great idea -- let us know where/when.

The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is 
not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The 
engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not 
harmful to the compressor for the short term.

It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to 
vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be 
reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any 
further feedback.

TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the 
vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which 
can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit 
piping. 

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have 
decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction 
strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.  
The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It 
is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running 
without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running 
intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run 
time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should 
have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed 
with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.

It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while 
the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the 
reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment 
or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

Lorraine:  here's Keith's brief response to your question about increasing 
capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the 
Gallup compressor.  Let me know where we need to go from here.  
***
Susan, my understanding is that the capacity west to the California border is 
a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).  If in any way we try to change the 
certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.  TW is 
different than NNG, in that TW certificates capacity rather than facilities.  
Arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.  
Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.

Keith

Bummer.  Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule.
Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC.  We hiked down Bright Angel 
trail to the second rest stop, which was plenty for me.  It was pretty hot.  
Wish we could have stuck around longer but Bill had to be back for a trial.  
Talk about restrictive travel schedules.  
I was thinking about you and Karin and wanting to take your customary nature 
trips...you know, when Grayson is a little older, we could go on some trips 
and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else 
goes hiking/climbing/whatever.  You might have to pay for extra hotel days 
that way, but at least you would get to go.  In the meantime, what about 
staying in one place for a week or so -- a beach house, for example.  Eric 
permitting, I think it would be fun to get everyone together in Florida or 
Colorado sometime within the next year.
My car is ready at the shop.  Yay!
Ciao,
Sus.

Sus:

Not to complain,but AARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now that we have canceled our reservations for the cabin at Zion for the end
of October, because Eric's window of opportunity for travel in California
was limited to that specific two week period, and have been on the phone for
a week making earlier arrangements and putting a deposit down, it seems
that, "well, you see there is this car race in Carmel and, well we would
really rather go earlier in the month"

Well we lost the cabin and spent money for accommodations that are not as
good, and that's why we checked before.

Jeff, we only need to send a copy to the Judge electronically.  This is why 
we've only seen a few from the other parties (I'm starting to receive some in 
the mail and will get you copies).  I'll do so promptly.  I'll e-mail one to 
Brian Cherry as well, and to anyone else who specifically requests it.  If 
you would prefer that I send to everyone electronically, let me know.  Copies 
were mailed to everyone Friday.

Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch 
at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.  
Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool 
in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon 
and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but 
definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had 
Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip 
home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon 
yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.

I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in 
until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on 
Sunday a.m.?

Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco 
or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it 
on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know.
Love,
Sooz

Camp2scott@aol.com on 05/09/2000 01:37:42 PM
Hi, Sooz!

Hope you had a wonderful time in Ariz, saw all kinds of wonderful things, and
didn't fall into the Canyon and expire.  Hope you took a lot of photos.
Can't wait to hear all about it.

I had a good time with Grayson.  Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun, and
she took them without a whimper.  Karin is feeling liberated!  I think she
wants to quit breastfeeding since she is having to pump at the office, and
everytime Grayson misses a feeding from her.  Jim is upset.  She has an ally
in Eric.  He says, men don't know when to stay out of something like that.
Anyway, Grayson is turning out to be a very happy baby.  Everytime you look
at her, she breaks out in a huge smile.

Are you coming next weekend?  K&J are and have made a couple of hc appts.
One is for 6:45 Fri which they fear they won't be able to make.

Trying to get some enthusiasm to pull out all the dead ground cover and plant
something else, but so far, can't seem to get the momentum.  Everything else
is looking pretty good with all our rains.  Except that the shrub people
raped the photinias by the street.  They say they should come back nicely.
We'll see.

Is there someplace you can find info about the car races in Sept?  Eric has a
free ticket he needs to use by Nov 15.  I don't know how this would work with
our CA trip planned for Oct. 3-17.  Had no problem getting a place to stay in
Carmel and we're working out from there.  We'll probably stay in Santa Cruz
about 4 nights so we can do some sailing.

Anxious to hear from you,  love, mum

Dear Judge Biren:

Attached is the Prepared Direct Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf of 
Transwestern Pipeline Company in Support of the Comprehensive Settlement 
Agreement that has been designated as Exhibit 12.  Hard copies of these 
documents were delivered to you on Friday, May 5.  Please contact me if there 
is any problem opening the electronic version.

Susan Scott

susan.scott@enron.com

Brian:  here is the electronic version of Jeff Fawcett's testimony.

Brian:  because of the travel time involved, TW would prefer to reverse the 
schedule on May 24 (i.e., retail first, capacity second) -- if no one has any 
objections/conflicts.

I have scheduled two days of panel practice cross-examination for those 
testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR/NGS proceeding.? The 
first, scheduled for May 24, will be held in the Sutter Room A&B of the 
Hilton Hotel (on O'Farrell) in SFO.? The session is scheduled to go from 
9:00AM to 5:00PM.? Lunch will be brought in.? On May 25, we will meet in the 
same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for 
10:00AM at the Commission's offices.? This practice cross session will start 
no later than 12Noon and go to 4:00PM.? Lunch will also be available.

I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most 
efficiently.? As of today, we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony.? Given 
that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters, I'd like to 
suggest we bifurcate the sessions, devoting May 24 from the hours of 
9:00AM-2:00PM to capacity issues and 2:00PM-5:00PM to the retail panel.? On 
the 25th, we would go from 12Noon-2:30PM on capacity and 2:30-4:00PM on 
retail matters. 

I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective 
witnesses prior to the panel hearings.? We should concentrate on nailing down 
the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach 
alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions.? 
After reviewing the draft testimony's over the last few days, I think we are 
going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the 
Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission's most promising 
options.

We need to start a new "bucket" file called Direct Testimony.  Then please

Thank you!

Hi there!  I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in 
"View" mode on my Lotus Notes.  What a pretty girl!

I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?  Let me know.  I was thinking 
of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just 
me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.  I have no idea what to buy her!  must do 
some shopping today or tomorrow.

Trivia time:  last night I went to the Astros game with some people from 
work.  One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.  She 
likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!  She told me she has a dog 
called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."  Now you know!

Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.

Love,
proud auntie sooz

Hi! I sent a picture of Grayson to multiple people including you. I have
never done a mass mailing before and not sure if i did it right. Please let
me know if you received it! If not I will try again! If you DID get it, let
me know if you have any problems opening it. I hope you had a good trip and
hope to see you in Austin for Mother's Day!

Byeee!

remember, you can also e-mail me at work now! kss@overlandpartners.com

Rich and Dave, attached are my suggested revisions to Mike McLeod's draft of 
an amendment to the original electric service agreement.  Dave, I'll bring 
you a copy of that agreement.  Rich, if Mike did not send you one, let me 
know and I will fax it to you.  

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you 
described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.  Please let me know 
if it looks alright to you.  I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, 
then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.  My sincerest apologies 
for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to 
handling, and I appreciate your patience.

P.S. -- Dave, on your wish list you had included an evergreen provision.  See 
Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such 
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

What if we replace Section 2 with something like "This Agreement shall 
continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,"  and 
replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to 
the intended date of termination."

Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

Looks like you nailed the least cost billing provision pretty good.  Just 
need to abrogate our remaining term and make all agreements evergreen.

Hi Brian!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.  Scott is 
a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a 
sweetie!  Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on 
babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to 
understand the command "Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on," 
I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush 
to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow 
I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!

I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great 
thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is 
just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.  
The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch "ER," that is usually what my 
day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group 
I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open 
work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in 
business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  

Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.

Time to hit the tennis courts.

Love,
Susan

Susan,

Hi, how are you doing? I got your e-mail address from Aunt Sheila. I had
earlier gotten her e-mail address from my Dad and sent her an e-mail after
hearing about Karin giving birth. So how about that! Are you excited about
being an Aunt? I can accept being an uncle much more than being a dad. I am
in no hurry to have kids. Actually, I am in no hurry to get married. I think
I would be  good dad, although I would have to settle down a bit. But that
won't happen anytime soon, as I am enjoying the Tampa area too much. I moved
down here last August and am loving it.

I just got done taking the CPA exam and am scheduled to take the FL Bar exam
in July. So I will not be enjoying FL too much for the next few months. I
just thought I would drop you a line and see how you are doing. How is
Houston? Are you still enjoying it there? How's the job? Have you made
partner yet? Have you seen much of Grayson since her birth? Well enough ?'s,
I have to go. Let me know how you are doing! Take care.

Your cousin,

Brian

Here are my standard rules for my witnesses on examination by opposing 
counsel.  They are worth learning well ahead of time because they can be very 
difficult to follow.  Memorize these and we'll do fine on cross (assuming we 
even get any questions).

1.  Listen carefully to the question.
2.  Answer only that question; do not volunteer more.
3.  If you don't know for sure what the answer is, just say so.
4.  If you cannot answer a "yes" or "no" question with "yes" or "no," say so 
and explain why.

Thought you'd be interested in this.

Hi Mum!  I'm up for birthday celebration this weekend.  Can you believe I 
actually have a gift for Jim already?  I'll try to get there as early as I 
can tomorrow.  Bill will not be coming with me because he has too much work 
piled up, including clients to visit in jail!  My first priority is sleep as 
I have not gotten much this week -- I keep waking up in the middle of the 
night; it's miserable.  To make things worse, I think a ghost has appeared to 
Goo.  She is really freaked out about something, pacing around and acting 
like she hears things.  Gabby is her usual self.

How's the pool?  I'll bring my suit just in case...

Love,
Sooz

Camp2scott@aol.com on 05/11/2000 03:33:21 PM
Hi, Sooz!

Hope you haven't had to try to play catch-up since returning from your trip.

I was just thinking since we'll all be together this weekend, maybe I'll bake
a birthday cake for Jim.  His birthday is the 20th.  Don't worry about having
to have a gift ready.  I'm not going to give him his gift until next week.  I
haven't heard for sure, but they will probably leave Sat., maybe after
dinner, like before.

Did Karin tell you Grayson had used red paint with her feet in nursery the
other day?!  Karin is wondering what kind of "craft" she made.  It must be
something for Mother's Day!!

High Fidelity, the new John Cusak movie is very good.  Joan is in it as well.

See you soon!  love, mum   p.s. is Bill coming?

I'll just get with Ramona in the a.m. and see when she can meet & we'll go 
from there.

Here's a draft of a research memo on options.  While I am hopeful that we can 
overcome FERC's policy on reservation of capacity, our arguments obviously 
need to be developed a little more before we can do that.  I know the 
business folks are anxious to hear our strategy.  I would appreciate your 
comments on the attached.  

Your "courtesy copy" of the draft I sent to MK, Drew and Shelley.  We'll put 
our heads together and come up with a final version.

Please ignore my previous e-mail which included the wrong attachment.

Ted, please see if they will agree to Texas law (see last paragraph).  If 
not, let me know.
Otherwise, this looks fine.

Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute 
nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone 
tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on 
her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut 
because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example:  
over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to 
shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies 
receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a 
message.  Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.

Hope your holiday was really great!

Why is it some family members are more courteous to strangers than to each
other?

Wow!  So true!!!  Have a good Monday!

Please let me know if you have comments.

I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Ashley -- here is a lease renewal letter.  Pumpkin is welcome to stay over at 
your place.  In fact, if you or Deron need me to check in on her at any time, 
walk her, etc., you really should not hesitate to call me (713-864-4960)!  I 
love dogs and wish I could justify having one!

Hi Mum!  I had a fun time this weekend.  It was good to have everyone 
together.  Glad K&J are relaxing about Mema and the baby.  She gets such a 
kick out of seeing her.  Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we 
let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!  

Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.  Earlier when I was in a 
meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 
610.  Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.

Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good 
night's sleep last night.  What a relief.  I have really never had this 
problem before.  It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down 
sometime.

Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.  The following week (May 29 
- June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have 
to be there that long.

Have a good afternoon!

Love,
Sooz

Camp2scott@aol.com on 05/15/2000 12:30:28 PM
Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.  I really do wish
Houston were at least an hour closer.

Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.  I wish
Karin had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.  I really
appreciate all your work.

Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:  Putin, the new Russian
president, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, " George W.
Bush wants to know if you're related to Ras Putin."

Darrell and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very well
and doubled back before reaching the bridge.  I think I was all tuckered out
from our Sun. walk.

The 3 of us were trying to get together for Darrell's birthday lunch, so I'm
going to make lunch here on Sat.  Cathy is coming into town for a haircut and
K&J&G will be here since Karin has an appt. as well.  We usually go out to
lunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!

I'm cleaning up the house from the weekend today.  Hope you have a good week.
 love, mum

Please join me tomorrow, Wednesday May 17th, at 3:00 p.m. in room 4194 to 
discuss some of the details of implementing Transwestern's potential fuel 
monetization service.  Thanks!

Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to 
SF next Tues. thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.  I had thought about 
going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Boston 
the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better 
weekend for me to hang out in Cali.  It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway 
because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be 
presented.  I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!  Makes it 
really hard to plan.  I'll know for sure by the 25th.  Thank goodness for 
refundable airline tickets.  Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend 
of June?  And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or 
Wednesday?  These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but 
my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses 
and leave.

Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.  He was 
in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.  I 
joined him a few days later in Vegas.  Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 
nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.  We set out for 
Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 
66 of course).  Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of 
rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) 
and got real dusty and sunburned.  Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and 
hung out at the South Rim.  Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & 
back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the 
redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.    I would really 
love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the 
next.  

Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul

S.

Lynn -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for TW.  This is very much a 
work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics.  
We've invited Darrell and Richard to the meeting; if there is anyone else you 
think we should include just let me know.

On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has 
certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, PNM will "have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission."   Lorraine 
has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know.

Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to 
Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper).

Here is the language you requested for our posting:

In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of 
Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern 
for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges.

If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

Please see the attached in connection with sales of capacity options on TW.

Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to 
FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.

	
	

I agree with Glen's comments,  anything greater than the allowed MDQ can flow 
or be scheduled, but it would be at the IT rate.  Based on the contract, the 
overrun rate is usually the same as the firm rate so I don't believe there is 
a revenue issue.  Keep in mind, when a day is limited the mdq is "reduced" 
systemiatically  to that level so anything greater is overrun.  MK

   
	
	

Although I would like to collect the LFT revenue in the second example on 
60%, isn't the extra unanticipated  10% TI? The tariff is vague in regard to 
partial days.  It appears we could call a partial limited day  based on a 
percentage of the MDQ or a specific volume level however once we have 
announced the firm level haven't we made a commitment only to that level of 
MDQ on a firm basis and any other volumes that might flow would be regarded 
as overrun?

Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does "interested parties" mean? parties 
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their 
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like 
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone 
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that "individual bid transactions are kept confidential."  
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's 
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of 
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get 
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend 
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them "sealed bids" on 
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish 
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially 
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our 
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example 
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  "an" Capacity Trading Agreement should be "a" Capacity Trading 
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we 
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for 
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each 
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.  
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or 
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating "You must submit a Request for 
Service prior to making your initial bid" so they don't think they have to 
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under "When TW will Respond":  need to specify how notification will 
be sent.  

Page 14:  Column that says "Price" should say "Rate" (for a second there we 
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates 
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any 
questions.

print the form, fill it out and fax it to us because it is our understanding 
that we can't work it into the website for completion and execution online in 
the time frame for July 1 service. 

Also, please note that (1) we have changed the some of the information in the 
Account Manager grid and (2) the attached draft assumes that the Bid List, 
from the original text, is the same document as the Account Manager page .  

We are assuming that we would not be able to get the Transportation Service 
Agreement available for online execution by clicking for July 1. Thus, we 
will handle the service agreement manually. However, for subsequent months we 
contemplate establishing contracting procedures so that the service agreement 
can be executed online by a click. 

Frazier and Tony

 When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on 
another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 
(1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream 
pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas 
transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one 
of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, 
the Commission stated:  

The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has 
acquired on an upstream 
pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the 
gas on the upstream 
pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will 
not, however, allow the pipeline 
to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will 
be the shipper on the upstream 
pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results 
in a limited exception to the rule 
that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. 

I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this 
filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel 
free to pass this along to your contact at PNM.

Well, I wanted you to have something to open ON your birthday. 
Greetings from San Francisco!
I'm told we're having "earthquake weather" today.  Don't know what that 
means, but it sounds scary!
Hi to K. and G.! 

Yes , I saw it . You are the coolest sister-in-law one could possibly ask
for.
You didn't really need to do that since you already got me the tennis stuff,
but i wont complain, i always like to buy new books.

thanks again,
jim

I forgot to tell you to check your FBCat e-mail for a birthday surprise!
If it did not arrive, let me know.  Hope y'all had a good weekend.

In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format 
posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here 
is my 2 cents' worth.

The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal 
section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See 
Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  "All available capacity shall be allocated 
under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm 
transportation queue."  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding 
procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid 
deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the 
ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the 
one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the 
EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit 
bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).

The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the 
General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue 
to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically 
provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.

I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an 
online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the 
flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.

Hope this helps.  If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, 
and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.  My 
hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to 
talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234).

I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 
75261.151@compuserve.com.

That's all this elf knows.

Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone 
is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend  to a dinner party 
given by some people she doesn't even know.  Although I am trying very hard 
to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.  When I was in her 
situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had 
a date or not!  But that's just me.  

Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.  We certainly are here.  
If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come 
before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!  (You will 
still have to wear sunscreen).  What are your trip dates again?

Have a good day!

Hi Susan,

Attached below is the draft discount letter to Lorraine's 10 year SWG deal.  
Please review and provide any revisions if necessary.  FYI,  the base FTS-1 
agreement will show that SWG will only have capacity November-March of each 
year.  Therefore do you agree that  my discount language does not need to 
incorporate the Nov-March term designation since the discount rate paragraph 
3 states that the rate shall be multiplied by the total contract quantity (0 
MMcf/d) contract quantity April-Oct)?

Thanks for your expedited review.

Approved.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas 
Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 
Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 
2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by 
$.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau 
(EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from 
the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In 
additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity 
release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate.

(Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount 
letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through 
October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 
of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a "seasonal rate", the 
effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.)

Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals 
shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval.

Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the 
function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since 
he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the 
distribution list.  I know that he has access to the same info, but to give 
him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.  

I am out of town, but if you have any questions please e-mail or leave me a 
voice mail, and I will reply after my hearing today.

   
	
	

Since he works for the same group that does our VAR calculation he should 
already have our positions, go ahead and send him the book, unless Susan 
Scott has a problem.  Susan, let us know if you have a problem.

Dan,

Jan has suggested that Eugenio Perez is setup on distribution for the book.  
I'm not sure about putting him on the distribution since is a ECTN employee.  
However, according to Jan he works in the group that provides ET&S with the 
VAR calculation.  What do you think or should Susan Scot have final say.

Let me know.

Debbie
Jan Johnson
05/17/2000 04:15 PM
He works for Sally Beck.  Her group does VAR for all of Enron, so in that 
function he is Global.  He doesn't share any of the information he collects 
on the business units with any of the trading or commercial people, to ensure 
we have no market affiliate problems.  Is that enough protection or will we 
need to do more to separate him?

Jan

Debbie Moseley
05/17/2000 04:08 PM
Jan, who does Eugenio Perez work for?  When I typed in his name, it indicated 
he was with ECT.  

Thanks, Debbie

Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no 
reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those 
months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would 
work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I 
recall correctly.

Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if 
SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case FERC does not 
like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by 
FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT 
contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the 
rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are 
attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to 
renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Christine, let me know which is 
preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m.

   
	
	

It seems to me that if the capacity is only for the months of Nov-Mar, the 
reference to the discounted rate in section 2 should state that it is for the 
period Nov-Mar through 2010.  Also, the language in paragraph 6 should 
eliminate the reference to the tariff, since we don't have it, just start 
with the phrase "Shipper agrees that if it utilizes -----
See previous comment as well.  Need to make sure we want to commit to a 10 
year discount, as policy may change and Tw would be required to absord the 
difference.  MK

Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge 
asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an 
exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge mentioned 
she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised that you 
did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at least to let 
us review the exhibit.  I would like to review the exhibit as soon as 
possible.  I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or fax it to 
941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).  Also, I should be reachable on my mobile 
phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office (713-853-0596).  

Glen, thanks for the quick response.  The process the parties agreed upon 
yesterday is acceptable to TW.

Sorry to hear there was an emergency at home; I hope all is well by now.

At the ALJ's direction, this subject was discussed among the parties who
were present in the hearing room yesterday at the lunch break and again
after the conclusion of hearings for the day.  The parties present reached
agreement on a process for this exhibit.

I had to leave for home immediately after the discussions in the hearing
room at the end of yesterday due to a family emergency.

I am informed the results of these discussions were put on the record today.
I understand that SoCalGas will provide to all parties by June 16 a draft of
the exhibit.  Parties can then comment to SoCalGas and we will attempt to
get a consensus by June 21.  SoCalGas will file by June 21 either a version
that has concensus, or failing concensus, its own version of what it thinks
the exhibit should show.  Parties who do not agree with what SoCalGas files
on June 21 can file on June 23 either their own version or comments on
SoCalGas' version.

I cannot absolutely guarantee the accuracy of the above details since I was
not present today and there is no transcript yet for today.

If this arrangement is not acceptable to Transwestern, you should object to
the ALJ immediately.  Hearings are scheduled to conclude after the lunch
break today.

Also, I am informed that SCGC has distributed in the hearing room and will
attempt to introduce today a written exhibit that includes an extensive
discussion of its views on the subject of "mismatches" of delivery and
take-away capacity at the California border.

Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge
asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop
an exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge
mentioned she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised

my mobile phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office
(713-853-0596).

Luckily, we will have input re. the exhibit, and if SoCal does not cooperate 
to make it accurate, we will be able to file our own with an explanation.  
Lad is such a weasel.  Why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m.

Well unfortunately, Ladd managed to confuse the judge as to the Upstream
capacity into the Socal system. In doing so he has potentially opened up a
"real" danger for TW at Hector Rd. and again completely left out of his
testimony S.Needles aka Topock capacity of 200 mmcfd. Now Socal will try to
poll the parties so as to prepare a consensus Exhibit that will put "fact"
to the upstream capacities into the Socal system. Well, I fear that the
other pipeline lines will shape the facts to their agendas and we will have
a distorted landscape into the Socal system. The downside I perceive is that
the judge will 1) want to Let the Market decide via increasing the maximum
receipt point capacity allowed  or 2) want further comments on the entire
Socal receipt point capacity structure. These two onerous outcomes can be
avoided if the judge receives a consensus Exhibit(at least from the
Settlement parties) that is explained in a consistent manner  and with
common terms. For example, if we look at just FERC capacities in lieu of
perfect design capacities we might calm down these issues.

We will likely lead this process for the CSA parties, Lets discuss Monday
morning. Hope everything went well in Florida, especially you Jeff . I hope
you just banged up your pride and not your body to badly.

Mark, IGS

I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated 
Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.   I have a call in to 
Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you 
in that loop in case you get any inquiries.  (My initial, unofficial reaction 
is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the 
fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no 
difference to the FERC.)  Until further notice, I would avoid any 
communication with ENA on these issues.  If you have any questions, please 
e-mail or call me (x30596).

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Tony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate 
pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it 
must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some 
other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that 
capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not 
find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, 
the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up 
with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory 
basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to 
its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and 
there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying 
presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is 
awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting 
discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this 
even though it should be obvious.

Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA 
(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. 
basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers 
of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the 
capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we 
will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to 
participate in the auction process.  

Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the 
effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the 
Enrononline process.

Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we 
could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for 
determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  
In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  "The 
Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season 
provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid 
evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing 
different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different 
transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology 
before the bidding process begins."  The only problem is I am not sure we 
have that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post 
a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some 
language allowing us to do so.

I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what 
you write I'd be happy to.

If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, 
either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by 
about 9:30 and we can talk about it then. 

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.  

I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the 
late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at 
sooner, that would be great...TW's business people who need to look at it 
will be out at the beginning of next week.  Thanks.

Something's up with our e-mail, but I did receive it finally.  Thanks.

Hmmmm...I sent it out a few hours ago.? Didn't you receive it ?

I would expect that Sarah Tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make 
good on our promise.

   
	
	

Assuming they are willing to withdraw their protest if we agree to this level 
of capacity, do they plan to attend the Tech. Conf.?

Brian,
Transwestern has reviewed your draft exhibit responsive to Judge Biren's 
inquiry on June 7.  We appreciate your work on it and generally agree with 
the exhibit and the approach taken by SoCalGas.  However, we think it 
appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge 
Biren's questions.  

See the attached marked-up version of the exhibit.  We've attempted to 
streamline the data provided for "non-Wheeler" points, and to clarify the 
footnotes regarding Wheeler Ridge.  Also, we've modified the numbers 
regarding the TW Topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 400 
MMcf/d physical capability.  We've also made some minor formatting changes.

Let us know what you think.

Tony, I'd love to see our posting on EnronOnline -- do you know if there's an 
easy way for us "insiders" to access it?

You got mail from Norm!

     Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
rights. or some other number?

In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the 
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign 
"primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.  The 
establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues 
currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you 
are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available 
receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me 
offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.

Attached is Shelley Corman's response to Jeff Dasovich, based on 
conversations with Drew and me.  Accordingly, I would advise you not to 
participate in the conference call Jeff is setting up for tomorrow.

Questions -- give me a call.

Jeff,

From the pipeline group's perspective, this transaction is a commercial 
matter between El Paso and ENA.  Accordingly, the gas pipeline group does not 
believe that it is appropriate to participate in the development of ENA's 
response.  

I do understand that the referenced article and certain of the protests make 
factual allegations about Transwestern's available capacity to California.   
Susan Scott or I can certainly provide corrected information from 
Transwestern's available capacity postings.   

Jeff Dasovich @ EES on 01/04/2000 11:23:33 AM
i would like to set up a conference call for tomorrow, jan. 5 at 3:30 CST to 
discuss the ena/el paso deal.  please let me know if 1) you would like to be 
on the call, and 2) you are available at that time.  thanks, jeff

Jeff Dasovich on 01/02/2000 07:19:57 PM
please read be story from trade press below.  i have not included et&s folks 
on this note because i'm uncertain regarding the rules with respect to 
communication among business units in these sorts of matters.  if it's 
acceptable to include tw in the notes and in conversations, that would be my 
preference.  rick, is it your view that tw can or cannot be included?

i believe i passed along word of the ena/el paso deal when it hit the press 
week before last.  the press reported both the amount of capacity and the 
price for which ena bought it from el paso.  to summarize:  ena purchased 
1.25 bcf per day for one year starting jan 1, 2000.  ena paid $38 million, 
which gives an average price of $.0831 per mmbtu.  (by contrast, williams 
bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   el paso released 
this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena.  
julie, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.

the situation is complicated by the fact that california is currently in the 
midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.  
the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very 
contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, california 
manufacturers association, and muni generators from southern california to 
push a very "go slow" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger 
users.  enron is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, 
calpine, southern california edison, green mountain power, the city of 
vernon, and spurr/remac (provides services to california's k-12 school 
system) under an alliance called "california alliance for competition" 
(snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, 
state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable 
rights in a secondary market.

indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has 
cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for 
enron, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip 
launched against el paso at ferc regarding el paso's nom process.  (i believe 
ena filed in support of the suit.)  el paso is losing that one and will 
likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.

i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent 
message on the ena deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with 
the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we 
can do to keep harvey morris (and california) from mucking up the deal, the 
better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much 
"educating" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.  
more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.

let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the 
issue.

best,
jeff

CPUC attorney Harvey Morris obviously has NO CLUE on how the transportation 
business works.

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to 
respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to 
the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit 
drafting process.  Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the 
exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC 
filings, for that matter).  If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response 
part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record 
already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be 
allowed into the record.  
Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions.
I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let 
you know if he does.

Susan:

 Good response.  Be advised that Norm is a little out of order asking
discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not
obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying
to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the
California border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either
SoCal or PG&E without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this
again.  Thanks, Mike

     Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
(See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
I.99-07-003).doc)
 - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO I.99-07-003).doc

Mike, obviously this is unacceptable.  Norm's exhibit contains factual 
inaccuracies we cannot live with.  I'm assuming the rest of the group will 
react similarly and Norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit.  Your thoughts?

Brian, just so you know Transwestern's reaction, Pedersen's exhibit contains

any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.  

With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels 
there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the 
border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would 
support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently 
drafted for purposes of this proceeding.

Any questions or comments -- let me know.

Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be
made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment 
to
parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first 
attachment
is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled "Firm Pipeline Capacity into 
Southern
California" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate 
capacity on
El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. "Incoming Interstate Capacity," by 
replacing
the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW 
Gas
which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct 
figure,  2080
MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from 
the
col. "Total Take-away Capacity" since this capacity is not firm capacity 
available
to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by 
these
changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El 
Paso
have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to 
SoCalGas
totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock
and clearly creates a "mismatch"; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the
physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at
Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering
is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics
intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and
interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual 
physical
interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate
impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several
separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that 
several
interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso
understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to
Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning
"mismatches" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas
receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose 
SoCalGas
filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the 
changes
and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.   Very truly yours, Edward

Amazing that TW has not one but TWO people doing this job.
Your tree-saving efforts are admirable.

Glen,

Please see Kevin's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate 
distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like 
Kevin's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels 
either All Holders or Filings.   Dennis Lee is currently working to put 
Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that 
the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to 
consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's.

Hi Naomi, 
my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am the marketing director in Houston for 
Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send 
me only those tariff page copies slated for "insertion" into our tariff books 
and not the pages that are "submitted for filing"?  

My reason is this: by the time the "submitted for filing" pages get to me, 
it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) 
and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.

If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I 
understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I 
do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to 
save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and 
distribution costs.

Let me know what you think.
thanks

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement 
shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that 
was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the 
replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away.  
(It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we 
should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the 
replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff 
someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to 
our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to 
just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with 
some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow 
us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals 
this might not be practicable, though.  

Further questions...let me know.

Ramona Betancourt
06/20/2000 02:04 PM
Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these "02" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that "The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Ramona, "total cost commitment" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue 
to be received from a transaction, taking 
into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity 
revenues associated with any minimum 
throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items 
aren't applicable in the PNR context; the 
language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR 
we would just multiply rate times number 
of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how 
this is done if you have an interruptible service with 
no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the 
number of days in the contract term.  

If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max 
rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We 
do not have to offer a right to match.

Ramona Betancourt
06/19/2000 03:52 PM
Susan,

I am working with TK on automating TW's PNR allocation process & I was 
reviewing the tariff rules for TW PNR allocation of service on sheet 37e. 
Section 8.

Can you interpret the meaning of "total cost commitment"? We state that 
buyers willing to pay more than the maximum tariff rate will be considered to 
be paying the maximm rate and we will pro-rate amoung buyers willing to pay 
the same total cost commitment. Does this mean we must offer a right to 
match? What does the term "total cost commitment mean?

Thanks Ramona

Steve, for your information, the case in which the Commission denied ECT's 
petition for a limited waiver of 
the shipper must have title rule appears at 84 FERC P 61,222. 

Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.

If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
Monday morning.

The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
I do not end up with another weekend like the last.

I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
but I'll let you know.

Call if you get lonely! 

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready
to get back into my solo mode.

Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a
good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all
the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long
though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's
visit.

I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art
day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing
through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars.
 (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)

Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum

So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.  
If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as 
early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set 
up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other.
Thank you.

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Sempra Energy 
Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement 
allowing Sempra the right to "call" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to 
availability, at a $.30 rate,  Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of 
East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.  
Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at 
$.30/Dth (their "call" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles 
capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.

Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion 
Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 
and 4:

 Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in 
Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas' 
"window"  can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas.  
Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas 
indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate 
delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either 
not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT 
Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport 
shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.

Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October 
transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from 
SoCalNeedles to PG&E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG 
interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification 
period.  Sempra may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles 
delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.

Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any questions arise, 
please contact me at x35702.

Tony -- here's an excerpt from PG&E's tariff on curtailment of service.

If you are curious about any of the rest of their tariff, see the "Gas Rules" 
portion of their website at
http://www.pge.com/customer_services/business/tariffs/#GR
 

Tony, here's another page that has a Gas Quality section.

Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure 
the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can 
attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough 
input on Fri.

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in 
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together 
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.

	
	

Given the overwhelming response so far, I think a meeting may be necessary to 
get this project moving.  Thanks. DF

Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be 
coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I 
will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake 
house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.   
Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see 
her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would 
appreciate also:
http://livingisland.com/shows/pufnstuf/

See you soon!

Hi! Fancy hearing from ME! Just checking in to see what your weekend plans
are like when will you be in Austin? Are you bringing Bill? Do you want to
play tennis w/ Jim, etc!  Jim has an appointment to get his fro -glo going
at 12 on Saturday, so we will be hitting Austin that morning and will
probably stay through Sun. evening or possibly Monday morning. They have
decided to give us Monday off, but we still need to get things done around
the house, so we can't loll around in Austin the WHOLE time! Do you know
when Mema will be there? You know, one of these days you are going to get
stuck driving her to Austin! Let me know what's going on! Gbug wants to show
you how she likes to eat her carrots! Mmmmm! And she wants to try out her
boat in the pool.

Bye!

Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill 
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members 
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Enron)
  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.

Hi Mum!  Ann and I saw "Mr. Ripley" and I lay awake last night wondering how 
else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!  I 
think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid 
this blurring of film and reality.  My tendency is to really get involved 
when I see them on the big screen!

Might be going to San Francisco next week.  I'd really like to go.  We'll see.

Probably I will come to Austin on Saturday but I've not heard from the 
landscaper yet.  I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.

Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today.

Love,
Sooz

Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.

Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.

Love,
Sooz

Since I am swamped I've asked Steve Stojic to take a first crack at it.

   
	
	

Susan, are you preparing a response to the comments filed by Amoco and

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas 
Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor "sentence structure" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.

Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.

Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word "volumetric" as 
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly 
to have "volumetric" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  "on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized".  
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more 
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

HELP!
Larry L Black <llblack@attglobal.net> on 07/06/2000 06:52:21 PM
Please respond to llblack@attglobal.net
Lorraine, 
I have your revised letter.? There is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

".....and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized." 

This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written 
now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? Are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

I will talk to you first thing in the morning. 
Thanks. 
Larry

to file the noise survey report.   I will foward a copy to you for your 
records.  Questions, let me know.  Thanks.  Donna

Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to 
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 
FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC 
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that 
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not 
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the 
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes 
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of 
"pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
available" that I thought existed.

(I haven't reviewed this yet but will have a chance to this afternoon.)

Here's the draft I referred to in my e-mail -- let me know if you have 
comments or questions.

At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a 
higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect 
this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could 
have said it, but ...

Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going 
to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.

   
	
	

Susan,  This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement.  In 
section 3 on page 3 we state that TW intends to contract for long-term 
capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority 
and will not be the "lowest priority on PNM".  Please confirm that a contract 
for April to October is long term on PNM.  I initially understood we would 
contract for one month with an evergreen provision or rolling month to month 
type of contract therefore I just wanted to make sure this statement fits 
with our Marketing Depts intent.  Thanks.

Glen

Our consulting agreement with IGS for services related to the CPUC proceeding 
expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.  
Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner 
rather than later...let me know and I'll draft a brief letter to Mark 
Baldwin.

Dear Judge Biren:

Attached is an electronic version of Transwestern Pipeline Company's Opening 
Brief, which will be filed with the Commission today.

Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So 
go ahead and order tickets if you like.  

I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding 
is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I 
could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to 
the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it 
is.

Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I 
have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, 
and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested 
in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?

Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.

Love,
Sooz

Camp2scott@aol.com on 07/13/2000 10:32:35 AM
Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the
Broadway series at the Paramount, and "Chorus Line" is coming for a 2-wk
period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on
a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me
know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.

Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him
when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me
by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go
on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then
you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the
beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's
considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is
good, and it's a good place for me to learn.

Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors!
Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all
this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and
The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a
guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for
skiing.

Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch
yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at
7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait.

Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to
mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see
him.  He's from some town near San Miguel.

K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad
for the company.

Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All
that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent
$800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had
just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with
her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.

Hope you're having a good week.  Did Bill make it home?  love, mum

Oops, I meant to send this note to Mary Darveaux instead -- my apologies!

   
	
	

Susan, I don't believe I'm involved in this filing.   Donna

   
	
	

I know you do not want to think about this today, but I'm just thinking ahead 
to next week.  Let's come up with an action plan for drafting TW's Order 637 
compliance filing.  You two should be experts by now!  Give me a call Monday 
or Tuesday, and let's discuss getting started, and I will get to work on a 
draft.  I still have the marked up tariff sheets from when we talked about 
this in March or April.  

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

   
	
	

pls let me know if this looks ok to you.  thanks df

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY 
INTERACTIVE OPEN SEASON 
APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached file for the announcement of Transwestern's 
Interactive Open Season (IOS) to be held Friday, July 21, 2000.  The 
following summarizes the bidding rules and capacity definition for the two 
bid packages of East of Thoreau (EOT) to California capacity:

 Package 1:
 Volume: 20,000 Dth/d
 Term:  3 months (August - October, 2000)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity 
   of 12,000 Dth/d at Needles, Ca.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.
 
Package 2:
 Volume: 49,000 Dth/d
 Term:  12 Months (November 1, 2000 - Oct. 31, 2001)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity
   of 35,000 Dth/d at Needles, Cal.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.

Bidders may bid on either a 1-part or a 2-part rate structure for the entire 
capacity amount posted.   No partial volume bids are accepted.  Bid packages 
are considered mutually exclusive.     No minimum bid rate is posted 
therefore Transwestern is not obligated to accept any bids if the bids are 
valued as unacceptable.  Transwestern shall award capacity based upon Highest 
Rate criteria.

If any questions arise please contact Christine Stokes at x35702.

Please indicated approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.

   

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review 
beginning TODAY.

   
	
	

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen

Please ignore what I sent you last night and post this instead; it has just a 
couple of typo. changes. Thank you!

& I will send it to the Commercial Group, so you do not need to.

I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request.  
It expires 2/29/00.  The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior 
to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate 
us to agree to any such extension.  

As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide 
any other information you need for the meeting.  

David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective 
August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In 
addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?  
Any comments?
Jeffery Fawcett
07/21/2000 12:36 PM
TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory

4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.  

After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions=
=20
that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quit=
e=20
some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been=
=20
discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline=
=20
site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe=
rs=20
yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the=
=20
phone & discuss this?

List of TW contracting issues

1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate=
=20
policy:

 a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total char=
ge=20
shall include all applicable surcharges."   Should this language be revised=
,=20
and if so, how?

 b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in=
=20
its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined=
=20
rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20
surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio=
ns=20
from the tariff?=20

 c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event=
=20
shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim=
um=20
rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance=
 that=20
the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective? =
=20
necessary?

2.  IOS/EnronOnline:

 a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?

 b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20
subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20
bidding procedures)?

 c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin=
g=20
situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20
evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made?

Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow 
acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles 
interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles 
but does not extend the same privilege to TW.    

I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El 
Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any 
questions or comments to discuss!  

S.

No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go 
this weekend.

So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry 
spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, 
which was starting to smell like cooked grass.

Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to 
make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be 
charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.

The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to 
plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept?
Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.

Time to work!
Love,
Sooz

Camp2scott@aol.com on 07/24/2000 08:50:44 PM
Hi, Sooz,

Don't make a special trip, but the next time you're at the Galleria, would
you go by the Neiman's Clientele make-up counter (by the candy) and get
something for me?  Clientele Wrinkle Treatment.  It'll be pricy, but just let
me know and I'll get a check to you.
love, mum

Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to 
our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed 
as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I 
understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris 
is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order 
to expedite things.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these 
agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.

Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he??
I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the 
one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.  
My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the 
components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one 
component from exceeding the max or going below the min.
Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions!

Please respond to llblack@attglobal.net
Lorraine,
Confirmation that I did receive your executed TSA and Letter Agreement.
I'm so glad you are excited.  We have so little in our lives to give us
true excitement.  At my age, I try to reserve all events of elevated
blood pressure for only the esoteric things.  (Just kidding.)  I'm very
pleased we finally got this done.  Now for the pipe wrench and welder
folks to get the physical jobs done, as well.

Unfortunately, the work is never over.  I will now try to concentrate on
the OBA, which has been sitting by the sideline for a long time.  Will
get back to you on that as soon as I can.

As for the TSA rate, I have a few questions.  We have agreed that TWPL
would allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.  I have
never been clear on just when and how that will be done.  I have assumed
you would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.  Is there
any idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it "once done,
always done"?  Further, what factors do you use to make that
determination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?  From
different views, I'd like to have it all variable and you would like to
have it all fixed.  What is the process here?

I will get back to you soon on the OBA stuff.  Meanwhile, chill that
champagne!
Larry

The prior notice blanket was a possibility, but with the change in diameters 
it most likely won't work.  I agree with you a 7 (c) filing would be 
required.  I noticed they are discussing environmental information below, but 
what is the status of preparing the reports?  If we are to make the filing, 
we need a meeting to make sure that everyone is gathering the proper 
information.  In some of our other filings we conducted town hall meetings 
prior to survey work to gain support of the people.  This should be being.  

A question I have is "will the mainline need to be expanded?"  How do they 
plan to serve the load from a fully subscribed pipe? (I believe it is fully 
subscribed)

Thanks 
Keith

   
	
	

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?  
Any comments?

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.  

Lindy, do you know offhand whether our OBAs with PG&E and SoCal deviate from 
the usual 10% tolerance provided for in our tariff form OBA?  If not, who do 
you think might be able to tell me?  

This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to 
spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be 
able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who 
should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia 
Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this 
is something HR is not capable of taking care of.

David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective 
August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In 
addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.

Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do 
not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval 
authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  
The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the 
company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later 
that the agreement is not valid.

Does it have to be an officer of the company (West Penetone, NiGen 
International) that signs the agreement?
Or is it ok for the sales rep to sign it?

Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite 
and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor 
this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call 
this afternoon.
Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so 
the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd 
last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already 
celebrated appropriately!
What do you think of my Destin idea?
talk to you soon
Love,
Sooz

Matt, here are redlined and clean versions.  Let me know whether the 
revisions are acceptable.

Thanks,
Susan

As you requested.
	
	

Please take a look at this and give me a call.  I didn't know we were 
expecting any agreement from ECS.  DF

How does this draft look to you guys?

Mark
Comments?

Here is the agreement with the changes you requested.

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

You have just received the "Aggie Virus"!!!

Since Aggies arn't very smart and don't have any programming
experience, this Virus works on the honor system.

Please delete all the files on your hard drive,
and manually forward this Virus to everyone on your
mailing list.

I do not see any problems with this.

Bob Chandler and I request some changes inorder to detail the upfront 
payment.  If you do not have any problems with the document, please advise 
and we will notify Gerald to create executables.

Thanks,

08/01/2000 09:25 AM
Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will 
create executables.  Thanks.

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

S.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE 
INTERACTIVE OPEN SEASON APPROVAL

Please review the attached announcement of Transwestern's Interactive Open 
Season to be held Thursday, August 10, 2000.  Transwestern will be offering 
14,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau to PG&E/Topock capacity for a term of April 
1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  Alternate capacity rights associated with the 
primary capacity shall include alternate receipts in Transwestern's East of 
Thoreau Area, excluding Rio Puerco, and alternate deliveries at 
SoCal/Needles, Mojave/Topock and the Citizens Griffith delivery point . 

Please approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Your immediate attention is 
appreciated as our goal is to post the announcement as quickly as possible in 
the morning of Friday, August 4th.

Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and 
my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue 
after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.

12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:

Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to 
provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an 
interruptible basis.

Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.

Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).

The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.

2/18/93 letter amendment:

Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 
200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and 
quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide 
firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.

9/25/95 letter amendment:

Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San 
Juan expansion is effective.

My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 
250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure 
requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if 
accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can 
argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation 
because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force 
majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to 
have gotten hotter over the years.  

The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in 
January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say 
we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an 
absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive 
system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the 
agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.

 In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for 
project development:

Retainer:  $1000/month plus expenses
Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000
Each month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project)
Letter of Intent:  $5000
Signed Agreement:  $10,000
 Incentive Fee:  To be determined

 When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on 
reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In 
his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) 
and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- 
$3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure 
only. 

 The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a 
one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, 
and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and 
third party "identified by IGS under this agreement."  As you know, the 
"identified by" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the 
Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW 
Commercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to 
Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in 
ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any 
future consulting agreement.

 Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides 
for payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the 
"identified by" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and 
until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.

 I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling 
agreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him 
according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the 
specific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a 
short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the 
agreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; 
we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment 
for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent 
are of little value to Transwestern.

  Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to 
proceed.

From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present 
brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern 
desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so 
notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the 
following terms and conditions:

1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project 
development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, 
market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically 
authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of 
Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written 
proposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other 
project-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the 
retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the 
counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to 
terminate the project.  

2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal 
(or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay 
IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the 
project].  "Accepting the project" means that the project meets 
Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern 
Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the 
project to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this 
paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to 
completion.

3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the 
project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate 
an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset 
of the project).

(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."  At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues.

Susan,
As requested in yesterday's meeting, Lindy and I came up with the attached 
matrix of prices for purposes of valuing TW imbalances.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and 
legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the 
meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the 
marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed 
Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate 
concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits 
on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run 
into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly 
favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do 
deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's 
price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the 
affiliates, by using "funny money," can always make themselves the highest 
bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + 
affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing 
affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between 
the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The 
presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able 
to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal 
would encourage affiliates to pay "real" dollars.  

While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing 
affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation 
on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other 
pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our 
filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the 
precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a 
divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can 
avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with 
affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and 
our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't 
believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to 
unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to 
do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments 
or a limited protest addressing the issue.

The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal 
as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're 
proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always 
be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this 
is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it 
before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of 
curiosity rather than a basis for protest.

Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer 
meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group 
are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.

I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned 
in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities 
of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect 
in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as 
soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.  

The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, 
modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 
250,000 MMBtu.  

//
Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up 
conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday 
and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month 
in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and 
Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not 
been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info 
together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 
190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately 
reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not 
accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically "best efforts" 
and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so we will need to revise this 
further.

We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate 
delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but 
they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect 
agreement.  They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on 
their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06).  

The ball is in our court.  

John, I think that sounds fine.
I really have no other comments on the org chart or job descriptions.
Thanks so much for your help!

I just met with Steve Harris to review the Transwestern Commercial Group job 
descriptions and proposed organization chart.  He agreed with the wording of 
the job descriptions but suggested that the TW employees currently working in 
NNG's Business Development and Marketing organization be shown on the 
Transwestern organization chart in a dotted line reporting relationship to 
him.  A footnote would identify them as 

"Transwestern employees located in the NNG Business Development & Marketing 
organization which serves as a resource to support the TW Commercial Group in 
the areas of Risk Management, Pricing & Structuring, Business Development, 
Market Analysis and Government Affairs"

Steve also indicated that a TW employee will also be hired in the next few 
days to fill a Regional Mgr Government Affairs job currently located in Mike 
McGowen's group and that this job should also be placed in a dotted line 
relationship reporting to him.  The existing footnote could be revised to 
recognize this job as well. 

After talking to Steve I feel that the above would be the best and least 
confusing way to portray Transwestern employees in an on-line organization 
chart.  In this regard I have again revised the Transwestern Commercial 
organization chart and will deliver/fax it this afternoon to you both for 
your review and comments.

The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th 
- 29th.  See the website www.spahouston.org and click on "Program Notes" for 
a detailed description.  

Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage.  
I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy 
going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but 
it should not be a problem if we go early enough.  

The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird!  
Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.

We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!  Have a good day!  

First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!

I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior 
notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental 
requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an 
"eligible facility" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to 
provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and 
according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the 
Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.  
The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec. 
157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek 
a 7(c) certificate.  

I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able 
to find out:

In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing 
Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to 
construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the 
lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was 
not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be 
willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 
284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4 
filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the 
lateral. 

Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or 
not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to 
implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau 
rates.

As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if 
Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However, 
if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll 
probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c) 
application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it 
would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.

At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for 
the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project 
and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.

I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not 
sound right to you let me know.

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is "NO".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Somehow the "one-part rate" glossary item fell off of TW's list so I've 
revised it again.

I owe Michele a call because she has a couple of questions.  Will do after I 
finish options draft.  

   
	
	

Have you guys met/discussed this with Michele?  Please get me up to speed.  
Thanks DF

Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise 
access to my Lotus Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.

Merci beaucoup!

Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.

1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the 
following cast of characters:

Steve Harris
Kevin Hyatt
Lindy Donoho
Jeff Fawcett
TK Lohman
Christine Stokes
Michelle Lokay
Lorraine Lindberg

When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone 
to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize 
meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey 
Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her 
(x35849).

2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about 
when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in 
early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice.

3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:

- TW Options (a tariff filing)
- Order 637 compliance
- Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)

4.  Standing meetings:

- TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30
- Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15.
- Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; 
but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)

5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call 
first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 
47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).

6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.

7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.  
However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a 
ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty 
important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more 
important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever 
go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in 
the right folder is enough.

8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new 
Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 
3rdqtr00, etc.)

9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get 
e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the 
calendar. 

10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother 
("Ms. Savoy"), Dianna

11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I 
get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure 
of her location as it seems to change a lot.

I look forward very much to working with you!!

Not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the Options filing in case 
you need it.

Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly 
"looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know 
you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:

Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of 
Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these 
draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a 
good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to 
filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees 
only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your 
company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in 
final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management 
approval prior to filing with the Commission.

Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account 
information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual 
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual 
here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval 
as soon as possible.

Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if 
possible.  Thank you.

The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the 
marketing fee.  The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement 
(i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the 
attached instead.  Questions or comments -- let me know.

   
	
	

I've talked to Drew and he can report back-  MK

Starting on January 6, 2000 there will be a Gallup status conference 
call/meeting every Thursday through May.  The Conference Bridge number is 
713-853-3802 and the access code is 9473 (same as before).  When using the 
1-800-97ENRON, simply press 1 for the building code then the ext 33802.  Wait 
for the beep and enter the access code (9473).  For those in Houston, 
Conference Room EB40C2 will be available.  They're a limited number of ports 
so please try to group together as much as possible.  This is becoming a 
critical period for Gallup and we must share information as soon as it's 
known.  Please don't wait for the "THURSDAY" meeting if any information is 
critical to the success of Gallup.

If I have left anyone off the list who should know this information, please 
pass this along and copy me so I'll know the next time.

Thank You

Lorraine, here is the new language for the discount letter.  You might want 
to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to 
make sure I got the right version (or I'll do it on Monday).  Let me know if 
you have questions.  I just ran it by Drew and he is OK with it.

Jeff -- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could 
use your help on that part of the discussion.

***
Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  
Here is a summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA 
buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out 
of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to 
Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned 
from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to 
credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing 
will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they 
want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated 
its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the 
difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest 
bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a 
certain percentage.  

Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing 
affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption 
that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of 
capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to 
voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others 
have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those 
issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all 
interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a 
negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not 
respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point 
is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals 
will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum 
rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options 
program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not 
clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for 
hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply 
make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to 
placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may 
purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their 
comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

FYI.

Robert, in response to your question, I don't know who the El Paso tax 
contact is, but I'll find out & let you know.  Thanks again.

Christine, the "actual fuel usage" provision is probably a material deviation 
from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated 
in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect.

If we're using the "actual fuel" language because we anticipate that the fuel 
usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the 
percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out 
and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would 
generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know.

Let me know if you have any revisions to the provided discount letter.

Note that this contract will only charge ACTUAL FUEL utilized if the Shipper 
transports along the primary path (Paragraph 2).  Also, Kevin - is $.09 a 
sufficient TOTAL RATE for alternate deliveries to the California Border?  I 
think by fixing the rate like this we are leaving a lot of money behind.  We 
could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to 
California will be set by Transwestern.  We have, a long time ago, used this 
language and it forces the shipper to call TK for the appropriate montly rate 
quote.  If fact, Richardson Products has this arrangement.   Let me know your 
thoughts.

Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's "negotiated".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.

How about tomorrow?
I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format, by the way.  Should make getting 
a draft out easier.  Here it is if you want to take a look.

Hey gals - Could we get together for about 30 minutes this week to put 
together an OBA for Southwest Gas?  I've asked Larry Black (SWG) to review 
the draft which we filed in our 637 compliance filing and we need to address 
a couple of issues specific to SWG.  Then, we'll have to go to Las Vegas to 
wrap up all the details, of course.

How about discussing this over lunch anytime this week?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Lorraine

I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the 
circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.  I 
really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality 
obligations.  I need to get Drew's clearance for Colorado law; I'll get back 
to you.

Gerald Nemec@ECT

Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss 
the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts.

Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

Thanks,

Dave Nocera  

Christine, I made a few changes for purposes of clarification.

Christine Stokes
09/12/2000 09:45 AM
Here it is.

I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Christine and Bob and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.

CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Duke Energy 
Trading & Marketing (DUKE) and the associated letter from Transwestern to 
Duke which outlines the conditions of Transwestern's Contribution in Aid of 
Construction (CIAC) payment to Duke for certain facility upgrades.

Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to 
increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big 
Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.  Duke shall 
subsequently subscribe to a five year transportation contract for 20,000 
Dth/d of East of Thoreau  (EOT) capacity at a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate 
effective November 1, 2000.  Duke shall be charged ACTUAL fuel, currently 
calculated as 1.5% (compared to EOT Tariff fuel rate of 1.31%), for any 
transportation within Transwestern's EOT Area.  Duke has also been granted 
the ability to flow to California on an alternate basis at a total rate of 
$.09/Dth/d plus applicable Tariff fuel (currently 5%).

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Please contact me at x5702 
if any questions arise.

Thanks Robert, this is a big help.
Just wondering -- you make the statement that "El Paso is not directing TW to 
build the interconnect facilities..."  Do you think that our having an 
interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and 
setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of 
saying this is not a CIAC?  

Robert Guthrie
09/13/2000 08:05 AM
I can only address this from the tax position.  Books may differ from the 
noted treatment depending on the true facts.  I have a call to James Centilli 
for his thoughts.  I also have not reviewed any written language, so this is 
based on our conversations; therefore the facts may change depending on the 
final arrangement.

Based on my understanding, the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to 
TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities.  Because El 
Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not 
record these fees as a CIAC for tax.  In short, the management fee is just 
normal operational type revenue.  The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid 
the gross-up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS 
Code Section 118 (b).  However, please note that the management fee is still 
taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received.   It is just 
not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes.  

The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built 
should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW 
and not contributed from El Paso -- I have a call to James Centilli to 
confirm.

Clarification on CIAC ( IRC 118(b)).  This is a code section that governs for 
tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for 
services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes.  For tax,  
the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received, and 
the asset is depreciated, normally 15 years, MACRS.  The Gross-up paid is the 
time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer 
requesting the service.  

The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for 
tax.  For tax, the money is received and taxed.  The money is then used 
indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 
years, MACRS for tax.  The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross-up 
of approximately $50,000.  The $50,000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing 
the deal with El Paso.  The lost cost should be off-set in part from rate 
recovery.  I don't know how this piece will work -- James Centilli should be 
able to confirm.

Let me know if we need to discuss further.  I am out of the office after 
12:30 today to return on Monday.  I will check my voice mail.  However, If 
you need to move on this or need additional help,  please call me on my 
mobile number (832) 647-4610.

   

Robert, here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum 
explaining what we're doing with El Paso.  Can you elaborate on the "meter 
fee" approach?  

I'm not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC, and why we 
get to include it in the rate base.  

If you can add to this I would appreciate it, or just give me a call and we 
can discuss it further.  Thanks so much for your help.

***

El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities.  Estimated 
cost:  $280,000.  EPFS will contribute $165,000 pursuant to an interconnect 
agreement.  The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross-up 
associated with a contribution in aid of construction.  The Internal Revenue 
Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other 
contributions made by a customer or potential customer (collectively, 
"CIACs") are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from 
gross income.  Accordingly, such amounts are required to be included in gross 
income.  

EPFS has proposed, instead of the $165,000 being paid in a lump sum, that the 
contribution instead be paid in equal monthly installments as a "meter fee."  
Our tax department has advised me that while this approach does not absolve 
TW from tax liability on that revenue, it does have a couple of advantages.  
It would remove the contribution from the CIAC category (why is it not a 
CIAC?)and TW would be allowed to include it in its rate base.  Additionally, 
TW would be allowed to treat the interconnect facilities as a depreciable 
asset.  

OK, here's my first attempt.  Although I think Red Cedar's lawyers might be 
looking for more, they have not specifically requested it, so I decided to 
stick to making only the statements Ed Meaders mentioned in his 2 voice 
mails.  I believe this may suffice.

Attached for your review and comment are the draft changes to the 
Comprehensive Settlement due to the withdrawal of Altra.? Thanks.

Hi Mum!  What an eventful few days it has been.  Sorry I didn't call over the 
weekend.  I had my hands full painting my bedroom!  It took forever!  Luckily 
I got the color right on the first try:  the Happy Yellow looks pretty good.  
Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis 
tournament, which was fun.  It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the 
theater/art group I've been interested in joining.  In fact, yesterday I got 
a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in 
board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!  I'm really 
excited and am expecting good news.  This could be an auspicious start to 
life after law for me!
Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.  It went by too quickly!  I hope you're 
having a good week; let me hear from you!
Love,
Sooz.

Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you 
have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty 
old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures 
marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!  The 
handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and 
bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the 
A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've noticed that 
needs fixing let me know.

Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very 
much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom!  
Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to 
go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice 
before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just 
because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll 
check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with 
you.

Susan,

Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be
fixed!)

Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has
some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets.

I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, 
however
I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 
100%
sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would
probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, 
which
I am considering as there is no real reason to rush).

If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have
nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very
hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful
people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give 
you
notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant!

I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated!

OK to you and the 1/2 reimbursement arrangement is OK with EPFS, please 
forward to James Centilli for his review.  Thanks.

Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting 
practices and they agreed to do the Christine/Susan/dealmaker huddle prior to 
sending any contracts out.  It helps that I have Kevin's support on this.  I 
think it will work fine.

TK is going make sure Tenaska gets credited.  The difference between actual 
and billed amounts is very little.

Thanks for your attention to this last week.

Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know.  
Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying 
in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since 
you live so close to the airport!

Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend 
before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as 
it did.

You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to 
live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there 
could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.

Mary Kay -- please see the attached -- Red Cedar has essentially asked us for 
acknowledgement that TW is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport 
gas for producers even though Red Cedar itself does not have title to the 
gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.  

Kevin, let me know if you have any questions...

Attached is summary of protestor comments to TW's Order 637 compliance 
filing.  It will be attached to the Weekly Report as well.

Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make "operational" sales 
of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting 
from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain 
linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine.  
By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect 
as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Lindy Donoho
09/20/2000 04:43 PM
In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to 
reduce it.  Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk 
for the gas price.  It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense.  
TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.  Should 
TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?  Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel 
expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.  This 
summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging 
$3.4-3.8MM a month.  Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but 
not the price.
  
How could we hedge our fuel used?  Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge 
it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its 
own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?  Could we have hedged 
some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we 
hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing 
this summer?

Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more 
effectively?

Susan,
I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back 
(when we were looking at fuel monetization).  What did the FERC Order say 
about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?

You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief 
explanation.

Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third 
party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with 
eliminating "stockholders" and the "...judgments of any nature..." clause you 
two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs 
a. and b.

Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS 
against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.  
TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate 
the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT 
standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with 
these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in 
case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached 
to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and 
DOT standards.
(By the way, I believe the "notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the 
contrary" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)

Any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596).

Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request 
that we provide "something in writing."  This is basically just a description 
of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not 
reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information 
to raise a lot of questions.

Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to 
the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the 
opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  

Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to 
provide something to them tomorrow.

Hi Mum -- not going to DC until next week.
Any ideas for Karin's birthday?  Maybe we could look for something this 
weekend.
I plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as I can!
Going to Brennan's tonight w/Craig.
Dianna isn't coming with me to Austin so I guess I will just come first thing 
Sat. a.m.  I'll give you a call tomorrow!

Camp2scott@aol.com on 09/28/2000 03:22:07 PM
Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum

Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I 
could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as "firm" or "interruptible" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.  

Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.

Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.

Drew, here is the memo.  I know you will add your own spin before sending it 
on to Cordes.  However, if there is anything you want me to fix, please do 
not hesitate to call.

 

Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the 
"negligence" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated 
out in the first place).  So it would read:

4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, 
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and 
servants, contractors and subcontractors ("Indemnified Party" or "Indemnified 
Parties") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, 
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal 
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its 
agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms 
of this Agreement.

b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and 
its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, 
losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits 
for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable 
attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of 
EPFS or its agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations 
under the terms of this Agreement.

c.  [same as current version]
d. [same as current version]

Susan-
See what you think of using the following in Section 4.2 and deleting
Section 4.3 in its entirety and replacing it with the below:

Section 4.2
  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EPFS,
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, agents and
servants, contractors and subcontractors ("Indemnified Party" or
"Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.
  b.   EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TW
and its Indemnified from and against any and all liabilities, claims,
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's
fees and expenses) in any way directly or indirectly arising out of or in
connection with TW's performance of its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 4.3
In no event shall either party be responsible for the gross negligence or
wilfull misconduct of the other party or their Indemnified Parties.

Maria reminded me that we are required to file a rate case to be effective 
Nov. 1, 2006.
We could file one before then as to non-Current Firm Shippers, but I doubt we 
will.
Any other questions -- let me know.

I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a 
FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully 
subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with 
previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity 
at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule 
capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into 
SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced 
daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.

If you would like a copy of the complaint, let me know.

given that I don't even know what UAF is, I will plan to attend.

   
	
	

Yes and Yes.  I'd like our Houston lawyers to attend the Houston presentation 
and if you can do one up here, I'd like our Omaha lawyers to attend also.  
Thanks.  DF  

   
	
	

For the past two months I have been visiting the GPG Operations Regional 
offices giving a presentation on physical "UAF Fundamentals and Issues" .

The presentation has been very well received.  Interest is high, and numerous 
questions have been raised at each meeting.  The presentation can be given in 
50 minutes if questions are limited.  It has taken up to 3 hours due to the 
amount of questions from the attendees. 

One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better 
understanding of the impact  UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact 
it has on our shipper costs (NNG). 

Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the 
financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.  Coming out of that meeting was a 
request to schedule a Houston presentation on "UAF Fundamentals".  This has 
been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

Two Questions:

Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Omaha?????
Do you have any staff in Houston that you would like  to invite to the 10/18 
presentation????

Copy of the presentation if you are interested:     

Thanks  Steve  37885

Darin, that is fine.  Revised agreement attached.

Susan,

I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before
execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph
3.4

This is how I would like to see it read,

3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are
completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to
 deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect
Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date
 the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not
met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund
 $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two
(2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW
 at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS
is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation
 to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as
originally writen...

Please let me know what you think.

Darin

In response to your question of whether Transwestern Pipeline needs to renew 
its bond (Bond No. 22000455) to the State of Oklahoma, the answer is yes.

If you have any questions, please call me at x30596.

Take a look at the attached and let's talk tomorrow if at all possible.  I 
want us to have a consensus among ourselves on this draft before I circulate 
it more widely.

I neglected to include some of Drew's comments in the version I sent you a

The attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with 
FERC staff.  You will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets 
separately.

Please make sure you read the "Waivers" section towards the end of the 
document as it contains some additional requests for waivers.

Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all 
options, not just Shipper call options.  My previous drafts have provided for 
posting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be 
generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My 
thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of 
all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on 
our transaction reports required by Order 637.  Let me know what you think.

Let me know your comments as soon as possible.  I understand that the 
Commercial Group told Stan Horton this would be filed this week and Shelley 
reported at staff meeting on Monday that it would be filed this week or next 
week.  As soon as I get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.

Thank you.

Mark, Jeff Fawcett asked me to forward the attached documents to you.  One is 
an interconnect agreement and one is an operating agreement.  I would 
describe both as "examples" rather than "forms," since every deal is 
different and we don't really have a standard form we use.  I hope that these 
are helpful; if you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to 
contact me.

I left him an extremely short voice mail thanking him for the book and asking 
him not to contact me again unless his message is kind and positive.  I tried 
to make my tone very pleasant and calm.

On Ann's and your advice, I'm going to rescue the shredded letter/envelope 
out of the trash; be careful what you toss in there.

Jay and Dan:

This is the first draft of a filing Transwestern is considering filing with
FERC on Monday, October 16, 2000.  Susan Scott will be finalizing this
document on Friday, October 13, 2000.  I will be out of town and unavailable
to review it so she asked if you would look it over here (and as revised on
Friday) to be sure they do not say anything in the filing that is not true
or mischaracterized.  If you have any other suggestions, Susan's phone
number is below.  Again, they are still considering whether or not they will
make this filing.

Susan:

I understand that Jay Golub, too, is traveling this week but is able to view
and respond to his email.  His email address is jgolub@bakerbotts.com
<mailto:jgolub@bakerbotts.com> .  I am also forwarding this to Dan McFearin,
Manager of Transportation Services.  Dan's email address is dmcfear@pnm.com
<mailto:dmcfear@pnm.com>  and Dan's phone number is (505) 241-2496.  If you
do not hear from Jay, you can check with Dan.

I have made changes to the document.  I think the document refers to "peak"
period when it means to refer to "non-peak" period in the first paragraph of
the Argument and vice versa in the second paragraph.  You may have caught
these by now.  I will be in on Monday after all so if you need to talk to
me, you can call me on Monday.

Thanks,

That is correct, I returned comments to Accounting, not AA directly.
I don't think I sent my comments to Drew, but I don't remember very clearly.

Tony Jackson
10/13/2000 03:21 PM
Susan,

That is pretty much all we needed for now Susan.  I appreciate your offer of 
the comments, but I will get back to you later if it looks like we need to 
see those.  

You mentioned you sent comments to someone at AA.  I assume you mean the 
comments were returned to the NNG and TW accounting folks instead (where 
Allen is).  Also, do you send your comments to Drew as well.  

Thanks for the quick response.

Tony

I reviewed the 1999 Form 2 for Transwestern and sent some comments to someone 
at AA (I apologize, I don't remember who, but I think it might have been 
Allen Joe).
If you need to see my comments, I believe I kept a hard copy in my file.

I also reviewed the 1998 Form 2 for Transwestern.

If you need further information, please let me know.

Tony Jackson
10/13/2000 02:36 PM
Maria/Susan,

My name is Tony Jackson with Arthur Andersen, and I am the experienced staff 
on the Enron Transportation Services (with a focus on NNG and TW) audit 
team.  Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews 
related to various risk areas. 

We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal 
contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.  One of 
the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal 
and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.  Harry 
Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal "sign-off" or 
approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were 
sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.  Your 
names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal 
to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW).   

In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that 
this type of review was performed for the 1999 NNG and TW Form No. 2s.  What 
role did you and your group play in this review?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your time.

Tony - AA

Attached is the cover letter.  This version incorporates the changes we 
discussed over the phone on Friday, Stojic & Kelly's suggestions, and further 
revisions by Shelley.  (I've attached redlined and nonredlined versions.)  
Shelley and I might have a further revision or two with respect to footnote 
9.  

On Monday I'll be in meetings 9:30 - 10:30 and 2:00 - 4:00; otherwise I'll be 
at my desk.  Please fax me the final version of the tariff sheets when you 
have them (to 713-646-4095).  And, please call if there are any remaining

Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline 
project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from 
ARCO.  Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder 
would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.  The pipeline 
system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.  The East Zone, 
which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will 
have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.  The West Zone, wholly within 
California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.  

Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July 
28,2000.  An optional certificate application does not require any showing of 
market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to 
Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of 
demand.  The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the 
capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with 
its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East 
Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service 
agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are "being negotiated" with prospective 
shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in 
both the East and West zones.  

TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has 
been filed.  I have no further information about any further subscription of 
capacity.  I also have no information regarding any progress that has been 
made on construction.
If you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC, 
or if you have any other questions, please let me know and I'll see what I 
can find.  I've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need 
that for any reason!

Chad -- Good to see you the other day.  Please give me a call when you return 
to your office.  I am embarrassed to say that I am not sure I have the right 
version of the Operating Agreement we sent you in March...if we can compare 
notes, I can make sure I get the correct one to you without further delay.

Thank you!

Colleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.  I 
definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.
Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already 
included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does 
find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very 
interested in seeing your suggested language too.

Please send your attachment "CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".

Again, thank you so much for your help with this.  (Calpine has finally woken 
up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...)
I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.

Colleen Raker
10/18/2000 07:35 PM
Attached below is Jeff Fawsett's  3/22/00 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/00 
draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Calpine require 
to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is 
substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A 
and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine.

 From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to 
Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to 
Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&M 
Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 
3/20/00 draft for TW management's consideration.  These changes are noted in 
the attached document marked "CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".  
With my 10-18-00 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for 
loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or 
damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused 
by TW's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section 
5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it 
is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount 
of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser 
amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured 
for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk 
that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its 
existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?  That is the amount to 
insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.  

FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of 
Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.  
I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and 
redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know 
the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of 
TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in 
Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the 
final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.

Jeffery Fawcett
03/22/2000 12:26 PM
Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit "A" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.

Ashley, here's an ad in Word format.  If Deron could post it at Hewitt, I 
would be most grateful!

I just received word that I'm losing my garage apt. renter as of Nov. 30...  
If any of you know someone who is looking for a place, have them call me!!  
(I found my current renter through a friend and it has worked out great.)
Here are the specifics:

2 bedroom/1 bath garage apartment in Houston Heights (Cortlandt St.).  
Hardwood floors,  lots of windows, new window A/C units, washer/dryer hookup, 
garage parking space.  Cats OK.  $650/month.  Available December 1.  Call 
713-853-0596 (day) or 713-864-4960 (evening).

Thanks!

Chad, attached is the draft of the Measurement and Control Facilities 
Operating Agreement for Calpine's review.  As we discussed, because the 
exhibits are still being finalized, I have not included them in this draft.  
If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you.

Unfortunately I can't go to Austin next weekend; I've planned to go to L.A. 
to visit Sue.  I am bringing my new beau with me!  You will meet Craig at 
some point.  I think it's also safe to say you will like him much better than 
Bill.
I'm tentatively planning to come to Austin the weekend of Nov. 11, but you 
know that is totally up to D.E. (Dreamy Eric).
In the meantime, send Bug photos if possible!

Hola and happy Friday! Just a note to let you know that we will be going to
Austin next weekend for wig control.  Might you be able to join us there?
Jim left this morning with Dave to go to Zion.  It will be a good male
bonding kind of trip I guess.  Dave and Sandy (excuse me, David and
Sandra...)are expecting a baby in December so it will kind of be a "last
hurrah" for him, I guess! Anyway, mum is going to help me with bug duty this
weekend for which I am most thankful.  Now I can get at least be assured of
getting the routine cleaning done.  Well, let me know if you can make it to
Austin next weekend, otay?

copied and sent to me.   I think I would remember what the document looks

I am planning to be out Friday, Oct. 27 and Monday, Oct. 30.  

I see no reason to acknowledge your presence given the way you are harassing

Please do not attempt to contact me again.

Susan:  I would appreciate it if you would at least treat me civilly (such 
as, acknowledge my existence) when we encounter eachother in public, like at 
the Met for example.  I ask you to remember that I did not start this 
situation, but I was forced to deal with it.  I just responded to the 
unprovoked things that you did and said to me -- the likes of which I had 
never before experienced.  Pls keep that in mind.

It has been quite some time since you said you were going to return those 
items I brought you from Hong Kong.  I previously told you that I felt it was 
the right thing to do under the circumstances.  Given what has happened and 
what those items represent, I do not see how you could now feel it is 
appropriate to keep them or how you could possibly derive any enjoyment from 
them.  Pls let me know what you intend to do, and we can make appropriate 
arrangements.  Thanks.

Bill  

Let me know what you think.

Here's the letter with some slight changes.  
Drew and I thought it better to mention the interconnect for regulatory 
reasons.  Questions? let's chat.
Thanks.

Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.

Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest.

Mike, as we discussed yesterday, please get a copy of the following exhibits 
to the "Happy Trails" application in Docket No. CP99-163-000:

Exhibit K - Cost of facilities

Susan,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in 
Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,
Jeff Nguyen

Sugarbooger,

Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.  American is 
slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!  Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose 
is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
COB tomorrow.

Muchos besos!
S.

Attached is a draft of an answer to protests received in Docket No. RP01-56.  
Please let me know your comments before noon tomorrow if possible.  Thanks.

Please print out the attached on my letterhead & bring it over to me.  Thank 
you!!

Here it is.

Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.  Let me know if 
you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.

 Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a 
request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding 
of Shipper call options.  The procedure will be as follows:  an advance 
posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation 
service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.  Shipper call 
options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option 
component.  

Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read 
thru...if you have further comments let me know immediately.  Thanks.

done.

   
	
	

Great--please make one change for me--change  "influence it" to "comment on 
it"  at the end of the first par. of B.  thanks DF

The Star Diva has spoken!  I believe she is correct in everything but the

would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot imagine

Here it is.  It also includes Naomi's name/address.

Here is a very rough draft -- an outline, really -- of an answer to Indicated 
Shippers' protest.

Please provide comments as you see fit.  I will probably not have time to 
look at them until later in the afternoon tomorrow, at which time I will also 
do a lot more writing (i.e., making complete sentences, transitions, heading, 
conclusion, etc.).  In other words, of greatest interest to me right now are 
your ideas on the best way to rebut the Shippers' arguments (including 
identifying those that might be safe to ignore). 

Thank you!

Denise, please put these meetings on my calendar.  Thanks.

Hello Dave.
 
My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting, 
but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.  

Best regards,
Susan

Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses?  If so, I have a
question....

Do you happen to know if there are FERC rules requiring interstate pipelines
(are you familiar with any?) to offer e-contracting (including e-signature)
to customers/shippers, or is it a discretionary service...... or not a
service at all?

Of course, I need to do my own legal research, but maybe you two know off
the top of your head.

Thanks, and cheers...

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.

Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 
(about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that 
language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be 
helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.  However, if it's 
inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them 
notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.

Please take a look at the draft and let me know if you have comments today.  
Still working on justifying transporter options, as you can see on page 5.  

If possible I'd like to send it to Nancy to file today.

Thanks,

Nancy and Mike, please sign the attached and file it today, and deliver 
copies to those staff members who got copies of our initial filing.  Please 
fax a signed copy to Denise LaGesse at 713-853-5425 and she'll do the service

11 to 1 but will take a break to check messages).

Glen, as we discussed, here is the negotiated rate TW deal which TK did today 
under Rate Schedule ITS-1.
The term is ONE DAY, Nov. 15. 
Quantity:  30,000 Dth/day

I know this is a bit unusual.  We are just going to have to ask the FERC for 
a waiver of their "before gas flows" filing requirement.
Given the price spreads and the shippers' willingness to pay more than max. 
rates for short-term deals, we might have more deals like this.  We probably 
need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when 
this happens.  It would be so much better if we were able to send tariff 
sheets via e-mail to our D.C. office.

Call if you have questions or need anything.
	
	

Susan, I did a negotiated rate with PG&E Energy Trading for transport from 
the EOT Area to WOT area at $0.09 for November 15, 2000.  Their contract # is 
8265.

I don't know if it will flow yet.  TW is allocated for tomorrow.

p.s. the tariff sheet we need to file is 5B.05.

Mary, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy 
Statement and found the following language:

"A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated 
rate at the time it intends the rate to
   go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the 
effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or
   impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the 
Commission will readily grant requests to
   waive the 30 day notice requirement."

I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to 
file on the same day.  This reinforces my belief that 
our waiver language is fine as is.

Janet, can you open the attachment?
	
	

	
	

The Gallup order did issue today and is available on CIPs.  I am attaching it.

Mike will be getting the order today (he is at FERC now ) and will fax a copy.

Ted -- see minor changes on the attached.
Try to get them to agree to Texas law.  (Might help to point out that our 
interconnect agreement with Calpine as well as any transport agreement will 
be governed by Texas law.)

On November 2, 2000, the California PUC issued an Order Instituting 
Investigation into the adequacy of Sempra's, SoCal's and SDG&E's planning of 
SoCal's and SDG&E's gas transmission system and what measures should be taken 
to correct any deficiencies.  The parties have been ordered to appear and 
show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating 
that:

 - SDG&E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter 
heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year.  If such 
supply is not adequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate 
supply.

 - SDG&E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need 
for gas-fired electric generation.  If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for 
obtaining adequate supply.

 - SDG&E's  gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by 
interests of its corporate affiliates.

 - Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting 
supply for SDG&E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with 
representations to the Commission.

 - SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not, 
SDG&E shall propose changes.

 A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November 
22.  Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the 
response is filed.

 The Commission also ordered SDG&E to evaluate whether an interim, 
interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers 
voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter.  If so, 
SDG&E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration.

 The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by 
SDG&E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily 
revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric 
generation customers.  The Advice Letter was heavily protested and was 
withdrawn by SDG&E.

 In my conversation with Mark Baldwin regarding our pending consulting 
agreement for monitoring California regulatory matters for Transwestern, I 
asked him to watch for Sempra's Nov. 22 filing and to advise whether he 
believes Transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is 
to be scheduled.  I will follow up with Mark, and provide you with a copy of 
the filing.
 

Hi Maria Victoria!  I'm planning to be there right at 12.  At the entrance 
they usually have a table where you pick up your name tag; we can meet there 
if you like.  See you soon!

Hello!!!
Hope things went really well for you last week/end.  I wanted to check if you 
will be attending the CLE presentation today so that we can arrange to meet 
there.

From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures 
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around 
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more 
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and 
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute 
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic 
Sag 
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two 
are 
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known 
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with 
their 
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing 
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable 
and 
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the 
Archer's 
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. 

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word 
here; 
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over 
exciting 
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as 
such 
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very 
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd. 

First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

Drew Fossum
11/19/2000 06:32 PM
Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat 
about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you 
know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an 
LFT deal.  DF 

Mary Kay Miller
11/19/2000 07:39 AM
We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK

 What a nice surprise seeing you the other evening in Houston. You look

matters and client development. It would be great to catch-up with you and 
take you to lunch or to have a cocktail sometime soon. I'm in Houston on

me know.

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail

Bryan, 

Are you still having a great time?  So what is Bali like?  The only images I 
can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?  

Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas 
cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, 
though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.  

Take care.

S.

I just rely on the market services folks to do the right thing.  Tell me if 
you think this is yet another area in which I have too much faith in our 
business people.

these affiliates commences or ceases involvment in a transportation 
transaction on your pipeline, the company name and address must be 
respectively added or deleted from the posting on your pipeline's web site 
WITHIN THREE DAYS.  This listing will be revised and sent to you immediately 
when there is a change in the list.

Finally, note that affiliated companies which are exempt from being 
classified as marketing affiliates are included at the end of the list.  If 
any of these companies proposes to transport on your respective Enron 
pipeline, please check with your Legal Contact to make sure the exemption is 
still in effect.

Individuals listed on the Distribution List of the attached memo 
are requested to acknowledge receipt.

Couple of minor changes.  Looking good!

I took all of your good suggestions and incorporated them.  I also reordered 
a few of the paragraphs and trimmed some of the language.  Look at it again 
and see if we've got a pretty good work product.  Thanks!!!

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it 
directly to Drew and Maria.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about 
corporate etiquette?  I wonder.
On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond 
the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.  

Jeffery Fawcett
11/22/2000 08:22 AM
Now do you see why I didn't want to send this to Keith Petersen???  Anytime 
you send anything to Omaha, the MKM cult goes into their Satan worship 
chamber, they sing a few chants, and then sacrifice the good commercial 
effort to the demon regulatory god.  

Jeez, next time I'm gonna just send it out to the customer and ask for 
forgiveness later.

	
	

Jeff,  do you have the information for the rate?  We would have to file a 
certificate and the rate would need to be calculated in accordance with the 
standard COS methodology-  I want to make sure that the rate you are planning 
to quote matches what the rate derivation for the filing would be-  avoid a 
potential issue-  maybe James could send us what he did- thanks  MK

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

   
	
	

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF    

Susan Scott
11/21/2000 10:08 AM
I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

   
	
	

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    

For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC 
adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated 
restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not 
so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.  
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of 
the competing settlements.  
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have 
questions.
S.
Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

Best,
Jeff

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes 
effective Dec. 1.  (Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks 
ago).  The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy.  
The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR 
under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation.
The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract 
provision is described.
Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance).
I have a conf. call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want 
to give me a call.

Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power."  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks. 

 

Lindy -- FYI.  This is just really informal so I'd prefer you not forward to 
anyone yet.  Drew and Maria are most familiar with this so I'm going to get 
their feedback first before setting up a meeting.  I'll get with you before I 
set a meeting time to see when you're available.

Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.   

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Does lunch on Monday, December 4th work for
your schedules?  If not, let's hear a counter-offer.

Susan,

I go this email as well.  Unfortunately, I've been busy as well and didn't
really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can
understand our roles/duties/functions a little better (hey, aren't we both
pretty big clients of a certain Houston law firm? -- hint, hint, Charles  :

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Hi Ashley!  A couple of things.  First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to 
yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees 
that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference 
you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy 
to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or 
the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, 
in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean 
anyway!).  

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week.

Merci!

Susan

Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch 
with her.  I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable 
deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically 
switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking.  
Remember I have water covered.  Call or e-mail if you have questions!

Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico??

Frazier tells me he's available.  How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on 
Kirby @ Richmond?

Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to
Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics
for the luncheons, which Frazier and I have been trying to do for a while.
I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks
at EBA in DC and proposals they are pushing at the Houston chapter.

Oooh, "venue." I like it.  The 24th is good with me.  How about either
Pappadeaux or Pappasito or anything else around the Kirby/59 area?  Should

I am free for lunch on 12/4.  I'll see if Frazier's available.
Why don't we choose a venue somewhere between Duke and downtown.

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Does lunch on Monday, December 4th work for
your schedules?  If not, let's hear a counter-offer.

Susan,

I go this email as well.  Unfortunately, I've been busy as well and didn't
really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can
understand our roles/duties/functions a little better (hey, aren't we both

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Let's plan on Friday before Christmas!  And Craig will join us, I'm sure.  
Please stay over at my place that night.  That way you would not have to 
worry about driving all the way back to Tomball after partying downtown -- 
and we'd get to visit longer! 
Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office.  
It is a big drag.  Sheila came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, 
and had to be hospitalized!  I think I should count myself lucky I only have 
the office bug.  She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to 
Austin.  Sounds like she is feeling a lot better.
We're having a surprise party for Craig's 40th on Friday!  I don't know 
whether he suspects anything...
Time for more cough medicine!

And we're coming to Houston!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Houston this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Santa Monica Civic Center then tried to find a 
turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Houston on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of North Houston. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue

Frazier tells me he's available.  How about 11:45 at Little Pappasito's on 
Kirby @ Richmond?

Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to
Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics
for the luncheons, which Frazier and I have been trying to do for a while.
I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks
at EBA in DC and proposals they are pushing at the Houston chapter.

Oooh, "venue." I like it.  The 24th is good with me.  How about either
Pappadeaux or Pappasito or anything else around the Kirby/59 area?  Should
take you guys the same amount of time getting out of downtown.   11:30? (to
beat the lunch crowd).

Jeffery Fawcett
11/29/2000 10:58 AM
The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=
ers=01, ability to=20
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=
=20

daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;
=01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations;
=01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru=
m for=20
more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
=01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar=
e intended to=20
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
=01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon=
thly=20
imbalance
tolerance;
=01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci=
ng rules=20
and penalties
as all other shippers;
=01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig=
n and=20
reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20
board set up
for it;
=01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex=
ceeding=20
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=
sts.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=
=20
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=
=20
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =

than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-

=20
other restruc-
turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain=

the costs to most ratepayers.=018

I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the 
Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for 
rehearing?  

Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=
=20
recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=
=20
2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=
ck=20
of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20
market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in=
=20
TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=
=20
price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20
possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20
request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20
showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds=
=20
all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=
=20
the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01("firm transportation" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=
oses=20
we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20
Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=
ther=20
pipelines are a "good substitute" only if shippers can obtain the same=20
quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=
=20
service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20
10%.  All relevant "origin markets" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=
=20
as well as "destination markets," and alternatives for shippers in those=20
markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=
=20
if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=
=20
used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=
=20
alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20
quantity.

3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20
competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=
=20
factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by HHI.=
 =20
Market concentration has to be calculated for each relevant receipt point a=
nd=20
delivery point.  HHI is calculated by adding up the total market share and=
=20
squaring it.  There is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation=
=20
services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities.

4.  Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues.

Received your message.  Do we want to file a response to PNM's protest?  It 
basically contains the same arguments they launched at our 637 filing, and we 
did not file an answer to that.

Kevin -- I've looked at the pooling agreement and I agree with you -- I don't 
believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement.  
Any further questions, let me know.

Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and 
coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor 
tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.  

Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check 
with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight 
ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am 
asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece 
fabric and comes in a v-neck style...

I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is 
buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift 
certificate idea.  

So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine 
this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!

Camp2scott@aol.com on 12/04/2000 04:04:44 PM
The doc thinks I probably had the flu.

Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I 
raised last week?
If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and 
I'll schedule something around them.  Thanks.

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

   
	
	

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today 
and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving 
on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I 
go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from 
legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc.

With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.

I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA.  I'm with ETS 
Legal.

   
	
	

I want to recap our understanding of the key cultural/behavioral attributes 
that you said were important to interview for.      If you want to add to 
this please don't hesitate to do so.   We will form a questionnaire tailored 
to your group's needs. 

The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with 
new situations on a constant day to day basis.   This person would become 
bored and restless with routine.   This person would also enjoy learning at a 
relatively fast and voluminous rate. 
The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and 
can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted.   There 
are techniques as well as questions that can address this. 
The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, 
follow-through, and persistence.   They must be equipped with an ability to 
cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done.    
They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.    It is difficult 
for the candidate to create a story that combines examples of all of these 
traits unless it truly happened.   If they have these traits, they have used 
them in the past. 
Relatively thick skinned.   How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands?   
A desire to be in control of situations is also a desirable trait.  These 
applicants must want to make decisions and control outcomes almost all of the 
time.   Not to be confused with micro-managers or control freaks 
(yeah-buts).   
Lastly, they must have an entrepreneurial focus.    They need to be the 
people that make it happen, with possibilities but without guarantees  of 
personal gain, a desire to take ultimate responsibility, and influence others 
to get it done and make them feel good about it.   The how, what, when, 
where, and why of being in a leadership role. 

We will start formulating the questions and the order in which they should be 
asked today.   Do you have any candidates in the near future?   We would be 
glad to help you with interviewing tips.

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have 
questions.

Attached is my first try at our motion to extend time.  Your written comments 
would be appreciated.

Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for 
Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline 
Company.,

Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 
will be held on Jan. 9 at 10:00.  A notice will be issued shortly.  

Don't you have work to do??

I believe this message was intended for Susan M Scott of ENA; I'm with ETS

Apparently they now have more people than they know what to do with, so none 
of us are needed. Thanks anyway, Susan, for offering to fill in and, Sheetal, 
for extraordinary networking. 

Martha, I don't have any bullets but could you please send me last week's -- 
I think there are some old ones that need to be deleted.  Thanks.

Please get your bullets in tomorrow in the morning.  Tomorrow night is our 
Christmas party and we want to leave the office early so we can get home and 
get pretty before the event.

Thanks......Martha

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Here's my best shot(s):

NatCom Energy Services, Inc.

Streamline Energy Services, Inc.

Handyman Energy Services, Inc.

Enable Energy Services, Inc.  (var. Enerable)

Basnea Corp.
Basne Energy Management
DeviaOne

Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks 
fine.

   CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Phillips Petroleum 
Company.  Phillips has agree to extend their 30,000 Dth/d Ignacio to El 
Paso/Blanco contract for five years beginning 2/1/2001.  The one-part 
seasonal rate structure of $.04 (April-Oct) and $.035 (Nov-March) will 
escalate by $.005  each of the last two years.  Phillips may use a south to 
north alternate flow path for an incremental $.01 based on actual utilization.

Please  approve via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  
All officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential 
approval

Thanks

This document contains both the El Paso and TW information.  I'll bring you 
the printouts of the relevant El Paso tariff provisions.

Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.  
I'm reachable at 713-494-5002 for the rest of today.

George Gilbert entered an Annuity and changed the status to Not To Be 
Confirmed.  This will not be settled by settlements because no comments were 
entered to be Settled Financially.  Do you know what this annuity is related 
to?

Please let me know.

Thank you,

Financial Confirmations

Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although 
given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than 
never, right?)  Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've 
been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table 
as well).  

But Laura was right, Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is 
that? - so she'll make sure I know what's going on.

Can't wait to see you guys,
Susan

   

Please respond to ljahnke@aerotek.com
Girls-
Thank you for the responses.  So far it has been overwhelmingly
positive!  I really can't wait to get us all together.  Emily had
suggested Ousies's Table-as well as a coworker of mine.  Yesterday
during our lunch break we went and looked at Ousies's and it seems
pretty cute.  Unfortunately they were not open, but I heard they light
it up at night and it is supposed to be really pretty.  The other
suggestion is Benji's.  Lis-you made a good point.  It would be nice to
try somewhere new.
I have not heard from Sarah or Kelly-so if you talk to them-please pass
them the message.  I know Kelly usually checks her email, but I am not
sure about Sarah.  If anyone has a number for her-let me know.  I also
haven't heard from Susan Scott-so Lisa- you are in charge of that.
Ashley-I know you've gotten this message-so reply!  : )
Corinne-Sorry that you will not be able to make it. : (  If anything
changes-let us know.
Jen's flight comes in around 7 that night-so I thought we would make the
reservations for 8-830 so she has time to make it.
Let me know what ya'll think.
-Laura

As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron 
building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and 
try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to 
know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).  
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective 
lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special 
things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note 
and let me know what's new in your life.

Love you guys,
Susan

Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be 
crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.  
We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
"Fam".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well 
right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.

The only one I'm still not really sure about is Stanfield, which is in red.

Hey Alicia,

The book code is ALWAYS - XZ.  As for trade dates, that is not one of the 
fields I fill in for the exotics spreadsheet and I don't think that's 
something we'd really want to add as the file already takes up an extremely 
large amout of memory.

You guys better brace yourselves...there are some real doozies.  I keep 
waiting for HR to just show up one day and fire us all ( her for telling the 
stories and us for listening).

   

The best part about it is we get to sit next to Sherry now.  I can't wait to 
hear the stories!!

Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

   

Please respond to bronwyn_tull@lycos.com
Hi Susan!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Houston?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Houston.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Bronwyn

Hey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!

Hey Susan! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,
Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.
Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRA
one summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both Kyle and Quinn on the "truly unisex names" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

double check, we're getting together next Monday night right?

Susan

Sorry Beatrice,

I sent this to Greg and forgot to send it to you as well.  This is a

Dan,

I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing 
with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of 
Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts 
seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I 
wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather 
than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me 
know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is 
limited up here).

Thanks,
Susan

On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure 
through a discount report.  

Larry, 

For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send 
you (GDOpt&Swap and PipePos).  If you have access to the rest of the system 
here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems.  
If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure 
out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you 
need anything.

I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take 
a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an 
answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Amerex:  
They show you Buying a 1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call 
Option at $0.26.  The counterparty was Cinergy...Let me know if this is a 
good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.

Susan,

Attached in the file are the testing results.

 Also you can run a script file to test more PID/deals if you'd like . This 
script file uses my modified version of PORTCALC, and  is on  UNIX,:
  ~stang/port_calc_test.csh you can go to my home  directory  ~stang, then 
type port_calc_test.csh PID and run it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Shouan

The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no 
longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.  If I 
don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge 
one and fax it to them.  Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't 
mind.  Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.

Hope things are going well.  I actually worked 21 straight hours the other 
day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

Well, how does it feel to be back?  I'm sure, even though our fair city can't 
compete with London for history and culture, there are a few things you've 
missed about this place.  Hope the flight back was good and I'm sure I'll be 
seeing you around.

Susan

Lorraine, see the attached.  I added "Maximum" and "Minimum" to the chart but 
don't know whether I got it backwards...anyway, let's talk if you have any 
questions.

If you could run the same valuation for Deal #'s QC1431.1 and QC1431.2 using 
Post-id 956785, we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value 
the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +/- .  Call me if you 
have any questions.

Thanks, 
Susan

The deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.  I'm 
going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the 
basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations.

Shouan Tang
11/28/2000 06:00 PM
Hi Susan,

I changed the code so that it feeds the Ostrip model as Larry requested by 
using the formula to derive BasisOffset. In the attached file is the 
comparison between the old valuation and the one after the modification. 
Please note the changes on the premiums. Please let me know if you or Larry 
have any questions/comments on this. 

Shouan

Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could 
probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire 
way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I 
need to do anything to sign up for the run?  

   

any chance you'd be up for an 8K run on saturday?? only problem is that it 
starts at 8:00am- too painful after your late night?? no obligation.....

At 01:37 PM 11/28/2000 -0600, you wrote:

Okay, so here's the debate...There's a flight out Friday night leaving 
Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

Susan

   

HI Susan-? I'm sure you got this cute email, but just in case.....What was

I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger 
was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."  How weird is that?  Anyway, hope 
you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly.  
I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, 
I'll know more about my London prospects.

   I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist 
and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts 
were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  "Guys might think they want a 
pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one."
     She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."

Start at the bottom and work your way up....I'd forgotten this is how I get 
over guys, flush-out the shortcomings of their wit.

Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to 
have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my 
possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.  As for the bet, 
if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little 
bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as 
an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good 
times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading 
loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.

This email would have been impressive if you had the "cojones" to bet 
up-front but being a true longhorn fan explains your lack of spine.  I don't 
think Texas is that good rather A&M is that bad.  Besides, we all know that 
the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  UCLA will 
dominate next year and Texas will be forced to play second fiddle to the 
likes of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas State etc.  yet again.  I hope your 
Thanksgiving went well and you had some fun in Austin.  I will give you 
credit on one thing, the vest is a no-no and my days of playing Chip are over 
(the vest is being given to an aggie - those cult like people).  No old age 
references to the show Chips because that would just be mean.  I hope your 
Monday is going well.  

ps: I was rooting for the Longhorns and I am glad they waxed the Aggies.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)

Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project 
yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped 
me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to 
knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.  
Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some 
repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably 
will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me 
decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between "Happy 
Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I 
decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to 
the professionals.

Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy 
dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like 
to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around 
here will join us.

Hope your weekend project was a success.  

Talk to you soon!

Love,
S.

It was very small and petty of me, but I couldn't resist.  Start with the 
last message and work your way up to get the full story.  

Good luck studying,
Susan

Hey Chris,

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment 
complex can send you some info.  regarding getting your name taken off of our 
lease.  If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass 
it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving 
and all.  I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with 
both of our parents and extended family members.  Have a great holiday and 
root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).

Love,
Susan

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  Unfortunately, I'm not a 
betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I 
can't vote against my alma mater)...so I will kindly refrain from any 
wagers.  

Have a great Thanksgiving Holiday,
Susan

The options book is still the options book and I think I will have put in at 
least 36 of my 40 hours this week.  I know, I know...I'm not working hard 
enough,

   

So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 
pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.  If that works for you I'm 
going to go ahead and book the ticket now.  

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.  As for 
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.  
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.  I think it was more of an ego 
thing on my part.  Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on 
guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.  I'm not 
taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed 
respite.

Let me know about the times.

Susan 

Hey Julie,

Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more 
than earned it).  

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,  your new apartment/roommate 
and Brendan are all doing.  All are wonderful I hope.  I realize this is 
somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San 
Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of 
Dec. 15?  I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally 
understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.  Regardless, this 
deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it doesn't 
look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a 
visit mid-January or February.  

Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Susan

I completely forgot to call you this afternoon...it got kind of crazy around 
here.  If you're going to be at the flat any time tomorrow shoot me off and 
email and I'll call you in the morning, ....otherwise I'll talk to you 
tomorrow when you get to H-town.

It sounds great...we'll figure out a good time then.  I've really missed you 
guys these last few weeks.  I've been completely MIA.

John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).

The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed 
to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?

Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and 
mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before "hope springs eternal".

Talk to you soon,
Susan
  

Darren Maloney@ENRON

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren

Hey Wilson,

Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

Susan

you still in Houston or where are you and what are you up to>
I have not heard from you in quite a while.

So what have you been up to and how is Enron treating you. when are you going 
to London.

All is well here...well work is very stressful, but it's cool and i do love 
my job despite all the bitching i do.
It's just a lot of strss.
I've made some big move and actually won a big project over a VP.
You will be seing me soon in Houston. (can't tell you more)

Anyway
Partying like crazy..that's all I do..girls..girls...and more girls...i can't 
even remember all their names OUPS>
Still in love with Shannon, and no she is still not in my life and yes she is 
still in Houston...I hope life helps a little on this one.
Partying..like 4-5 times a week..
But above all, working out like an animal. It's been really good and i'm 
starting to look like i did at Enron...a machine.
Running a lot and working out...

So what is up with you?

Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.  As far as "free 
nights" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.  
Katy and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL 
margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever 
they may be the drinks are on me.  (Although given your increased tolerance 
these days, you may break me).  The reason I was asking about when you were 
coming home is...Jeffy Jeff is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of 
December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if 
we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back 
until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - I have encouraging news regarding London, I'll tell you more about it 
when I talk to you.

   

hey- am coming home on dec 13th, arriving around 2pm- and am leaving
tomorrow to come home- get in houston at 2pm as well.  heard you ran into
little ken the other day- am so jealous!  what happened?  tried to call
yesterday, but no answer.....what's been going on?  long time, no
talk.....let me know asap about any potential get togethers or "free"nights
you and everyone might have over the holiday week.  see you soon....

Strangely enough a Tuesday night would probably be better for me too.  I 
think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well 
know, I'm up for anything.  As for restaurants, I just tried this new place 
called Bossa's and it was really good.  It's right across from the Rice Hotel 
downtown and has a neat atmosphere.  Of course there are also all kinds of 
places around our "area of town" that would be great as well...PF Chang's, Mi 
Luna, Americas, La Griglia (sp?), etc. etc.  Just let me know the time and 
place.

Thanks again Lisa for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.

Susan

PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or 
tomorrow night let me know.  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever.

I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the 
leasing office closes.  I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that 
won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any 
necessary papers.  My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.

Sue,

We had a message from the apt. office about renewing our lease. If we renew 
we can get our carpet cleaned for free, I THINK?  Let me know if you need me 
to do anything.  They have been sending you the renewal notices and leaving 
you the messages, so I am not sure if you need to instigate it.

let me know

Still need to add a few things, but most of it's already there.  The only 
things missing are the GD files we created and the GD FOM valuation problem 
that I've been working on with Shouan and Jeremy (there was a bug in the 
code).

FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.

Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
of a range object is failing. The simple
fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.

Cheers.

Agustin,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Susan

hey- just checked- JJW playing at gruene hall fri dec 15th- his sat show is
sold out.  any interest or poss. that you could leave work around 3-4 and
go?  just emailed katy about going up earlier and shopping which i know you
prob couldn't do, but could be a fun girls' nite out in NB.  kind of have to
jump on this asap b/c tix are going to sell out soon!  if you can email me
back in next 5 mins, do so, if not try to give me a quick call later- am
jogging home from the internet store, so should be home in about 45 mins!
hope all is well- and hope SINCERELY that the f*%o'n morons in florida get
swallowed up by a giant tidal wave.  IF YOU CAN'T READ A DAMN BALLOT, DON'T
VOTE!  and you DEFINITELY shouldn't be able to vote if you're shameless
enough to speak out PUBLICALLY and admit you CAN'T read a ballot....!
aughhhhhhh!  just one more bit of evidence that supports my theory that all

appropriately......

Low blow with the "weekends are my time..." comment.  Anyway, Friday should 
be cool so just go ahead and give me a call in the afternoon and we'll go 
from there.  

Susan

- - Gas prices up almost $.50 in two days...it is a madhouse around here.  

   

First off I hope your still not at work when I send this.

Secondly it would be cool to meet earlier in the week but I'm in San Antonio
and will be until Friday.  I will be driving to Houston on Friday morning to
do some packing and then the parents will be coming up on Saturday morning
to help with the final move.  I will pretty much leave it in your ball park
about Friday night.  I know you have been working long hours and Friday is
just a bad day.  Even though I would like to see you, if you have a repeat
of last week then I understand if you want to call it off.  In that case
maybe we can meet up some other time.  Although I do remember a girl telling
me once that weekends are her time and she was going to go out no matter
what.

Let me know what you think and I'll probably give you a call Friday
afternoon to see how things are going.

Thanks for the attached deal information, Shouan.  Looking at the data I feel 
confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily 
options curveshift is valuing correctly.  However, I am still concerned with 
the valuation from 10/31.  Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 
11/3 for 10/31's position.  If you could send me that information in the same 
format I think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall 
out of my trader's book on 11/1.

not change month to month, it is always XZP.

Please include book codes for these deals.

The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in 
redlining.  I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but 
in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.  Many of my changes are simply 
to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined 
terms).  

In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph, 
I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if 
not, ignore my change.  2) Section 4.a.  -- their provision for an adjustment 
seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so 
I left it in.  If you don't like it, let me know.  3)  In Section 5, I just 
tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.  Let me know 
if this does not agree with your intent.

Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to 
proceed.

you how happy I am that I didn't have to question the intelligence of my

Hey Kyle,

You'll be happy to know that I think I finally caught up on all of the sleep 
I've been missing out on of late.  Last week was extremely trying at work, I 
think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs. between Monday and Friday, and thus 
resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.  Anyway, 
I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before 
embarking on your new career with Valero.  I'm sure your decision to leave 
Enron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.    

In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together 
before you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late 
(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  
However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let 
me know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's 
probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey 
(i.e. me).

Susan

Marcelo,

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need TAGG deal 
numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
models.  

Thanks,
Susan

Susan, Matt,

I was told by Zhiyong last week that he had a green light for the Gas X Gas 
spreads in Enpower. Have any of you hear anything about it? At this point I 
have sent some needed changes in the "front end" to Duong Luu, and I'll be 
ready to test when these changes are done. If any of you still have a "hold" 
on this project please let me know so we can get all cleared up.

BTW, I've been moved to the 25th floor, desk EB2519a.

Regards, Marcelo

Jessica,

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.  

Susan

   

Susie-just wanted to say hello and see how your trip went!!  Hope you had a
ball.  Also, I wanted to let you know that Clay and I are having family and
friends over for food and beer after the game this weekend and would love to
see you.  We are at 1810 Palma Plaza--if you take Enfield towards Mopac, take
a left at the light at Hartford, take a right on Palma Plaza, we are the last
(blue) duplex on the right before Mopac; our half faces Palma Plaza and the
other half faces Mopac.  If you forget these directions--my number is

That is weird.  I received your first message.  

Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor 
Facilities.  Do you have this?
Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.

Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents 
Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.

Thank you!

   
	
	

Thats weird, my computer just deleted the recipients from the email below.  
I'll try again--do you guys still work here?  DF 

   
	
	

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF 

Let me know if any of the deals values in the attached file are incorrect.

Thanks, 
Susan

Stacey,

I was wondering if there was still room in the brown bag today with Dan 
Reck.  If there are spaces available, I would like to add my name to the list

Thanks,
Susan

Deal #Q75558.2 - Counterparty is CIA Papelera Mandonado and the counterparty 
contact is Francisco Elosua.  Agustin Perez is the originator on the deal.

Susan,

Well you have either had a week from hell so far or its just taking you time
to come up with some good bs.  Without being too forward I will be in town
next Friday and wanted to know if you would like to go to dinner or
something.  At least that will give us a chance to talk face to face.  If
your busy don't worry about it I thought I would just throw it out there.

I'll keep this one short and sweet since the last one was rather lengthy.
Hope this Thursday is a little better then last week.

Thanks.  As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily 
convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).  Halloween at the 
Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in 
machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.

Susan

By the way,  you'll have to question  the college coaches and sports writers 
out there if you have any issues with the rankings.  I am merely the 
messenger.

Deal # Q47477 has been rebooked.

Please rebook to Peoples Gas, Light and Coke.

Thanks

Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to 
terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise.

Kyle,

I want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me.  I was 
hoping to be able to respond with the same kind of care and consideration you 
showed, but - as you can see from the time on this email - today has been a 
bit on the rough side.  I will continue my thoughts tomorrow when I have more 
time to gather them, but until then I wanted you to know that I did get the 
email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most 
touching things ever said to me.  And, please know that you would never, ever 
be put in one of my stalker catagories...you could never be lumped in any 
catagory with the SP's of the world.

Susan

As for the good-bye, I would have to give it high marks as well.

Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie.

Don't know when you'll get a chance to read this, but I must confess it made 
me a bit teary eyed.  I didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent.

As for New Year's Eve, I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey.  As much as I'd 
love to see Gary P., I don't really want to risk the drive and I'm guessing 
no one else does either. 

Hope you had a good weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

By the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at
least it is number one in my book.

The Post-Ted Susan is out of control.  In less than a week's time I have 
mugged down with 3 guys and have a fourth one emailing me to go out 
sometime.  Funny thing is I'm not really interested in any of them, just 
having fun.  Hope all well with you.

Susan

No need to apologize for keeping me out Wednesday night, it was probably more 
a case of me keeping myself out (I have been known to do that on occasion).  
I'm sorry I didn't return your call yesterday, but I had a pretty crazy day 
here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively 
cut me off from the outside world.  As for being upset about anything, don't 
worry I'm not.  You know me well enough to know that my actions are my own.  
I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Austin Saturday night or not, but in 
case I do my cell # is 281-844-0866.  

Susan

I'll see you at Purvi's happy hour if you end up going.

Since you may or may not return my call I thought I would shoot you an
email.  I'm sorry for keeping you out soo late on Wednesday and anything
else that you may be upset about.  Anyway I will be in Austin on Saturday
night and was hoping we could meet up.  The only thing is I have no way of
getting a hold of you.  So, here is my cell number and I should at least
have this until the end of November:  281-216-5005.  I already got Vic's and
Trey's number so maybe we can all hook up on sixth street.  You can always
respond to this or give me a call with your number.  I may swing by Purvi's
happy hour tonight so maybe I'll see you there.

By the way I have never been married and I'm not 28 yet.

So....Can you cover me for one night next week?

I could be back the next morning by 8:00 am.

Hi Susan!

Your name has been mentioned for another UT recruiting opportunity.  Brent 
Price and Rick Causey are going up next week and would like to know can you 
accompany them.  Please give Brent's assistant Chatelle Villanueva a buzz @ 
36279 for the details.  Hope you can make it!

Thanks,

weather there.

I really miss football--I'm jealous for that.  Is is pass mustard or muster?  
You're right--tough cookie, who deserves a good man.  I'll screen for you.  
20 questions on short call as needed (provided that the info from friends 
thing didn't apply to me....).  Actually I was just developing a social 
circle there and whammo....I'm here.  I figure I'm here to kick some tail and 
worry about the social element later.  Don't get me wrong, I am drinking on 
the w/e's.  Unfortunately I am not meeting the TX & CA women type.  I got no 
Euro-rap....

Been talking to Wilson?  I have been AOL-IMing him.  He seems okay as 
usual--women the same, work on the up with a new boss.  That's all for now.  
Getting sick.  Think I will go home early tonight (relative).  Talk to you 
soon!  

--Darren

Your welcome.  

As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.  I've been up in Austin 
practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go 
out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social 
again.  There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a 
bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.  
Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this 
evening.  Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving 
Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how 
convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the "market" so to 
speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know 
that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am 
somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I 
can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to 
let that color my opinion too much.  Not to worry about your former neighbor 
either, I haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay 
with me.

Drop me a line when you get the chance,
Susan

Thanks for the update.  I worked for Jay but wrote the whole thing myself 
(50pgs on Grains).  
How are you?  What's new in Tejas?  What's up on the man front?(--no not my 
old neighbor)
I'll write a bit more soon.  I've been jammed lately and unfortunately it is 
not getting any better.
:)  Thanks for the note.  Looking forward to coming back and having a cold 
one in TX.  I'll buy 
you one!  Silk of the warm ones here.....

Hey Darren,

Just thought I'd let you know that Billy Lemmons mentioned you by name in one 
of the Analyst/Associate brown bag lunches.  He was talking about the Ag 
Trading initiative and who spear-headed the effort (I think the other guy he 
mentioned was Jay Fitzgerald).  Anyway, thought you'd like to now you're 
definitely making a name for yourself around here.  Hope things are going 
well with you.

Talk to you soon,

Susan

I believe this email was intended for you.

FYI.  For meeting with PG&E (which is Tues., Oct. 31, from 10 am-Noon (PDT) 
in Enron's SF offices.

Yes, the deal would have been for today.  I'm not sure who the trader was and 
Larry has already left for the day.  I will probably just leave a note for 
him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.  

Thanks,
 Susan

   

For today?  Also, do you know roughly what the of the deal is because I only 
see Chris Lambie's and John Mckay's deals
.
Today's deals do not contain any deals at Sumas with Larry May, again, I am 
speaking of John  Mckay and Chris Lambie.

Carlos

Did any of your traders do a deal with Larry May at Sumas selling half-a-day 
at +.03?

Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.  This language is 
very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates 
issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me 
know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we 
work something out with Phillips today.

By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their 
right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language 
(i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in 
exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be 
inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give 
Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).

Christine Stokes
01/28/2000 09:44 AM
Susan - Here is the language that Phillips has requested.  They liked and had 
requested the exact wording inserted into their agreement, so if there any 
any changes that you feel needs to be made, please try to keep the changes as 
simple as possible.  Thanks!

In the event that Transwestern's minimum tariff rate is increased to a level 
above Shipper's discount rate provided herein, the parties agree to 
renegotiate the discount to achieve the same economic value to both parties.

Thought you'd get a kick out of this one.  By the way, did you guys end up 
doing the "holiday greeting" thing?

I was just wondering if there was any more information available regarding 
the upcoming Super Saturday events.  I would be glad to help out in any 
capacity.

Thanks,
Susan

Marcelo,

Evidently, there has been some discussion regarding the use of Enpower for 
Natural Gas basis options.  As a result I've been advised to hold off on any 
meetings until further notice.  Thanks again for all of your help and I will 
be in touch with you as soon as I know how we are going to progress.

originator on the deal is Agustin Perez.

    For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,
                     health, and daily life. Stressful matters beyond your 
control have leached away

may be expected to
                     kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. Are you 
willing -- or not? I can't
                     blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to 
compromise your
                     vision. But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 
weeks to cook up an
                     agreement you can live with. 

Looks good.

Thanks for the heads-up,
Susan

I just got the email from our UT recruiter naming all of the Super Saturday 
candidates.  Kudos.  I'm so glad we didn't embarrass ourselves by overlooking 
you a second time.  I'll see what I can do about getting assigned to your 
dinner group.  See you this weekend.

GO BUSH!

My mother taught me the value of education, so every day I would walk 5
miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp,
thought I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve
as the inspiration for "Huckleberry Finn."

Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens.
One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if
anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all
Americans.  Well, I guess I made an impression.  You see, the minister's
name was Martin Luther King, Jr.

My father was a United States Senator.  He once perched me on his knee
and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you
can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep
school."

But life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school
diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled
at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.
Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my
close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae."

When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard
called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to
four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and
was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I
lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a
little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.

But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country.  So
I enlisted in the U.  S.  Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply
opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home
with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.

When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.
I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man,
I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.
And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters
on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need you in
Washington."

I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other
business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon
Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer,
and coming up with the recipe for Mrs.  Field's chocolate chip cookies.

Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and
allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate,
where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter
day nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, I answered the call
of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President
of the United States.

Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in
American history.  And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet.
Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has
asked me what to do.  And when I would give him my thoughts, he would
invariable say, "Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of
that?" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president
told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form
that dark-haired intern.

So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked
if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.
And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll
never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, "Al, just tell the
truth, it's always worked for me."

Just thought you'd like to know that Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 stars.  He 
had many of the same comments to make about the film and Dallas as you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:

I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years 
I've lived 
there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
my street, 
have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
days 
afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
I have 
heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
crop of 
mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
residents 
of the Heights this summer. 

Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
Heights?  Last 
year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
but got no 
response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
that the City 
of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 

Any information you can provide would be appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

Susan Scott 
815 Cortlandt St.

You need to give me your messenger address so we can "talk".

Those were great Chris.  Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to 
London, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore 
swamped.  Mom said you guys had a great time in China.  I hope you took lots 
of pictures.  I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it 
doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes 
again.  I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. 
ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.  So, I'm going to see if 
there's a way I could come over next spring.  Regardless, I very excited 
about you and Chuck coming back to Houston in December and we'll just have to 
make up some quality time then.

PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.  I mean 
honestly what goes through these guys heads.  They don't realize a "good 
thing" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the 
"good thing" is no longer interested.

I am definitely interested in the parking space at the Met.  Please let me 
know if it is still possible for me to acquire a space.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Thanks

Hey Em,

Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love 
this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering 
withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure 
that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me 
my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really 
don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I 
want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I 
haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy 
worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of 
his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the 
reverse of that is true as well).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the 
added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

   

oh, the wonders of technology.  here i am, 1000's of kilometers away,
communicating via email with you fabulous folks.  have just stumbled in from
a pub featuring an irish 'jig' band- i picked up the rhythem instantly, i
must admit.....and after only 12 pints!  needless to say, it was a brilliant
cultural experience, and the only thing that would've been better would've
been if all of you could have been there to a., mock and harass me, and b.,
make yourselves as hated as this american made herself....why is that cider
makes you want to sing show tunes and bitch about shitty english  washing
machines....?  anyways- just wanted you to know i was thinking of you- even
if it WAS  after i thought for 15 minutes where the closest burger king was
( *jen- this is as close as you're going to get to those ridiculous
miniature books w/ PMS quotes you're so fond of......how id boulder by the
way...?)  sue- glad you got home okay- going thru withdrawl yet?  matt- got
your emails- twice.  double thanks.  hope my biting response hasn't sent you
into therapy- yet.  kk, llkj,etc- hope all is well in lala land- just fyi- i
think red bull is cheaper here- imagine the possibilities!  and for the reat
of the gang- enjoy yourselves at the infamous cougar 5 yr- i will- OF
COURSE- be there in spirit.....and i'm not being cynical, really......

I doubt I'll have one Mondays especially!

On Monday it will be time to check your pulse...

Glad to hear things are going so well.  No, I haven't spoken with Ted since 
my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an 
undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
partners and maybe even fidelity.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
wasn't "ALL his fault", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
around Enron a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
situation.  Tell Brendan I said, "Hello" and good luck with the new role at 
work.

Susan

I have a hold on travel plans to Korea right now as work may interfere.  Oh, 
well.

You guys are going to kill me, but I just got a ticket on the floor for the 
Rockets game tonight.  I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few 
of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.  I definitely 
want to see everyone and could "go out" later if anyone's interested.

Hey Julie,

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

Susan

PS - I think you're right about the California men.  I am currently in 
contact with about three of them and they all have issues.  Although, I still 
think Ted takes the cake. 

Jeremy,

I saved the file so that the tab you open it up on is Larry's Gas Daily 
Option model.

Em, you know I'm in on this one.  It's been far too long since we've had a 
true NB weekend.  Unfortunately (although not surprisingly) it appears our 
erstwhile friend Alan will claim any excuse, no matter how unappealing, to 
avoid singing show tunes around the camp fire - your voice will be missed.  
For the rest of you guys, I hope we can muster a good turn-out as I am in 
desperate need of over analysis in regards to the problems of the world as 
well as ourselves whilst in a drunken stupor.  Nobody does it better...

Susan

   

ok- i'm going to remain skeptical and cautious about this til i get more
feedback (yes, kk, i know where you stand!)  who is interested in spending
this new years in NB @ the river and going to gruene hall?  need to commit
fairly soon, as there have been 'bites' from other interested parties, and
we'll just rent it out if interest is low.....those who haven't responded,
pls drop me a line, make suggestions.....can't have TOO many people due to
size restrictions, but obviously significant others/spouses are welcome.  am
sure i'm forgetting a key person or 2 from this email- let me know who!
don't want to hurt feelings (you KNOW how sensitive I am....)but want to
make sure we have a 'cohesive' group.  keep me posted.....au revoir from the
land of bangers and mash....

Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in London.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,
Susan 

Hey Darren,

Just wanted to say thanks again for including Em and I in the outing Friday 
night and joining us for dinner Monday.  Hope things with work are going well 
and that you're managing to reinvent the wheel without too many problems.  

Cheers,
Susan

Ashley,

I am so sorry we never managed to meet up while I was in London.  Emily and I 
spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets, etc. and 
Monday I ended-up spending a lot longer than I planned at the office.  On the 
bright side, I was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few 
people while I was there.  I'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed 
by early next spring.  Hope things are well with you and the next trip I make 
over there we will definitely get together.

Susan

Trip was excellent.  I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside 
pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.  I definitely thought about you and 
how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and 
proper).  I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll 
see.  I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am 
suffering a bit of jet lag.

Susan

Hello my friend. Hope you are well. First, how was your trip? Secondly, did 
you get many pictures? Thirdly, did you think about me the whole time you 
were there...saying in your mind "Tobin would have liked this?"
Drop a note and give me the dirt.

Drew, what is BNSF?

Here you go Cynthia.  I feel pretty confident that everything is correct this

or email me with any changes.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to drop a line and let you know that I'm going to be visiting 
London over the next 5 days or so.  I'm planning on swinging by the offices 
Monday morning to see everyone and just wanted to foreworn you all.  
Hopefully, I'll get a chance to see you then.

If anyone wants to get a hold of me you can leave a message on my friend 
Emily's phone 020 7243 5453.

Lexi,

I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting 
trip.  Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have 
been for you.  In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the 
hard copy to your office.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to 
help with the process.

Here's the address for you.

Agustin, 

I haven't booked the origination we talked about yet because I wanted to get 
an exact number from you first.  If you could send me an email with the 
correct origination amount I can book it tonight.  The deal was with General 
de Cermica for 11,000/month 10/1/00 - 03/31/0.

Thanks,

Hey,

Thanks for the well wishes.  I don't actually leave until Thursday, but I am 
VERY ready and equally excited.  I ended up meeting Ted for dinner Thursday 
to "chat".  He definitely doesn't deserve the title of Wonder Boy.  Anyway, 
I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question.  
Hope everything's good with you.

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual talking occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things 
just fade out"
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me."  Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems." (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)

I am very excited about my trip to London.  For one thing I get to visit 
Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work 
for 6 days straight.  You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I 
say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one 
because you think you should) you should definitely get it.  Just think what 
a great conversation piece it would make over the years.  

And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is 
impossible.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I think that you being in Korea 
and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder 
to deal with.  I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that 
they aren't as easy to get.

Love ya,
Susan

Do you know where the Texas Exes watch the games in London?  It might be kind 
of fun to watch the OU game somewhere...even if just for a bit of it.  Just a 
thought.

I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to 
catch you "real time."  

I went to the game Saturday with Travis, Corey, Mike and a friend of his.  
Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.  Anyway, Trav's pledge 
class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached 
status on career focus.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying 
both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill 
for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another 
Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
was a good birthday.  
Have a good day!

Karin Shelton <kss@overlandpartners.com> on 12/20/99 09:05:21 AM
Hi Susan! I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did. Hope you
will accept a late Happy Birthday from me! I am assuming that mum passed
along our gift to you whilst we were in Houston last. I hope so! Anyway, I
hope that you had a good day and that Bill took you out for a nice dinner.

Except for maybe a lipstick for the mem's,(was totally confused by the
selection at the HEB - need help) this elf is finished with Christmas
shopping. Good to have it done. Picked up some sox at Tar-zhay for her to
wear w/ the clogs.

More later!

Karin

Spoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about 
this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to 
call him, his # is 281-350-8441.

Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:

If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to 
expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement 
and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages 
are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of 
consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 
provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing 
Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas 
Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event 
of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's 
costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas 
volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  

Other questions -- let  me know.

Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize 
you'd called until last night.  I'm still at work right now and therefore am 
extremely tired.  Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this 
weekend.  I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class 
reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for 
me.  There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still 
old enough to know who they are and what they want.  Some critical things 
happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that 
can expose so many "issues" (examples of which I got to see several of on 
Saturday).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Are you and Doug going to OU?

Hey,

It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?  
Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special 
you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked 
to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you 
want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you 
have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following 
- jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, "rain coat" (I put 
it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some "go out" close, running 
shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I 
always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm 
assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. 

I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an 
email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed 
Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get 
together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. 

I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have 
much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get 
off at the Holland Park tube stop.  Should be a piece of cake, right?

Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?  
I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat 
(i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).  

See you soon,
Susan

- I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of 
course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's "past" - maybe you 
can find out why the marriage ended.

Shelly,

Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the 
times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.

Thanks,
Susan

Hey Ashley,

Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London 
this Friday through next Tuesday.  I'm visiting a friend of mine who is 
attending Sotheby's graduate program.  I know it's short notice, but I would 
love to see you at some point while I'm over there.  If you get a chance 
email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can 
get a hold of you while I'm over there.  Hope all is well.

Susan

Everything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual "talking" occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things 
just fade out"
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you 
say issues?
- He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me."  Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems." (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out 
and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very 
healthy for me) 

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with 
completely)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)

Talk to you soon, Jen.

I think an original tasters gathering is a great idea...unfortunately, I'm 
going to be out of town Thursday (I'm visiting my friend Emily in London and 
I have to admit I am very excited).  If you guys do end up going have a great 
time.

Susan

   

Ashlea is right, it was amazing.  It looked like a really fun crowd.  I hope
that everyone can be there.

Julianna

So I met him for dinner Thursday night.  Nothing was discussed until we were 
about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Turns out he was 
married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case 
in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated 
quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos. - 
sounds like a pattern to me). 

 We'll talk more later,

Hey Darren,

I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.  I 
talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a 
good night to try and get together.  I know you have a bunch of people that 
are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one 
big group outing.  Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set 
something up.

Susan

No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than
him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2.
I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.
Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present "condition"
could never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was
carrying him or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact
I have now dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?
I hope not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight
(Singapore Airlines).  I found a great deal from San Francisco for around
$580.  I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to
$800, but it's still the best deal around.  I can't wait to see you guys.

Susan

Here's my request for rehearing so far.  The marketing folks are helping me 
with our competitive harm argument and will, I hope, come up with something 
plausible.  In the meantime, I would appreciate your comments.

First of all sorry about the "overjealous" not
"overzealous" in my last e mail--it was late.

Anyway, to the important stuff...I think that's the
problem with dating 30 something guys who aren't
married.  Either a divorce in the past or too many
other hang ups (and this guy looks like he fits into
both categories).  I know that everyone says that, but
in my observation it has been true.  So you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.  You want the
maturity level of someone like him, but sometimes
those older men are too much of a headache.  I'm glad
you at least got to say your toughts.  I can't believe
you told him about the t-shirt!  Oh well, what did you
have to lose by getting it all out there.  I'm glad
your questions are answered now.  I guess there really
wasn't anything he could say to fix things between you
guys!  I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak
Night.

Alas, there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself.  There is good 
cause for your lack of enthusiasm.  

Tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break.  
How 'bout we shoot for around 9:30 (although I can do earlier or later if 
need be).  Let me know.

As for the week after next, anything from Wednesday night on will work for 
me.  I am in full agreement with you regarding a "solid dinner" (of limited 
attendance of course).

See you tomorrow,

Susan

 - - Funny thing, Ben called earlier to see if I wanted to go grab lunch with 
him (Does he think I'm in a vulnerable/weakened state due to the Ted 
situation?  Well, he's wrong.)

What's the point of living if I am not going to steak night with you?! 
Seriously, if you nor Kori and the like aren't going, I think I will go to a 
genuine steak house. :)
Let me know how your morning is looking tomorrow for coffee---or in my case 
steamed almond milk? Let me know. I will be here through Friday morning--must 
get back to P-Town for a little reprieve. By-the-way, not next week but the 
following week I will be back. We really need to do dinner and do a thorough 
debriefing and have a solid dinner. Enough of this "15- person, let's talk 
over smoke and voices" thing. I think I am getting old.

Yes, we still do the steak night thing, but I will be unable to attend this 
evening (dinner with the traders, oh la la!).  You may want to talk to bfree 
and see if he or Economou are planning on an outing.  

So when are we going to have a chance to chat?

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

Agustin,

I just faxed a copy of the ticket to you.  Please let me know if it 
transmitted properly.  Also, the deal number is Q15463.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hey Susan.

I just got a call from Patricia Ritter which made me realize that we only 
have 1 month to play all of our games... and with my travel schedule getting 
booked I thought I should get a start on playing some games.  Are you 
available anytime soon?

Thursday nights are always out for me as I have school from 6-10.  Next week 
I will be out of the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  

Let me know.

Part of me is tempted to do the "taste of your own medicine" thing, but I was 
really disappointed that he took that approach (in this case I think email is 
very cowardly) and don't believe two wrongs make a right.  I insist on taking 
the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach 
him a lesson.

Susan

I haven't done anything as of yet.  I just really didn't feel like responding 
to him on Friday (I was still pretty floored by the whole thing) and since 
he's out of town till tonight I spent yesterday and today figuring out what I 
want to do.  

I've decided the following...I'm going to give him a call tonight and agree 
to meet for a drink/chat.  I completely agree with you about regretting the 
things you don't do more than the things you do - besides I'm dying of 
curiosity about what he could possibly have to say.  Anyway, I want to try 
and do it tomorrow night so that I can quite turning it over and over in my 
head (I am absolutely sick of thinking about it).  I think it will be hard 
for me to be anything but distant talking to him because, regardless of his 
reasons, he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks.  Wish 
me luck! (Problem is I'm not sure what I really want the outcome to be).

Susan

Julie,

Just wanted to check and see if you had received my last two emails.  If so, 
I'd love to know what you think about the whole situation.  If not, let me 
know and I will resend the emails.

Susan

What's the word man?  I haven't heard a peep from you all day (even though I 
know you've seen Ben and called Kori...I'm hurt)

sscott5

FYI - Gary P. Nunn is going to be playing New Year's Eve at Gruene Hall.

On the Ted front...It's Tuesday afternoon and I haven't contacted him yet.  
I'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that 
"a beer and a chat sound like a good idea, how about tomorrow night?".  I 
will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early 
enough or tomorrow at work.  This should all prove very interesting.

Susan

Gary,

Just wanted to check and see how things were going for you on 44.  Hopefully 
you are now in possession of a phone.  If so give me a call, I would really 
like to get together for a cup of coffee or just a few minutes to enjoy the 
lovely weather outside.

sscott5

- I'm confident Keri and Caroline are well.

Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist.
There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market 
services, weren't there?
One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and 
FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language 
is already general enough to cover us there.
The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in 
the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.  
The tariff language as it's currently written says we "shall" issue an OFO, 
and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality 
and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there 
are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to 
sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later 
this afternoon, I'm available.
Thanks!
S.

The effective date will be 2/23/2000.  Marketing does not anticipate offering 
the service until March 1, 2000.

Susan is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15 
days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so 
the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).  The 
change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating 
FTS-1 & FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match 
FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated "existing" space as 
usual.  Susan is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a 
language change may not be necessary.  She will be discussing with Mary Kay.  
Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.

Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added 
to 22.2, D, 1.  Susan and Mary Darveaux are reviewing all the GT&C's to check 
for where FTS-3 &/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)

Please let me know.  Thanks!
Lindy

Lindy,  
Does this mean that the effective date will still be 2/23/2000?

Also did all of our changes that we discussed in our system requirement 
meetings get included in the revised tariff sheets?

What date will marketing start offering the service? I know we are still 
pushing to have the nominations, contracts, scheduling & confirmation system 
changes ready for 3/1/2000  production migration move.

Thanks Ramona

Sorry for the delayed response to your email, but 10-11 a.m. this morning 
will work for me.  Just let me know the location.

Thanks,
Susan

   

Susan,

I'm trying to schedule a meeting regarding gas spread  in enpower. We have a

                   HOROSCOPE:     Weekly   -    His

                   For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing
                   things were different, or woefully mourning the
                   past, build a new beginning. It's pointless to
                   bemoan recent changes or languish over
                   disappointments. You cannot change the past.
                   You cannot change people's minds, either. Face
                   your situation and create something wonderful.
                   The longer you fuss about what 'should have
                   been', the more likely it is that important
                   opportunities will drift by unnoticed. Cancer, it is
                   time for change. Release frustrations and
                   troubling memories. Move on, Crab. . . move
                   on. 

Mine for today

   Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding
   Once you've released toxic feelings,
                   the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your
                   pleasure. You're able to replace fear and
                   resentment with compassion and
                   understanding. Once you know the score, you
                   no longer feel threatened or disrespected. Keep
                   revenge out of this entire episode. 'Teaching
                   someone a lesson' is not appropriate. 

                 

Greg,

Sorry it took me so long to get this to you ( the perils of bid-week).

Call me if you need anything else.

Susan

Sorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.  Things have been 
very emotionally draining for me around here.  I'm going to forward some of 
my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.  After you've 
had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your 
opinion.  Call or email with any insights.

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there 
shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this 
point".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".  Kevin: "Much 
bigger and much better."  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
"dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a "hey" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

Bear in mind this next email wasn't sent until Friday afternoon (a full day

Hey,

I apologize for being out of touch recently but I was on vacation last week 
and this week has been busy.  Things seemed a bit awkward recently and I 
would like to see if we could get a beer and chat next week if you are free 
(after Tuesday night because I'll be in Amarillo talking to feedlot operators 
early next week). Enjoy your weekend and my condolences about UT's fall out 
of the top 10.

Ted

I haven't contacted him yet...what do you think?

I tell ya Mo, it's weird.

                   HOROSCOPE:      Weekly  

                   For September 25-October 1: Better
                   communication is indicated this week. Issues
                   that have bogged you down are effectively
                   addressed. Don't get up and leave until you get
                   every answer you need. Be direct and honest,
                   without losing your temper. Even if others
                   misbehave, continue pursuing what you believe
                   is right. An agreement is either out of balance or
                   no longer desirable. You CAN make
                   improvements to existing paperwork, contracts,
                   and agreements -- as long as you remain
                   friendly, respectful, and well-prepared. There
                   can be no hostility on your end, or negotiations
                   will break down. 

 
   
	

puh-lease!   i know i just emailed you, but i had to respond.  sometimes
it's hard for me to email back in a timely manner since, w/o a laptop, i
only have computer mon-thurs.  sue, PROMISE me you WILL not sacrifice your
integrity and allow him to weasle in just b/c he has a guilty conscience.
i'm pretty sure you won't, but i'm just imagining as i sit here the stories
your mom and dad have to tell.....and that's just the tip of the iceberg!i'm
a firm believer in the one strike and you're out thoery, and of course,
based on a, his behavior in the last few weeks, b., the sage words of his
'trusty' friend kevin, who DID give your parents the time of day, c., his
behavior steak nite, and d., HIS BEHAVIOR!!!!- i'd say he's been benched.  i
wouldn't rule out an 'explanation beer', but i thinks it's time to lower the
blow, so to speak, cut your losses, and run like hell....
e
  
	

i have to admit, when i saw the copyline for this, i began to panic.  i
pictured you in a drunken about- to-go-over the edge rage....and then ted
stumbling onto the scene, and you unloading.  however, in lieu of the facts,
i'd say this was an unequivicable 'victory', if such a word can be used....
i think it's fair to say that you ended up w/ more on your side of the
tug-of-war rope, so to speak.  and although it's frustrating to see what
once seemed to be 'potential' turn into shit, it's easier to walk away- at
least i'd imagine it to be.  sounds like you're going to have a whirl-wind
trip- guess enron only can open the gates of hell to let you out for brief
blocks of time......isn't that kind of like the myth about persephone
escaping from hades......?  will try to plan a suitable agenda- still in
ther 'dazed and confused' period- been more concerned w/ where i can find
trash bags than hopping bars so far, but will try to fine tune my skills in
the time remaining- must go to class, but will write more later.  hate to
say it, but you prob. will be saddled w/ a care package for me from mom-
will try to make it in the 80lbs or less range....

Em,

So, of course, I spent this whole past weekend trying to figure out how I 
want to handle this "situation".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over 

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  More importantly, do you think 
there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know 
this about me) I do believe in second chances.  That does not mean that a 
second chance is a given in this situation.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.  

Susan

- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.  This is a 
chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity 
even with my emotions on the line.  I think ultimately, regardless of the 
outcome, it will make me a stronger person.  By the way,  we will definitely 
cover the past relationships during this chat, that is a given.

   

puh-lease!   i know i just emailed you, but i had to respond.  sometimes
it's hard for me to email back in a timely manner since, w/o a laptop, i
only have computer mon-thurs.  sue, PROMISE me you WILL not sacrifice your

PS - I think I'm going to come over with Mom and Dad now in November.  I've 
been checking out airfare recently, ouch!  Anyway, I think were shooting for 
Nov. 9-14.  Talk to you soon.
 

   

I heard about the ongoing saga you are currently in
the middle of.  The nerve of that boy!  I think you
are right not jumping to return his e mail.  What a
coward, that he had to e mail you and didn't even have
the decency to call you.  What a weirdo!

It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the "Ted situation" 
- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

Susan

- - Deep down I think I knew there was something wrong with him.  I think 
that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, 
afraid of what I might find out).

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything. 

   
	
	

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

office Monday).  Thank you!

Here's an update, I sent this to Emily earlier today.  Let me know about this

was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there 
shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this 
point".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".  Kevin: "Much 
bigger and much better."  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
"dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a "hey" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was

What time are you heading out today?

Hey Wilson,

Steak night is on...And, yes Darren really did give me your keys and I've 
already handed them off to Ben.  Also, you'll be interested to know that my 
parents might make it tonight for a little while so you may get to meet 
them.  See you tonight.

Susan

Already done.

Susan

Thanks for the advice/humor.  I'm feeling much better today.  I knew 
yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication 
or lack thereof would speak volumes.  (And his silence definitely said a lot)

Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in 
said individual goes.  I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.  
Oh well, so I'm single again.  Just think how incredible it'll be when I find 
someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing 
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the 
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm coming 
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if 
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game 
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love 
to sit with you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hi Susan.

Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday.  I opened it in between
classes, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firm
until 11:00.  I will be glad when all of this is over.

The jury is split on what you should do.  Knowing myself, I would want to
know what happened...  i.e. what's the matter with him?  I think I would ask
him-- in a non-confrontational-- almost joking way-- like I didn't really
care either way but was just wondering-- why he stopped calling, etc.  I say
that, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that is
what I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do-- and this has
happened to me lots of times.  Usually, I just write the guy off as gay or
stupid...

Leslie (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) says
not to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.  Just act pleasant and
normal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one who
stopped the contact-- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.  I think
this is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell him
off won't eat at you.

Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.  Remember when
Michael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year?  First I called him and
told him off (Laura made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)for
about four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking Laura about
me.

In other words, both tactics are good.  I really think you ought to do what
makes you feel the best.  If you confront him, he might say something you
don't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.  If you
don't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and you
can feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...

If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).

Don't worry about it too much-- we should feel sorry for people who are
still confused about their sexuality at 31.  Isn't he a little old to be
living in the closet?

Let me know what happens.

- - You'll have to come up and visit 32 at some point.

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.  

Here are the email addresses again.  I'll shoot you off an email before I 
come over...hopefully, by that time you'll be somewhat settled and have a 
phone number where you can be reached.  Or, I may just see you at the 
office.  I have to pay a visit as there are a several people working over 
there now that I used to work with here (plus, I may try to set up a few 
interviews).

That actually made me cry.

Susan

Hey Corey,

So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?  Should 
I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between 
us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.  I am 
completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the 
situation the last two days.  Help!!!

Susan

Okay gang, it's time to rally the troops.  Evidently last week wasn't good 
for any of us to get together at our local watering hole (a.k.a Little 
Woodrow's)...but, I'm hoping the story is a little different this week.  Our 
own Nick Stephan is back in H-town for the week and has made a special 
request for a full-fledged "Steak Night" (that means good attendance).  Not 
that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company, steak, beer, etc. at LW's, 
but if I did I could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat.  
Besides, given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying, 
the picnic tables and deck are beckoning.  I'm going to set a tentative 
meeting time of 7:30 p.m. this Wednesday...get back to me at your convenience 
and let me know if we should stick with that time or not.  Hope everyone had 
a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).

Hey,

Try lgillet@enron.com for Lisa's email address.  Glad to hear you're in the 
new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the 
futon offer.  

Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a 
peep out of him).  I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.  On the 
one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't 
want to make this that easy for him.  I think I deserve more that just being 
swept under the rug.  So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all 
together OR do I try and get some resolution?  

I would love to get a call from you hear at work.  The best time for me is 
probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

   

hey- sent out group email this morn and lisa's address came back unsendable.

Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in London for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with 
one stone concept").  

Sue

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Darren 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.

Do tell, Do tell.

Darren,

What's the word?  So when do you head over to London and what pray-tell will 
you be doing over there.  I'm planning on going to visit Em and Katy around 
the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're 
going to be over there we need to all go out.  I don't remember if we ever 
talked about it or not, but I may try to do my third rotation there...the 
horror, Em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of London.  
Anyway, I'm assuming congratulations are in order, so congrats on the new 
assignment.

Here are Katy and Emily's email addresses.  I don't have phone #'s, etc. as 
of yet but I could get them for you if you'd like.  I'll be sure to shoot off 
an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there.

PS - We will definitely be doing Steak Night next week if you have any 
interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading 
credit derivatives in London...see how I'm hooking you up with all these 
connections) will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer.  
Besides, it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper 
send-off from Little Woodrow's (Now I going to owe you a Bon Voyage beer as 
well as a birthday beer).

Susan,
I will be going to London fro a few months on a project.  If possible, I 
would like
to get the information for the lovely ladies from Tomball and Cypress that 
are 
calling Britain home.  Please forward it to me when you get a chance.

--Darren

Steve and Frank, I would be very interested in your comments on the attached.

So who's up for doing something that Friday night?  I'll probably be in 
Austin Saturday for the football game, but am definitely interested in 
getting together with everyone.  Obviously this is planning WAY in advance 
for this group so we can revisit the topic when Wilson's arrival is a little 
bit closer.  Talk to y'all then.

Susan

* Darren - Please tell me you have Wilson's keys...Margaret and I would be 
eternally grateful.

Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you 
Em.

Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that 
I can at least spend a little time with Katy.  How will that work for y'all?

Sue

P.S. - Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted 
situation.  I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that 
whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.

Sunday at 1:00 is good with me as well.  Just name the place.

See you guys then.

Dear Recruiting Team Members:

I am forwarding a copy of the Enron presentation to each of you for review.  
Some of you will be asked to do presentations, many will not.  I just wanted 
to send it out to various team members in order to give you an idea of our 
marketing strategy and information on campus.  This is simply for your 
information.  When this presentation is given, it will include  dates 
tailored specifically for each campus based on the dates I have set up 
through career services.

Have a great day!

Aquarius 
      For September 14: You have a knack for bringing people together and
                     creating peace. Part of your success in waging peace is 
derived from a desire
                     to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe. 
You're sick and tired of
                     feeling sick and tired, and look forward to a refreshing 
sensation of starting
                     anew. Seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today.

boys suck!  i think we may have a comittment-phobe on our hands- ie, when
things actually progress, panick and back out- graceful or not- too intense!
  i should know, being one of them.....i know you're frustrated, confused,
angry and disappointed- but please bear in mind- this is the result of HIS
character flaws, not yours.  AND, as we've droned on and on about, we
shouldn't have to settle.  ever.  sue, you've just met mr. 90%- and isn't it
funny how that last 10% seems to mean EVERYTHING?!!!?  w/o being too abrupt,
as outside council i'd advise a serious fracturing of this 'relationship'.
he's given you no definition, very little respect, and enough mixed and
incomplete messages to keep you wondering and holding out for that perfect
sign, or comment that will make everything fall into place- NOT FAIR.
you're simply too good to tolerate that bullshit, and you'd be doing
yourself a disservice to stand for it.  i guess you kind of dictate how
people can treat you by what you're willing to put up with.  you're worth
alot more, and you're not desperate...lonely, maybe, but it's not the same.
ok- i'm getting angry just writing about this!  anyways- love my classes,
and london is really starting to grow on me.  so different and new- and
after a 30 min discussion about "those girls and guys" in texas w/ claudia,
and i'm more and more glad to be away from houston- present 'company' (+a
handful) excluded of course.  it's going to be a great adventure, and it's
nice to be reminded of how much more there is than texas, no matter how
great it is.  am looking forward to my new place (should be in this weekend)
and starting to travel.....can't wait for your visit- you'll like claudia-
she'll be a great partner in crime for going out, til you arrive, and the
circle widens, j'espere!  double check w/ kates about when she gets back
from egypt- i know she's gone over my b-day, so i hope she'll be back by the
time you get here.  plus, would be good for you to be here for her 'party'
at the texas embassy....must go to class, but hang in there, and start
thinking global...cheerio....

Hey Scott,

Hope you had a good time at the game this weekend, despite the heat.  I just 
wanted to see if you were still interested in trying to grab lunch this 
week.  If you do, just let me know what day and time work best for you.

Thanks, 
Susan

You crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your 
insight is frighteningly dead on).  

Don't worry about me though.  I will be patient and remain optimistic, 
despite let downs.  And, in no way, shape or form will I settle and end up 
with some dush.  You would have been proud of me though, for the first time I 
was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more 
vulnerable.  

I'm thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.  I think your attitude 
about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what 
happens when you care more about the other person than yourself). 

Talk to you soon,

Susan

* Be sure and let me know next time you're coming to Houston.  We'll go grab 
a drink and have a good talk.

Thanks for the email.  Your candid comments make me wish I was over there 
right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.  I am in full 
agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area 
in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put 
it, "He's just chicken-shit").  So, the plan of attack for the time being is 
none.  I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, 
no nothing).  Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an 
entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be 
the true test.  You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good 
support system in Monique.  She is a firm advocate of the "drop him and make 
him work should he happen to come crawling back" school.  You know what 
really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be 
disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about 
all the times I said "I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop." - well, 
it dropped) .  Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, 
exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind 
of working.  

I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.  You have to 
email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be 
enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick 
would put me up - scarey).  Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit 
so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.  FYI:  The Longhorns 
beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely 
HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.  
Talk to you soon,

Sue

*** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a 
shortcoming on my part.  I don't.  Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting 
the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I 
was, he freaked.  I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence 
that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding 
up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting 
aloof. (Things that make you go hmmm.)

Here's what I propose to send to the parties on the 14th.  Take a look, and 
think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first 
paragraph.  I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so 
that we have some time to approach individual parties first.  

With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also.

 

Hey Katy,

Sorry no correspondence in a while.  I wish it was a case of no news is good 
news, but if you've spoken with Em recently you know that is not so.  Anyway, 
I wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to London.  I of course 
want to try and time it when both you and Em are in town.  So...I was 
thinking of flying out on Oct 4 and returning Oct 9, that way I would have a 
weekend over there with y'all.  I know you're planning a trip to Egypt around 
then so just get back to me and let me know if you'll actually be in London 
any of those days.  Hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

Susan

Hey Darren,

Thanks for the prompt response.  Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I 
will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings 
(especially since I still owe you a beer).  Glad you liked the quote, it does 
provide a good chuckle.  

If I'd have known you were going to be in London this week I would have 
forewarned Katy and Emily as they're both over there now as well - I assume 
you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy.  Anyway, hope you're 
having a good time and not working too hard...

Susan,

Hope you are well.  Unfortunately I will not be able to participate.  
I will not return from London until Friday (maybe Thursday night).  
Keep me posted for the weeks ahead.  Love the quote--and I 
agree whole-heartedly.

--Darren

...okay, maybe it's not THAT good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful.

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

The one and only,

Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be 
kaput with Ted.  I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the 
other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have 
a chance to meet him while your in Houston.  Oh well, it was definitely fun 
while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just 
want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my 
language but the description fits).

But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well 
and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.  
We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana 
Lafayette).  Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 
1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Simms started the game but only 
played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put 
some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through 
a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys 
in the near future.

Write back soon,
Susan

So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Beaver Creek and 
writing this on the back of it...

I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy T-shirt.

Dont'cha love it?

I was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the earth...

It is definitely good to hear from you, I was just thinking about you today 
and wondering what you're up to.  Things in Houston are pretty good.  I went 
to San Diego over Labor Day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just 
went to Austin this past weekend for the first UT football game (I know 
you're not a big fan but they are very fun).  As for work, all is well.  I'm 
actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program 
to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up.  Of course 
my goal is to do a rotation in London for a year and then get promoted to the 
Associate program (so basically I'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what I 
need to do to ensure that outcome).  Honestly, I think my odds are pretty 
good.  

Glad to hear everything with you is going so well, not that I'm surprised.  
Congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up 
there (any trips scheduled to Houston in the near future?).

As for my social life...if you would of asked me a week or two ago I would 
have said fantastic, incredible, etc.  Now, I just don't know.  For the life 
of me I am never going to be able to figure out your gender.  But as they 
say, "Hope springs eternal" and I intend to remain an optimist despite many 
road blocks.

So what is going on...
I have not heard from you in a while and i'm  wondering how my favorite Enron 
"girl" trader is doing, and how the summer has been.
I know a lot has happen, i was hopping that you would bring me up to date 
with what is going on with you and work, and your social life. (Yes guys....)

I'm great....great summer. my best friend from france spend 2 1/2 month with 
me, (well stayed at my sisters place) and that was a lot of fun.
Work is great, though very strssful and demanding...very nerve recking..but i 
love and i'm making my marks where i can, and when i can. You know me.
I'm now Manager of Internet Marketing and Manager of Alliances...that's my 
new job also...

NewPower is doing great and you will hear a lot about us in the near 
future...Were live, so that's really cool.

Life is great, socialy i'm pleased and i love NY.
Big summer, like a little rock super star...and i've just started working out 
again this past week end, after a 3 month brake.
So just rolling along...
What's new

hope your well.

Hope your move into the new apartment went well.  I'm sure you are going  to 
have so much fun living there, especially since you really will have a 
roommate now.

Thought I'd give you a little bit of an update regarding Ted...

So I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday last week because I was in 
Austin Tuesday for that recruiting trip.  When I got in I of course 
immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have any messages at 
any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  Come Thursday afternoon, still 
no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he calls.  He asks me about 
San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.  We discuss 
UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up.  He informs me 
that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.  
While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little 
overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his 
vacation time.  He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been 
meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week 
had pretty much just been one long meeting.  It is around this time that he 
brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work 
when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.  As a 
result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. "I'm leaving 
tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."  I make sure I heard him 
correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at 
no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.  So, that was 
Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, 
to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's 
leaving (5:00 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week 
in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

Anyway, I was not able to get him out for a drink to find out what's going on 
and now I just have to wait.  Any thoughts?

Susan

Cynthia,

All of the deals below have been rebooked except for the one in red.  For 
some reason I can't find the counterparty in the system.  You may want to 
check and see if it has been set up yet, if it has let me know the proper 
name (I may be looking for the wrong counterparty) and I will rebook it as 
well.

Thanks,

Hi Susan:
Can you set up the counterparties for the 
following missing deals?  

NW8878 legs 5-8
NW8903 legs 5-6
NW9742 legs 3-4
NW9790 legs 1-2, 4
NX1037 legs 1-2
NX3659 legs 1-4
NX3790 legs 1-4

I don't know what you're schedule is and I
know that you're probably really busy.  But,
let me know when you would be able to 
set these up.  These are the leftover deals
from that original list that I submitted to you.
Thanks for all your help!  I am pulling across
all the new ones that you set up for me last week.
I really appreciate it!

Hey Em,

First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.  I took it 
twice.  The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a 
Mentor (like Matt)  I think I only changed two answers between the first and 
second test.  Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday 
morning.

I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.  I guess 
the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's 
apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.  Well, if 
you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which 
is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could 
go get a drink that night or not.  I knew he had his presentation that day so 
I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received 
no call, no email, no nothing.  Of course, always wanting to give others the 
benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than 
expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his 
friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he 
must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at 
work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he 
was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with 
me at all that day.  

Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until 
Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got 
in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have 
any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now 
Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he 
calls.  He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips 
were great.  We discuss UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get 
riled up.  He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard 
me corn) for Enron.  While he is very excited about trading I get the 
impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how 
much trading will limit his vacation time.  He said that he and Darren had 
been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the 
week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.  It is around 
this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a 
trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're 
closed.  As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. 
"I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."  I make sure 
I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 
days) AND at no point did he ask to get together before he left.  So, that 
was Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group 
and, to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when 
he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an 
attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?

On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 
so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding 
Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the 
mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going 
to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a 
crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little 
extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking 
of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him 
an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet 
though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just 
transplanted to a prettier location.

Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and 
I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk 
about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work 
for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge 
of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything 
I can to get over there and still get promoted.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas 
under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or 
periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar 
quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned 
maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that 
gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.  

Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm 
not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as 
the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not 
completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the 
tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either 
party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court 
or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if 
we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety 
rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure 
notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but 
simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, 
the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction 
provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under 
ordinary contract law.  

I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is 
going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed 
itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers 
reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate 
plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.

Cheryl,

The deal was done with one of the California Power Books.  We use the 
ECC/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Enron subsidiary...not just Canadian 
deals.  So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada 
office.  Let me know if you need more information.

Susan

Hi Susan

I am trying to verify the liquidations for financial close and noted that 
TAGG deal NK4420.1 entered by yourself
shows ECC (Enron Canada Corp) as the counterparty.

Here in Canada, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that 
the book PWR-NG-LTCA is a Canadian
book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be 
EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by
mistake to ECC.

Can you please look into this deal first thing Monday morning as we need to 
book the liquidations Monday am for
financial close and let me know what you think about this deal.

Thanks for your help.

Cheryl

Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the 
redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.  I am currently half-way through my 
second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea 
of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current 
rotation.  Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my 
next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 

Thank you,

I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
(as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the 
proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.

 Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 
prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC 
settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement 
conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in 
lieu of a redlined document.

 Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt 
point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt 
points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the 
Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt 
point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use 
of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of 
certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas 
transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no 
upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's 
system.

 Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain 
details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not 
been fully described in the CAC document.  To this end, Transwestern proposes 
that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda

Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new 
house in Hyde Park - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

Sue

First things first...

Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I 
think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for 
Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back 
Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.

Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.  Mine 
was incredible!!! I visited a friend of mine in San Diego and had the best 
time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony 
(on the water no less).  It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted 
has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.  I'm certainly 
not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a 
catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then 
I don't think he's bright enough for me).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey there. Are you still alive? What is up? How are things with you and 
Wonder Boy?
I think I will be in Houston Friday through Tuesday (maybe more days 
depending on how matters turn around). Will you be around?
Drop a note when you get a chance.

ok, i'm still forgetting people, so assure 'the others' i'm not snubbing
them intentionally, i'm just brain dead.  haven't gotten a chance to email
often b/c little access to the library, but will as soon as my computer
arrives, and you'll get more 'intimate' (pg-13!) messages when time permits,
until then.....hope all went well over the holiday weekend- no holiday here!
  school has started, and so far so good- very interntional class- but
strangely enough, one girl from san antonio who also wants to study art law-
and she wanted to escape " a bunch of incestual girls and guys who will
never leave home and never make new friends- just want to shop, get married,
and have babies" (not you ardie, don't be offended!)  i liked her instantly.
  still no permanent home.....will keep you posted.....but- bit of adventure
sunday- this stuff NEVER happens to me, so it made my month.
anyways....wandering by myself in chelsea on sunday and stopped to look in a
store window....wasn't paying attention when i turned around and brushed
against someone's shoulder- well- not just someone- BEN AFFLECK!  and with
gweneth paltrow (she looked like shit w/ long orange stringy hair and a kind
of whiney, hungry look on her face- he of course looked precious, but was a
little shorter than i'd expected- about 6'2)  i can't speak. and the road is
totally empty except us, so i just say excuse me, he says no problem, and
then just wander off, then turn to stare after them.  thought about chasing
them down, but realized how lame i already looked, plus, was in gym shorts
and pony tail and ratty sweatshirt, and knew ben COULDN'T realize i was "the
one" in that state....so, i ran to the nearest phone and called my mom.
well, that's about it- again. will write/call when get a spare sec.  miss
ya'll- write soon!

Sometimes I really worry about you...

I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I 
was rolling when I read your email.  It's a good thing I didn't send the 
other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of 
you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your 
shack last night).  So how did you explain your attire this morning to your 
MD? 

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

Hey,

Thanks for the card.  I got a good chuckle out of it.  You will appreciate 
this story.  I go to leave last night around 12:00 but somehow I don't have 
my keys.  Well, they were in my locker at the Met, which of course is closed 
at this point.  So, I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch.  Well, I try to 
sleep but his fire alarm keeps beeping ever 1-2 minutes and is really 
annoying.  So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with 
my leatherman tool.  Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and 
baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and 
shower/change.  Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on 
the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.  I finally arrive back at work around 
9:00 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.  I find this whole thing 
pretty funny and it is all due to my keen organizational skills.  I'll talk 
to you later.

Here is the Duke contract.

Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me 
after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a 
filing.  I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at 
Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher 
customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we 
work through Ms. Katz initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some 
inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work 
from when talking to Stefanie -- I put together the attached rough draft of a 
motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Sempra.  

Feel free to send the attached to Stefanie.  However, please do so with the 
caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal 
advice to Sempra from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this 
pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.

Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I 
don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.

i admit to being a little put-off by his 'tone'- if that's the correct word.
  you write a long, jovial, bantering note, and his response is cold and
blunt....it sounds like mr noble's project has zapped out all of his
personality......and we thought one of his better features was his
well-roundedness.....!  again , i think this is one of those subtle and
shaky things you can't really 'call' someone on, and it's best to leave the
ball in his court.  of course, if he comes around when he's less
'distracted', i would tread carefully, and w/ some aloofness- no reason you
should have to 'jump' when he says to! gauge how he acts post-holiday- there
will be no project excuse, and then you can see how much validity this
theory holds.  am completely disoriented right now- sleeping pattern is off,
have raging PMS, and am a little homesick, as i knew i'd be at first.  both
mom and dad  succeeded in slipping horribly weepy cards into my purse before
take-off (which was a weepy mess in itself).  of course, i found them on the
plane and made an absolute scene sniveling and crying big fat baby tears.
verrry attractive!  am going to be really glad actually when school starts
so that i can begin to get acclaimated and don't feel like such a fish out
of water.  need to finalize when you're thinking about coming over.....i
know it's sometimein oct- and kates said she has to leave on the 12th for a
wedding thing.  as i said, jeremy's wedding is the weekend of the 14th, and
i know that was a week you discussed coming.  i don't have tickets, but if
it's physically poss for me to find a good ticket home, i prob. will have
to- gogo started crying when i said i prob. couldn't come, and i promised
i'd try.  but then again, i don't want to mess up the vacation plans you've
been setting up for a long time.  hopefully we can find a 'mutually
beneficial' time for the visit- let me know what you're thinking, and we'll
work from there!  am writing from the computers at katy's school, and don't
know how long i am allowed to, so will try to check back asap!  hope all is
well- miss ya'll!

Em,

Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home.  I'm sure you'll be 
adjusting to the time change for a few days, but hopefully this time you 
won't get sick.  Say, "Hi" to Katy for me and tell her I will email her soon 
to try and figure when is the best time to come visit.  

Now on to the business at hand.  Thought I'd let you see the last email 
exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.  Start from the bottom with my email 
and then read his response.  I would love to hear your insight on it all.

Here's my thought at this point.  I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, 
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at 
once.  To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many 
hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.  Realizing this, I'm not 
sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?

Hey Shorty,

I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.  We are getting a tad 
busy.  I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of 
cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.  A 
drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work 
to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) 
and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.  I think the story 
below is funny.  I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is 
going on.

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.

Julie,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to 
be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I 
am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of 
shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My 
guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in 
Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I 
say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the 
polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would 
definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I 
go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some 
other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good 
seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 
9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days 
to work with. 

Love,
Susan

-- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack 
depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross 
overpacking...Thanks.

Can we keep the upside -- I believe the answer is clearly "no" unless/until 
we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing.  Til then we're 
bound by the billing provisions on Sheet 95H.
Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting 
out there a while...

As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff 
language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement 
shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and 
the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing 
shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.  I know Lindy has some 
clear ideas on what we want here... we can discuss more if you like.  

The offer still stands but the location has changed...We're meeting at the 
Gingerman instead of Kenneally's (so alas no pizza - but oh, what a selection 
of beer).

feelings of guilt.  Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your 
presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend 
at Kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer.  Let me know if you have 
any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck

Do we need to talk?

Julie,

Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.  I would 
love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc.  I've 
made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.  I'm going 
to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails 
because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.  Anyway, 
like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe 
me it's much needed).  

Susan

I'll give you the exact times tomorrow, but my flight gets in around 9:00 
a.m. on Saturday and doesn't leave until around 6:00 p.m. on Monday.  Talk to 
you tomorrow.

Read it and weep...Just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back 
with me in case you don't make it out there this weekend.  I'm thinking I may 
need to get Julie to hook me up with a job like hers...if it will allow me to 
live like we're evidently going to this weekend.

Shorty

HI Susan-

I'm so excited for your visit this weekend!  Whenever you get a chance, let
me know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can plan
around them both....

I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we could
spend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center near
me, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, and
possibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.  Which of these interests
you?  Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while in
town?  The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anything
else?  Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman is
coming to my house!  We'll each get a 30 minute massage....I think this
will be great quality, girl time!  I've missed our shopping binges!

Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait to
hear how everyone in your life is doing.  Weather has been beautiful as
usual- about 75 degrees and perfect.  In the evenings it gets cool enough
to wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrow
something from me, too.

The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.  I've been living there for
a year and am moving out in 2 weeks.  I could have moved out this Labor Day
weekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were in
town.  So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back another
time when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm moving
into- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.

See you soon!
Julie

This one kind of gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  Knowing that you 
are benefiting mankind by working for the Big "E".  

You mock what you don't understand.....The Dyner will do the same deal 3 
years from now, but LOSE $666trillion, and call it revolutionary and 
strategic to their business.

what's going on over there.................

Cinderella in Her Later Years.......

Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella said "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??"

The Fairy godmother replied "Well Cinderella, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

"I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension." Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.

Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said "Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother".

The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?" Cinderella looked down at her frail body,
and
said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says";
"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man".

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Cinderella.

Enjoy your new life." And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into
each
other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

"I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"

I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, 
that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.  
However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does "voluntary" 
mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission 
here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on 
establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is 
from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.

Comments?  

Agustin,

You are right, the correct deal number for Industrias del Etileno is just 
NW9742 (legs 1 & 2).

I will be able to attend and am going to try to get to Austin in time for the 
faculty lunch.  I will let you know if I can make the lunch for sure after 
I've worked out my travel arrangements. 

Thanks,
Susan

Okay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to 
be like that for about the next three years.  However, this season will give 
us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the 
necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from 
now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1 
recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the 
future looks bright for the Longhorns.  Besides, our stadium's on campus and 
we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun 
regardless of how weak the opponents may be.

Counter?

Hey Shorty,

Sorry your week has been going poorly (I guess you feel like I did Wednesday 
night).  But on the bright side, college football starts this weekend which 
is always a plus and today is Friday which makes this bad week over.  I am in 
middle of packing once again for another move but the good news is that I get 
kicked out by 5:00 today.  I was checking out UT schedule and it looks like 
they have a pansy schedule (unlike UCLA that has to play Alabama #3 and 
Michigan #4 early in the season).  Any comments on that?

was better and that you made a full recovery from Steak Night.

Well, this may go down as one of my absolute worst weeks ever.  Hope yours 
was better and that you made a full recovery from Steak Night.

Sorry I didn't get a chance to buy you a beer last night - we got there 
late.  I owe you one.  Hope you had a great birthday.

Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night.  I had to work late last 
night...Big Shock!!!  Anyway, hope it was fun and that you're having a great 
week.  Mine has been pretty busy work wise.  I'm sure you're curious about 
Mr. Noble.  All I can say right now is that, while I definitely still like 
him (we had a great time Sunday), I am some what annoyed with him right 
now...he's been very wishy-washy the first half of this week.  I'm not real 
sure what I'm going to do about it, but I'm sure I'll think of something.

Fly me to the moon.

Lesli,

I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below.  
Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to 
be rebooked as soon as the CP's are set up.  If you could just let me know 
when the new CP's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.

Thanks,

Same dude...and he is good.  We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little 
Woodrows which of course makes me happy.  Also, I just sent him a list of all 
the UT games so he can start planning to attend.  As soon as he decides on a 
first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and 
others.  That's a lot of prep work.

   

How's the new dude?

Your own personal palm pilot hard at work.  As promised, here's a list of 
UT's games this season...color coded for your convenience of course.

* Home games are in burnt orange...what else?

I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.

The counterparty for that deal is Enron Omaha and the contact is Larry 
Paulou.  I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the 
counterparty as New this morning.  Let me know if there is anything else you 
need.

Susan, Joe,

The referenced TAGG # was entered as a 'New Counterparty', can you please let 
me know what counterparty this is so we can correctly assess the counterparty 
exposure.

Thank you,

Russell

Hey there yourself,

Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I 
am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at 
exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we 
would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.

As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all 
this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day 
last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not 
quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes 
things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but 
Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if 
we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair 
that is a U.T. game).

Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her 
Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm 
going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter 
Julie.  Needless to say I am very excited.

Talk to you  guys soon,
Susan

   

Hey girlie,

How are you doing?  Haven't heard from you in a while.
 A little birdie told me that you were checking into
tickets for Seoul.  Are you really?  Would you come
with your parents or separately?  In any case, we have
had some more time to do some exploring (and
shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do
if you come.  I think that we will stay in Korea when
your parents come and do the whole base thing (which
will take only a few minutes, actually), but are
considering going to China or somewhere during part of
Thanksgiving.  We'll do whatever you want want if you
still are coming!

Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's
going on in Houston.

Take care,
Chris

Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in 
this case the Big D)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.

Shorty

-- Due to the lack of response yesterday, I'm beginning to worry about your 
success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around 
to it.

Ted Noble
08/17/2000 10:05 AM
How was the play?  I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run 
Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30.  
Smart girl.  I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Darren.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you later.

Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think 
you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start 
pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having 
driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to 
pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up 
failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the 
memory of an elephant).  

I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 
32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know 
that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing 
just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and 
your needs.

Ted Noble
08/16/2000 10:56 AM
AAAAAGGGHHHHHH...I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam 
both written and on the rode.  This is a two day process and all because I 
let my CA license expire.   I know I need some of your organizational 
skills.  I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get 
moved to 30 (I better not fail it). How's life on 32 today -- well that's 
enough about you let's talk more about me.

There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do
and not doing it. -Mary Little

Hey,

My week is actually going very well so far (my trader left around noon so 
today should be a piece of cake).  I know you
guys have been working really hard the last couple of days, but I hope it 
paid off and the presentation went well 
yesterday.  However, given your comment about y'alls idea getting the axe in 
the short term, I'm not sure that was 
necessarily the case.  Anyway, I'm sure at least your steak dinner was a hit 
(so were you able to resist the red wine 
this time, you lush?).  

In keeping with my very serious nature (yes, you heard me serious), I've 
attached little story for you...I got a pretty
good chuckle out of this one.

PS. - Thanks again for carting me around and feeding me Saturday...I, as 
usual, had a great time.  Oh, and by the way, kudos to both of us for 
actually making it through a home movie

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted

I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and 
Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car 
dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the 
dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you 
an out.  I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how 
important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your 
needs."  Just let me know.

FYI:  Galveston does not look like this...

Hey Hot Stuff,

I know how much you love these spoofs so enjoy.  Hope your having a good day 
or at least, given the circumstances, a tolerable one.

I don't know what your talking about...

(By the way, thanks for the public outing.)

Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and 
executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million 
of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.

The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of 
$0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net 
present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be 
$188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated 
(I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to 
agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the 
project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for 
this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to 
James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know 
what he says.

Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am 
very afraid and yet undaunted.

Do me one last favor and tell Darren I said he's a real funny guy and that 
there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back.

Ted Noble
08/02/2000 01:01 PM
I just don't know where to start with the last couple of sentences so I will 
let any jokes pass for now but be afraid.  As for the people on the list, I 
know them as follows:

John Massey: SMU, UT b-school, emissions trader and a funny guy - spent a few 
drunken nights with him and he lives in your complex
Milind Pasad: India, UT b-school, really nice guy but no drinking or meat 
eating (he drove me to get my car on Monday)
Kevin Ruscitti: UCLA mba and trades gas, nice guy
Claudio Riberto: works in my old group with Milind, very smart MIT mba nice 
but quiet

I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, just let me know you 
little hottie.

Along those same lines, did you get them to bring the car to you here or do

My car actually works.  Can you believe it.  Now I can take you to movies and 
we can actually watch them but somehow I think watching a movie at home is 
just a tad more fun.

Evidently, in order for us to actually watch a movie we have to physically go 
to the theatre.  Somehow we keep missing that critical step in the home 
viewing experience...namely the viewing.

I've managed to "handle" myself for almost 24 years just fine, thank you very

Okay, okay...The real Susan is back.  So, do you think I should sport the

By the way, your personal taxi service is on call Sunday  so just let me know 
when you need to be picked up (you're flying out of intercontinental, right?).

I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim 
Sunday. (Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much 
"cooler" than mine.)

-- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last 
night.  You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or 
you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a 
valiant effort).

Hey Handsome,

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked 
against me.  Anyway, I'm going to say that as it stands right now 8:00 p.m. 
is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate 
when we get closer to 4:30 p.m. and I have a better idea where I stand.  
Don't let them work you too hard down there...remember, your body's not used 
to it.

Hey Shorty,

How is your day going?  Hopefully, it is going well.  Let me know when you 
think you will be free tonight to go home, relax and then be ready to head 
out.  I will make the reservations accordingly.  I'll talk to you later.

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

Ted,

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

Shorty

FYI - U.T. plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)

Ted,

My day is going quite well, actually.  I managed to sleep in past 6:30 a.m. 
this morning and did not work-out so I'm feeling pretty good.  I'm not sure 
if I'll be able to respect you in the light of your "rule-breaking", but I'm 
going to try to look past that.  I'm heading to lunch right now - yes, I am 
actually leaving the building - so the day just keeps getting better and 
better.  As for last night, I had a really good time too and am glad you were 
able to look past my bad manners and agree to go out Friday.  Talk to you 
soon.

Susan

Shorty,

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the "rules" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

Ted

Sounds good to me...Coincidentally, a made service will be coming to clean my 
car this evening

Let's plan on heading over there around 8:00-8:30 so there is absolutely no 
hurrying after work.  Steak night is a time of leisure so take all the time 
you need to get home, change and relax before heading out.  I live at the 
Park at River Oaks (West Alabama & Buffalo Speedway on Buffalo Speedway--from 
your place just take a right on Buffalo Speedway and its the first place on 
your left) and the only entrance has a guard and he will call up to my place 
to let you in.  Park at any labelled guest spot (left side of the up ramps 4 
floors) and my place is #3309 - closest building to the corner of Buffalo 
Speedway and West Alabama.  Now I am really tired from all this typing.

Ted

By the way, a maid service is coming to clean my place tomorrow afternoon.  
Quite a coincidence ... hmmm

Hey Math-Wiz,

I completely understand your plight.  I too am suffering a two o'clock, 
post-lunch slump (the coffee is simply not working at this point).  Anyway, I 
think a change of clothes prior to Steak Night is probably a good idea.  
Also, driving tomorrow is not a problem... just let me know the gate code, 
apt. #, etc.  Along those same lines, what time did you want to head over 
there?  (For better-safe-than-sorry reasons, due to my job, I think no 
earlier than 7:30 p.m. is our best bet.)

Hope you're having a lovely day and don't work too hard (Ha!!).

I hope your day is going well.  We took our MD out for lunch because he is 
relocating to NY and will spend about a week in Houston a month.  Well, to 
make a short story long, we ate at Erma's (great food) but I am getting very 
sleepy (life is difficult I know) from eating way too much.  I assume we are 
going home to change into some casual/hot weather clothes before dinner 
tomorrow and I may need you to pick me up.  I am still looking for some good 
jokes that I can send to you that are funny but still moderately appropriate 
(most are completely inappropriate - I have sick friends).  Check out 
www.darwinawards.com for some funny but true stories.  I'll talk to you later.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a 
non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the 
race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple 
classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.

-- I'm intrigued...what exactly is the Hawaiian Biker ensemble?

Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction 
mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation 
would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues 
generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical 
threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes 
for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold 
were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the 
total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed 
cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to 
Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its 
minimum pay obligation for a particular month.

This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed 
it.  FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it 
created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly 
discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an 
analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market -- the 
Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy 
nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much 
firm capacity was available.

I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to 
file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get 
FERC to accept it.  

That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 
to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 
1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).

Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and 
Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).  As for the hat/casual 
western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin 
Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia.

Just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get 
a hold of you and make life less than pleasant.  How a person can be in 
Hilton Head, SC and still sound like he's going to have a heart attack is 
beyond me.

Hey yourself, 

Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is 
out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning 
to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to 
know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my 
roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night 
sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  

Susan

Hey,

I hope your day is going well.  I will be in Colorado Wednesday through the 
weekend, so I want to see if you were free to see The Perfect Storm before I 
leave on my mini-vacation.  These 3 and 2 day weeks are really getting too 
much. Just let me know if your schedule is free for a 9:00 show either 
tonight or tomorrow and I'll talk to you later.

Ted

Ted, 

I spoke with Shanna a little while ago about your friend and the apartment 
and she said she was fine with the deal.  Talk to you later.

Susan

Ted,

Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of 
indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start 
the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my 
sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before 
heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the 
least I could do.  

After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this 
weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am 
having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.

Susan,

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Ted  

Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2" - 6'3"
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots." 
  "Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married."
  "Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met."
  "I really want to learn how to two step."
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Hey Susan,

What's with this new man who keeps popping up
everywhere?  I heard you have seen a lot of him
lately!  You'll have to e mail me back and fill me in
on the scoop.

We had a great time in Thailand.  They are right when
they say it is exotic.  We saw some pretty ronchy
things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old
men with the young boys and a million of those clubs
or if the clubs "featuring" women were worse.  Anyway,
we got to see and do some pretty interesting things
and ate some really good food.  Chuck is expanding his
palate (sp?).  Hope all is well in Houston!

Hey Ted,

Just wanted to check and see if you guys are still going planning on going 
tonight.  We have been having some major systems issues today so I'm about to 
really throw myself into my work in an effort to get out of here at a 
reasonable time.

Susan

Yes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.  
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the 
words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds 
good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be 
able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that 
Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any 
bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it 
should a good group.

Susan

Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to 
share.   

Susan 

This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there 
exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you 
nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.  So...I thought I should let 
you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.  
Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00.

Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the 
rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days 
they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component 
(using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 
and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that 
make sense to you?

   
	
	

OK?  Is the per unit rate for the Cal Border deliveries kosher on a firm 
contract?  DF

The man who thinks he can do without the world is indeed mistaken; but the
man who thinks the world cannot do without him is mistaken even worse.

                  You may know today's word as a generalized term for anyth=
ing
                  unusual, but "weird" also has older meanings that are mor=
e
                  specific. "Weird" derives from the Old English noun "wyrd=

                  essentially meaning "fate." By the late 8th century, the=

plural
                  "wyrde" had begun to appear in texts as a gloss for=20
"Parcae,"
                  the Latin name for the Fates -- three goddesses who spun,
                  measured, and cut the thread of life. In the 15th and 16t=

                  centuries, Scots authors employed "werd" or "weird" in th=
e
                  phrase "weird sisters" to refer to the Fates. William
                  Shakespeare adopted this usage in Macbeth, in which the

ARIES

                   HOROSCOPE:   Weekly   

                   For May 2000: Reassess your goals and
                   friendships. Things have changed. Are you
                   satisfied with your job, relationships, and
                   immediate future? May brings things to light
                   that have been buried or disguised. Take a
                   cool calm steady look at what surfaces. . . and
                   decide if a change in direction is warranted.
                   It's clear that your work scenario needs
                   refurbishing and your daily schedule cries out
                   for major rehab. But first and foremost, you'll
                   get your second wind by dropping tension
                   and frustration mid month, increasing the
                   probability for better relations with friends,
                   coworkers, and relatives. Try to establish
                   healthy, positive change no later than the Full
                   Moon. Take steps to insure your financial and
                   business future on or before May 28.

AQUARIUS

                   HOROSCOPE:    Weekly 

                   For May 15-21: You're moving away from one
                   base of operations into another. Your
                   priorities and basic requirements are also
                   shifting. You find yourself relying less on
                   something you've clung to in the past -- and
                   moving closer to something newer, fresher,
                   and more invigorating. You've got a rage to
                   live and a burning desire for peak
                   experiences. Middle of the road choices
                   won't do it for you. Your hankering to push the
                   envelope could get you into hot water with the
                   old guard and certain close associates or
                   relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of
                   being replaced. But the genie is already out
                   of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what
                   you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on
                   its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to
                   enjoy the ride. . .

I'm a little uncomfortable with saying "TW defers to the consensus position 
of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say 
anything on those items?  Or say TW has no comment at this time.  Would the 
other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

Jeffery Fawcett
02/28/2000 03:43 PM
Attached see my marked-up version of your work product.  Mark, I think you 
did an excellent job of identifying TW's position in all of the issue in the 
GIR.  However, on editing, you'll see that I truncated some of the TW 
comments in favor of a slightly shorter document -- particularly in those 
areas in which it was questionable whether we have a direct interest or not.  
Look over and give me your feedback.  Thanks.

I understand we're supposed to offer these comments to Craig as soon as 
possible for possible inclusion in a 2nd generation "issue matrix?"

Je pense que je suis un plaisir a est vers.  (Mes excuses, le net send ne

definite romantic bent to her works, but in addition their is amazing insig=

two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each other=

minds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that=20
constituted the norm for that time.

Just wanted to thank you all for showing my parents such a good time last 
night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some 
faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love 
this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat 
though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the 
topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night".  Our own, though 
at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.

Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my 
selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly 
unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

"Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- 
Dorothy Thompson

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school 
and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of 
the value of the result to the community." -- Albert Einstein 

"Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but 
among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh." --W.H. Auden

"Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else." -- 
Steven Ouellette

"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy." -- Florence Scovel 
Shinn

"We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret or disappointment." -- Jim Rohn

Sorry I didn't return your call last night, Lisa and I went to hear Julie 
Andrews speak at Jones Hall and didn't get home until after 10:00 p.m.  
Knowing what a precious commodity sleep is I refrained from possibly 
disturbing your own.

"The greatest good we can do for others is not to share our riches with them, 
but to reveal their own." - Author Unknown 

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most
 important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work,

"1. Do what's right. Be on time, be polite, and be honest; remain free from 
drugs; and if you have any questions, get out your Bible. 
2. Do your best. Mediocrity is unacceptable when you are capable of doing 
better. 
3. Treat others as you want to be treated. Practice love and understanding." 
           -- Lou Holtz (Three rules for success)

Pursuant to your request, attached is a very plain-vanilla motion to 
intervene out of time and motion to expedite that you can provide to your 
non-Gallup customers if you like.  If you do so, please inform them that we 
are not providing this as legal advice but merely as an example, and whether 
they choose to file in this proceeding and the content of what they file is 
up to their own respective legal and regulatory departments.

Where were you last night?

Tell Lisa that EOL sucks...I've had to rebook 40 screwed up deals...hope to 
be there by 7:00

Turns out my boss is going to get to Teala's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to 
show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Ben, 
Nick and possibly Sunil are planning on going so you may want to see when 
they are planning on getting there.

I'm finally having my going away Happy Hour with my old group tonight so I'm 
out.   Sorry.  Hope you guys have fun (Don't forget Woody's is a cheese-fest)

Christa Winfrey
05/04/2000 03:29 PM
A couple of us were thinking about meeting somewhere tonight (other than 
Woody's).  Anyone else up for it?

I too enjoyed our talk last night ( I'm always interested in other 
viewpoints, it is only by examining them that we challenge our own).   

  The Happy Hour tonight is at Teala's on West Dallas.  My recommendation is 
that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.  Hopefully by that time my old 
manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on 
his tab.

I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.

P.S. Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated 
with.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/04/2000 01:42 PM
yo  there...good talk last night.
There is something i appriciate abuot you which is your willingness to put 
yourself on the line...I find that to be a quality.
Anyway, I might be living this week end, though i would come back next 
friday, but then i would go to NY for that weekend...Ben's BBQ
Yeha i've got two days of meeting in  NY and then somwhere down south with my 
new boss.
traveling all week...loving this already.
Also i just filled out a American Express coportate card app..(VP and higher 
are priviledge to that, keep it a secret)
I love this job...
What is the plan tonight, what is the party about...
let me know

While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.

give me your phone number in the bulding?

I'm sure we can find you a ride over there.  What time do you think you're 
going to be finished-up here?

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/03/2000 05:27 PM
this weather really sucks....
i just finished working out...and got some shit to finish here...
but still wondering about tonight, cause if it rains i have no way of getting 
to little woodrows...

Are you still going to run?

I have purchased 4 tickets to Saturday night's show.  Maybe we can all go out 
to dinner before-hand or I wouldn't mind having everyone over to my place for 
a little wine and food?  Also, I don't think I can make this week's Tasters 
dinner because my old group is having a belated going away happy hour in 
honour of me.  PARTAY!!!

I have not yet received your comments to the Monthly Report, which is 
attached below.  Please send your comments to me (not Emily) as soon as 
possible.  If you do not have comments this month, please let me know so that 
I can mark you off the list.  Thanks very much! :)

	
	

Attached is November's Monthly Report.  I know I'm asking for your revisions 
to it earlier than usual, but with everyone being out during the holidays 
(myself included) we decided it would be easier to incorporate changes you 
make to this report into the Weekly so you only have to update one report.

Denise Lagesse is going to do the updates next week for me while I'm on 
vacation so send your changes and new items to her by Friday, December 
17th.....Thanks....and Merry Christmas everybody......!!!!!

As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 
250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion, 
Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to 
Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total 
of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:  
40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be 
present.

Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers 
would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence 
of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at 
PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a 
reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought 
by a shipper.  

More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a 
reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm 
shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is 
entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed 
quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a 
refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities 
for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper 
from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide 
service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed 
would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, 
for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the 
shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be 
recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such 
damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate 
points if capacity is available at such points.

Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.  
I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential 
damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the 
Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a 
meeting time for next week.  Thank you.

By the way, when are you leaving for NY/moving all of your stuff?  And, 
when's your last day at the Big "E"?

I will most likely have a good headstart by the time you get there.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/03/2000 01:11 PM
i'm going running for sure at memorial park tonight...so i'd say latest 
8pm....

What time are you thinking about getting over there?

It is tonight and it looks as though we will have great weather.  I'm 
planning on getting there ASAP as I've had a rough week already and need some 
beer in a bucket.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/03/2000 10:28 AM
hey is tonight little woodrows or is that tomorrow?

I apologise for the delay in my response to your email.  Thank you for 
contacting me regarding the rotational opportunity in your group.  While it 
sounds intriguing, I will not be able to pursue it as I have already begun my 
second rotation with ENA.  However, I would appreciate the opportunity to 
learn more about your group and any possible future rotations.  Please let me 
know if you would be able to meet at some later date.  Thank you again.

04/27/2000 04:15 PM
Susan,

I received your resume from the analyst/associate pool and understand that 
you will be rotating soon.  I'm a manager for EES Europe looking for an 
analyst to be  based in Houston who can join within the next two months.  If 
you have an interest in discussing this opportunity, please call me so that 
we can set-up a time to talk.

I've called and checked before and evidently the steak cook comes rain, 
sleet, snow or hail.  So unless everyone's opposed to eating inside, if it's 
raining, we can go no matter what.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/02/2000 04:51 PM
yeah i guess so...Anyone who care bare being around me i guess
if you find any hot girls let me know...
But basicaly the regular...need to make sure it's not raining !

Who all would you like on your guest list for tomorrow?  Regular crew?

I may have to start training now for that.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/02/2000 01:11 PM
Yes coming to visit in NY will be a must and i'll take you out, with my Boyz, 
and show you a little what partying, drinking and going all out is all about.

In honour of your departure I think it is only right that we do "Red Meat" 
one more time.  I feel as though I've said this a lot lately 
but...Congratulations.  I don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it 
over and over again so just know that I am completely sincere when I say it.  
The money sounds fantastic, although I hope that aside from the money you 
enjoy and are challenged by your new role.  I may not know you inside and out 
but I do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment 
to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will 
provide that for you.  Also, the step up position-wise is great and I think 
deserved.  As far as being scared goes, that'll be our little secret.  You do 
know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that 
extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done.  

I guess this means I'll have a good excuse to visit NY.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
05/02/2000 12:37 PM
I guess we should do  red meat one last time before i leave.
I got the official offer on Paper, and well...i'm blown away.Couldn't sleep 
last night
I'm now a manager..yeah you heard me right.
I'm Manager of Internet Marketing...WOW...and well the money..Well you can 
ask around you what Manager make, i blew past the 100K, like a crazy ".com" 
myself....I'm excited and scared, yes scared...i'll admit, but don't tell 
anyone.
SO i'm a little confuse on some things such as when i'm actually moving to 
NY, but Im in NY for Work next week.
So it will happen fast and i'm out of Enron this week.
That's the news...

Sure, why the heck not.

   

Please let me know ASAP if you can attend a Happy Hour this Thursday in your 
honor (at Teala's on W. Dallas).

MM

Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.

With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to 
rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable 
leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective 
restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain 
alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the 
segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan 
to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement 
argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including 
our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to 
mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).

On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place 
on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal 
rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would 
see them as two separate kinds of service.

As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has 
offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a 
presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the 
order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due 
until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until 
September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply 
not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized 
presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the 
planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In 
the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer 
them.

Christine Stokes
03/02/2000 10:32 AM
Thanks Susan for the 637 summary.  Here are a couple of items that I need 
additional clarification on:

1)  Segmentation -  You summarized " Pipelines must allow segmentation to the 
extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff 
provisions ...  "    Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California 
contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by 
the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio 
to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?  If they 
could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 
MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or 
would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?      
Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this 
segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20 
specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper 
will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if 
these paths are not already provided as "alternate" receipt or delivery 
paths?  

2)  Peak & OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized " The policy does not apply to 
long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of 
service."   

 TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most 
interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or 
the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.  Most likely these 
contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even 
seasonal.  I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect 
from the marketplace.

Thanks for your feedback.  Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to 
be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more 
critical issues.  Thanks.

O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know 
if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the 
tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to 
remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I 
think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your 
ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email 
and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise 
I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in 
the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having 
a wonderful day.

I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  

Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.

Again Mark I am flattered that you include me in these explanations...but I 
don't really need them anymore.

The 5 day loss violation resulted from long outright WTI position (Jun00  
NYMEX curve down $1.39/bbl from 4/24  to  4/26) and long outright Propane 
position (Apr00 Propane curve down $.52/bbl 4/20 to 4/27).  

Please call with questions

Ben was actually already planning on going.  In fact he informed me he would 
be bringing a friend from Canada.  

FYI - I didn't know there was a "friend" in Canada until very recently 
(although I had my suspicions) and further more had never heard a name until 
today.  Regardless, any friend of y'alls is a friend of mine.  Also, Nick is 
going to bring Amy (his significant other).  

Should be an interesting evening.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/26/2000 04:58 PM
i'll be there on time for a good steak...did you invite Ben?

It looks like people are going to start arriving around 7:00 so I'd say just 
show up after your done running and getting all pretty.  I'm sure we'll all 
be there till at least 10:00.

So are you going tonight or not?

You're the greatest.  

I think Little Woodrow's is on for tonight although I'm still waiting to see 
if my brother and his wife want to go out tonight (he leaves for South Korea 
Sunday), if they're a no go I will be on the deck with a bucket of beer.  

P.S. You are in peak physical condition.

i believe that in the spychology of things and oneself, a person never has to 
lose, and can always win somehow and in someway...
I have made very big sacrifices and have done some rather "not Nice" 
things...to win
True i have not often lost...losing is a frame of mind and a way of thinking, 
the question is, have i always been the best i could be and on that end, 
well....Yeah i rarely lose...i don't see why one would want to.
But i have been beaten by people even when i gave my best in sports mainly 
and then their are always smarter people..so
it's relative...
Ture i am the most looked at guy at memorial park, and i can't figure out if 
i actually enjoy it or not, because i know my true self, and the reality..i 
have no friends, and i go to bed by myself everynight...i'm a very lonely 
person at heart and in my head, and well beside Shannon
most girls i have dated, though pretty, are not hotties, but rather have a 
lot of charme and personality..and 
oh more more honest coment, i don't actually have an opinion on my looks...i 
don't really care....(but i do know about my body! and yeah few come close)
there

Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
  
  I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one 
important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I 
would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could 
be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one 
is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy 
gets really old and slow.

Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not 
identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?

well he was with her...his ugly...what the hell....
and i'm always up for a challenge and because i have alwyas been the under 
dog, my first true assumption is that everyone can beat anyone.
That's what i think inside, now what i show and tell is different...I don't 
lose and no you are not a the level that you could beat me...
hihi
and i go run at 5:30pm, cause like that i can look at girls...

No I'm not close b/c I can't take off 2hrs from work to go run in the park.  
However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count 
for extra.  Besides when did this become a contest I wouldn't think you'd 
consider me a worthy adversary... at least not yet.  I do know the model 
you're speaking of, but isn't she married to some billionaire in Venezuela?

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/26/2000 01:23 PM
so i'm already up to 15 miles runing for this week....
Are you even close....and i'll be adding another 6 miles today...my legs do 
hurt i will admit!

Hi Purvi.

Sorry to only come to you when I have a problem, but I've noticed a large 
increase in the number of Gas Daily Deals that fail to pull into our 
Reporting Database.  Could you tell me which Post ID these deals are in and 
when they were booked?  I would really appreciate your help.

Thanks for your help,

Carrie

How was NY?

Just wanted to ease your mind and let you know that I have not discussed your 
impending move with anyone save those you have already informed.  I am well 
aware of the sensitivity of the subject.  Believe it or not, sometimes I am 
able to keep my mouth shut. 

Ginger,  I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday.  
However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my 
attendance.  If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the 
caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the 
opportunity.  Please let me know if this is all right and I will do 
everything I can to attend.

   
	
	

The Analyst Program will be holding a meeting focusing on branding for 
recruiting brochures, content, website, and marketing materials.  Along with 
program management, David Bloom and Michelle Staley from Brecker & Merryman

initiative.  You are invited to participate in this meeting, this Thursday, 
April 27 2:00 - 4:00 pm, location 44C1.  Conference call number/connection 
can be arranged for those individuals out of the Houston area.  Please let me 
know if you are able to participate.

Thank you

What is it about the two of you that you think I can't handle?  And believe 
me I am making efforts to enlist worthy participants.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/19/2000 02:28 PM
are you saying it's just the three of us?
which is fine with me..
but i don't know if you can handle Ben and I on a good day

Our regular Wednesday night crowd will be somewhat diminished.  However the 
most important individuals will be present...Us.

Who's picking on me?

I'll see what I can do but most of my girlfriends live in other cities and 
besides who wants to expend energy entertaining second string candidates?

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/19/2000 01:49 PM
thanks////hey, if you know any girls...you should invite them. Maybe everyone 
won't be picking on you so much, if it's not a sausage fest everytime

I'm not going to take any lip from you.  The name is Little Woodrow's and 
it's on W. Alabama just off of Kirby.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/19/2000 01:37 PM
you need to tell me the name of the thing for me to invite people...you 
invite the guys that usualy come and i'll gather my people
but what the name

Who all's going?

Say 7:30-7:45 and your on.

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/19/2000 01:22 PM
well, figure we need to get there and get a spot, but at the same time 
well....no one of us finishes that early...so i'd say 7pm

What kind of time frame are we looking at?

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/19/2000 01:18 PM
i was thinking yes...
i talked to him and said we were going out, his up for it..
If not there then anything else, well is rather clean and expensive...and i 
like the guy and all, but if i can hand out with him and buy him cheap food, 
then its a plus

Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the 
Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.  
She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we 
are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please 
let me know if you have any comments in this regard.

One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and 
since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the 
conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be 
sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some 
intelligence from them.

    For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,
                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and
                   conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an
                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've
                   dragged your tin cup across the bars long
                   enough. I smell a prison break. . . . 

AQUARIUS

                   For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and
                   morph into much more. Every step you take
                   seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities --
                   especially lately. The old rules don't apply
                   anymore. The idea of signing up for something
                   and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit
                   an innovator like you. Your developing success
                   will beget an avalanche of more success. Have
                   your bags packed in preparation for spur of the
                   moment opportunities and travel necessities.
                   Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big
               way. You want to know more and experience life
               on a richer level. You're not the same person
               you were even a year ago. You understand more
               about yourself. Be open to travel, moving,
               advanced training, and additional contact with
               media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius
                   -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
                   mail. . . .

You know me...any excuse to celebrate.  Name a time and place...amazingly my 
calendar appears to be open tomorrow night.

Just found out from Minal that you guys are going to Osteria D'Aldo for your 
shower.  I hope you have a wonderful time but I have to warn you that the 
wine selection is extensive and the food is fantastic (although not very 
low-cal).  I know you're in the final stretch of the bet, however this just 
might be cause for a loss.  

Bon Appetit!

I would have expected no less.

Thanks, Maria, this is very helpful.  I'm planning on drafting something this 
week for everyone's review.  Don't know if any other pipelines have tried to 
do anything similar but I'll find out.

Maria Pavlou
03/06/2000 04:39 PM
FYI a little more background:  

The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under 
Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.  In 
addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as 
well as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer 
our sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just 
transferred the administration of it to Amgas.  

The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be 
treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards 
of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is 
advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in 
any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a 
result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2 
transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the 
(former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think 
we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function 
is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough 
work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and 
explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared 
operating employee under G.   Maria 

   
	
	

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.  If we 
can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to 
simply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales 
from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could 
even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable 
that we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different 
(I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use 
of its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have 
never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys 
think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?  Has it 
ever approved similar small-volume waivers?  DF   

   
	
	

I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales 
contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.  TW no longer 
has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons 
who granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on 
a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay 
AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is 
terminable on 30 days notice.

I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make 
occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas 
deal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks 
like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear 
from you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as 
easy as it looked?  

Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to 
waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining 
sales contracts are so few and insignificant. 

Your comments would be most appreciated!

Here's the answer to your question regarding 28.  The depth and complexity 
are overwhelming.

Thank you.

Nick

nice.

Can you guys book a few deals this way in the test environment.  They are 
testing to see if they are able to generate an accurate confirm this way.  
Thanks for your help!!!

As per our discussion of this a.m., ENA IT has a "program fix" in Stage which 
will handle 
the generation of confirmations for Gas Daily swaps that may be booked as two 
legs in the
future.  This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal 
Clearing.

In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two 
legged Gas Daily
deal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in 
TAGG - Deal
Capture using the new guidelines.  Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input 
process 
should be handled for these types of deals.

I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am 
requesting that the Gas 
Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.

Thanks for your help.

Bob,

Ricky is in the process of changing TAGG Deal Clearing to be able to combine 
the deal leg
containing the Nymex ( fixed )  price and the deal leg containing the Gas 
Daily( float )  price onto one
confirm.

In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work, 
the following rules
must be adhered to when the deal is captured.

1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1.
2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.

3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be "linked" by clicking the "Link" button on the deal 
capture
 window and by inserting a row as follows:

 

 The "Purpose" above will be listed as "Deal Link" when the picklist 
displays.  The "Link" can be
 done from either leg 1 or leg 2.

 4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.

 5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.

 Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected 
on the other
 leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal 
status of both 
 legs will display "Generated".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal 
Capture,
 the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to 
"Pending -
 Revised after Generated".

Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of 
whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel 
rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of 
other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments?  
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?

Quite good.  They definitely provide a chuckle.

So Burton hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish.  Supposedly you were 
slamming them back last night."  When I asked where he garnered such 
information he told me "From our friend on 28."  I promptly sent the 
following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with 
that I drink like a fish?"  Result, no response to me but he called Burton to 
lambast him for ratting him out.  And the eternal question remains, if no 
longer interested why care so much?

Please include me on the volunteer e-mail list. 
	
	

A strong interest has been expressed in regards to forming a volunteer group 
within our program to do service/community work such as Habitat for Humanity 
and etc. 

Many of us already volunteer individually.  It would be nice if we were to 
volunteer together as well on a monthly basis.  In addition to contributing 
to the welfare of the community, this will also give us an opportunity to get 
to know one another better.  

Please respond to Gallin Fortunov via e-mail in order to be included in this

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's

Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing

Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona

10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make

Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am 
still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before 
inviting people.   
 
First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:

- imbalance netting & trading
- mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators
- hourly determination of imbalances

Is this correct?

Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila 
Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?

As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and 
I'll get it set up.

Just wanted to share this thought with all of you.  
 
 - The Paradox of Our Time.doc

It is because of nights like last night with company such as yours that I 
remain optimistic in the face of statements such as the one attached.

Sorry, I forgot to include you in the last email.  Hope to see you tonight.

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.

Wilson, my most heartfelt apologies.  I failed to include you on the last 
email (huge oversite on my part).

As far a the girls go...I'm afraid I will only be bringing myself.  You know 
these Texas girls, all my friends are either married, engaged or about to be 
engaged.

what time and where

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.

Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little 
Woodrow's tonight.  I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, 
but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as 
early as possible.

Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen.

With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want 
to go somewhere we can eat?).  Given that the three of you sit within inches 
of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me.  
Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.   If you get 
stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions.

Is there actually a fun sushi place?  And do they have Ichiban beer?

Sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was 
wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.  I think the first 
order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if 
everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.  Depending on everyone's 
preferences I have several suggestions.  Let me know your thoughts (regarding 
tonight).

The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified 
with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he 
does believe in a power higher than himself.

As for myself...

I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that 
I never know what I will discover day-to-day.

As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the 
first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great 
anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.

My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever 
idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope 
for more).
 * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.

Given all of this I am very happy.

I like this..i agree with it....
I'm still uncertain on the measure of my powers (because there so huge) i 
have defenetly tasted the fruits of my passion (an desires) ask my ercent ex 
(shannon) or all the ex that still call me for sex....and my place in the 
world..wel nothing short then the next dalai Lama..
I'm pretty happy i must say
what about you

To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
of your passion and learned your place in the world.

           -- George Santayana

With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.  

First and foremost you are a father, then a husband and then a poet.

What is my place in the world?

Please refrain from any snide or negative commentary regarding my efforts to 
gain a clearer perspective on life as they are sincere.

To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
or your passion and learned your place in the world.

           -- George Santayana

Mark, 

  Thanks for still including me in the distribution,  it makes me feel 
important.  However, as I have moved out of the controls group it probably 
isn't necessary to include me any longer.

As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.  If that is 
not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level 
of intelligence I had previously afforded you.  However, as I hate having my 
illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just 
give you the number...ext. 31455.

Sorry.  Right after I sent the email I saw that there was one from today.  If 
it get books tonight, we'll be able to pool it on Monday.  Let me know.

With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.  

Hi Susan.  Hope you're feeling okay today.

There was a gas daily deal that didn't pull in yesterday.  I thought that it 
would come in with today's data (thinking it got booked late or something)  
but it didn't.  Could you look into it and let me know where it is.

Thanks,

Carrie

RE:     Southern Advice

ADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:

The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight
and advice to Northerners moving South.

1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use
it
shortly.
2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab
of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be
along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is
what they live for.
4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find
it yourself.
5.  Remember: "Y'all is singular."  "All y'all is plural." All y'all's is
plural possessive."
6. Get used to hearing, "You ain't from around here, are you?"
7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you, either.
8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's
vocabulary is the adjective "big ol," as in "big ol truck," or "big ol
boy."
9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly
in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on
a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that
vehicle.
10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this!" Stay out of
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,
that you will ever hear.
11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In
fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,
you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was
purchased.
12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone
eating.
13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until
December.
14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local
grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.
It is just something you're supposed to do.
15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase
one,it
is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in
mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,
therefore, be prominently displayed.
16.  Be advised that in the South, "He needed killin'" is a valid defense.

I think I had too much nectar last night.

Gary Stadler

Beer is nectar.  

Just wanted to let you know that the Richardson deal has been entered into 
TAGG.  The deal number is NE2760.

The Word of the Day for April 6 is:=20

                  ambrosia =01=07 \am-BRO-zhuh\ =01=07 (noun)=20

                  *2 : something extremely pleasing to taste or smell=20
                  3 : a dessert made of oranges and shredded coconut=20

                  Example sentence:
                  "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and n=

                  our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally
                  supplied." (Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre)=20

                  Did you know?
                  "Ambrosia" literally means "immortality" in Greek; it is =
a
                  derivative of the Greek word "ambrotos," meaning "immorta=

                  which combines the prefix "a-" (meaning "not") with=20
"-mbrotos"
                  (meaning "mortal"). In Greek and Roman mythology, only
                  immortals -- gods and goddesses -- could eat ambrosia. Th=

                  that just taste or smell especially delicious.

Wilson, I treasure your NY attitude.  I think part of the reason you find so 
few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an 
intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced 
either.

        I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience. 

Wilson Kriegel@ENRON
04/06/2000 09:00 AM
good to see your not to pist off at my NY attitude and my dicking around last 
night.
I was just busting balls for the hell of it..cause some of these texans are 
complitely uncultured .....makes me laugh.
And no all girls are not FAT in Houston...but there are not that many hotties 
Vs. the great cities of the world.
It was fun though and i value your good humour and attitude. 

How to define a good girl.....or rather how do we define "good"

It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified 
what constitutes a "good" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been 
remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the 
opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at 
the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may 
not be in line.  

P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We 
really should have figured that one out last night.)

Stephen Plauche@ENRON
03/30/2000 01:11 PM
Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the "no tying" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

I am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as 
MaximMan.  While I realize you are a fan of the magazine, professing so too 
loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies (some of us do have a shread 
of dignity, which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away).  My 
advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most 
"handy".

Are you experiencing some sort of split personality today?  Should I start 
referring to you as Ben or MaximMan depending on your responses?

"In an age when cloying, dumbed-down Internet "chat" threatens to reduce 
discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual Fridays, men's-room 
vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its Pine Sol perimeter, infecting what 
is left of conversational civility.  Well-articulated sublimation--which has 
produced some damned fine (and sexy) art, music, and literature over the 
millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression.   That ageless Hot 
Boy, Michelangelo's David, could only have been produced through deft 
restraint.  But try telling that to some WWF instant Adonis with a 
protein-supplement habit."

Hi Susan,

Not to make a nuisance out of myself.  But it is extremely important that we 
pick up the missing the Gas Daily Deals.  There are 8 missing deals from 
March 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count, 
volume and value off for the upper management report that people like Louise, 
Sally Beck and Skilling see everyday.  Attached are the 26 deals from 
yesterday.  I need to know which officialized Post Id that they are in.

Please get back to me as soon as possible.  I will appreciate any help you 
can give.

Carrie

The Pub code has been changed to IF-ELPO/SJ.  Sorry for the mix-up.

   
	
	

Susan,

Can you change the Pub code on deal ND1381 to IF-ELPO/SJ.  It is currently 
IF-ELPO/SANJUAN, which we don't currently use.  If the deal needs to stay 
booked as it is currently, let me know and We'll set up the language for this 
Index.

Thanks,
Joe

The two new pub codes that need to be addded to TAGG are:

1.     GDP-WYOMING
2.     GDP-KERN/OPAL

Thanks.

In the hospital, the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their
family member lays gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking
tired and somber. I'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news," he said as he
surveyed the worried faces.  "The only hope left for your loved one at this 
time
is a brain transplant.  It's an experimental procedure, semi-risky, and you
will have to pay for the brain yourselves."

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  At length,
someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?"  The doctor quickly
responded, "$200,000 for a female brain, and $500,000 for a male brain."
The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding
eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A girl, unable to control her curiosity, blurted out the question
everyone wanted to ask, "Why is the male brain so much more?"  The doctor 
smiled
at her childish innocence and then to the entire group said, "It's a
standard pricing procedure.  We have  to mark the female brains down, because
they're used."

You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce 
Cockburn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing 
this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.  
Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how 
much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check 
it out.  Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless 
Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.  Sorry so short with 
the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email 
throughout the day.

   

... hey you, are you interested in going in on a gift for Jessica and Clay
from Dished from the Past?  We want to get them something nicer that costs a
little more... Emily and Lisa and I are going in together so far...

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Woody's?

I heard on KPFT this mornig that Bruce Cockburn is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings "Last Night of the World" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness Susan, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on KPFT and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Joe Ely, Adam Duritz, Willie Nelson
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!

-Jen

Thanks.  Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be 
made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you.

   
	
	

I talked to Lindy last Friday,  let us know when or if we need to discuss 
further--  
Manual processes can still work--I think
MK

   
	
	

In discussing the finer points of EFBH Service with our market services 
people, an issue has arisen with respect to allocation of FTS-1 and FTS-3 
capacity.  We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity 
into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to 
circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &c.).  Here's why.  If 
capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1 
together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity 
created by EFBH.  This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last 
minute. Then you know what would happen:  FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH 
cancelled.  I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS 
schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.  To keep this scenario from happening, 
we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut 
unless EFBH doesn't show up.

Obviously, there is more to it than this, and Lindy and I would like to 
discuss it with you.  The systems people can't continue their work until we 
get this resolved.  Can we discuss this on Monday or some other time next 
week?  

Thanks, 
SS

Something to keep in mind:  Since FERC has implied that it considers shipper 
support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other 
pipelines, the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing, the 
better.

Hey, just wondering how your weekend of golf went.  Wouldn't want to be 
accused of cutting off contact again.  

P.S. -- I got a very interesting response from Plauche following the mass 
email...he is definitely a different chap.

You must have too much time on your hands.  The situation has been corrected.

Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

You try and do something nice, keep people informed and involved and it just 
gets thrown back in your face.

That's okay though because, "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and dog-gonnit 
people like me."

You're off.

Sorry I've been MIA this week...new job and all.  Thought you might get a 
kick out of this email.  It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40.  
And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his). 

Yes I will be attending the Taster's dinner this evening.  Look forward to 
seeing you there.

Here are my comments, spice girl.

You can take me off of the email distribution for FX exposures also.  Thanks.

Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?  You know me well 
enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly 
enjoyed the preceding banter.  Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I 
am a lady. (I have a bad habit of forgetting.)  

Sorry, I'm just giving you a hard time. Please let me know if my behavior was 
inappropriate.

Yes, it was.

Sorry, I'm just giving you a hard time. Please let me know if my behavior was

It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly 
and enthusiastically.  (Tobin, you should watch how quickly you respond.)

All those in favor of Susan making an implication, say "Aye".

It was not meant as an implication, but rather a reiteration of mind-sets 
expressed to me on multiple occasions.

   

I think you may, in fact, be onto something there Sir Freeman. :)

That was an insightful commentary on the male condition. I guess you're 
implying that all of us guys need a good lay or day. Even Lisa too.

Thanks for all your help the other week ... the article in the e-mail below

We passed... check out this article - Ramesh pointed it out to me:

http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/000323/sc.html

"Moody's raises Enron Corp long-term debt..."

"...Stress testing and VAR calculations in the Wholesale business are 
consistent on a relative scale with other commodities trading firms..."

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)

Jen, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.  I 
spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure 
the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on 
that.  I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big 
screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Emily, Katy and 
myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.  We met 
the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.  It renewed my faith in the 
opposite sex.

Disclaimer:  I do not like forwards.

Grandma sent this to me today and I thought it was good advice for "us
kids"... have a great day.

Love,

Jen

No wanting to incur the wrath of Jen for failing to keep you informed.  Monte 
Montgomery will be playing at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge May 6.  
Hopefully, we can make this one.

Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be 
back in the world of reachable individuals next week.  I'm glad you 
appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.  I was afraid after 
two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that 
last email would have 
probably been the final nail in the coffin.  

As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader 
went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too 
many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the 
connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my 
learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine 
down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.

You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't 
pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would 
enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things 
are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the 
case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate 
your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have 
had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the 
favour you once did for me.  

Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.

P.S.  How was Canada?  I heard through the grapevine you went the other 
weekend.

Do you honestly think Tobin can be a substitute for you?  

Gary Stadler

Main Entry: al?tru?ism
Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to "concerned 
individual".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, 
extremely unselfish
young man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.  
The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 100 films of 
the Century list,
and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List..

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.

 

Hugo, you can go ahead and remove me from the distribution list as I have 
moved out of the controls group.  Good luck with everything, it has been 
great working with you.

Part I:  Dress Code for Female FERC Lawyers at FERC Proceedings*

Skirts must be mid-calf length and of a synthetic fabric.
All clothing worn in FERC hearing rooms must be properly aged (12 years or 
more).
No solid-colored garments are permitted.  Exceptions:  mauve, pink, peach, 
teal, harvest gold.
Hair must be fuzzy, multi-colored and must partially conceal the face.
Suntan hose must be worn at all times.  
Open-toed shoes (preferably in a lighter color than the hem of the skirt) are 
preferred.
Those with a flair for fashion are permitted to wear inexpensive animal print 
garments, metallic accessories or clothing with fake fur trim, so as to 
attract attention to one's originality.

*also applicable to female practitioners at the Texas Railroad Commission and 
Public Utilities Commission.

Jason, you can go ahead and remove my name from the email distribution list 
as I am no longer working in the controls group.  I've enjoyed working with 
you and will definitely pay you all a visit when I travel to London this 
fall.  Cheers.

Joel, you can remove my name from the distribution list as I am no longer 
working in the controls group.  I have moved over to gas trading and am 
supporting one of the traders.  It's been great working with you and I'll be 
sure to say hi when I visit London this fall.  Cheers.

After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no 
longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they 
all used to be?  I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email 
could have.  They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or 
personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the 
ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.  

I really don't know what to say about the email.  If I didn't know what 
happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what 
I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just 
confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I 
had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send 
it to him in a heartbeat.  But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.  

I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email 
dialogue throughout the day.

In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am 
proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would 
appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday 
at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at 
Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, 
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a 
piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's 
plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one 
evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such 
an outing.

your years."  - - Abraham Lincoln

Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request.
A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what 
happened?
I would never ignore you on purpose.
I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info.

that existing ROFR should not be grandfathered.  Please send any comments you 
have to me.  Thanks!!

Thank you for all the comments.  Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing 
comments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday 
March 10.

Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:
1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & 
revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess 
revenues. (p.2)
2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to 
existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our 
rights. (p.4)
3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to 
immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate 
agreements. (p.5-6)
4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, 
clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying 
the Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we 
have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.
5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price 
caps on capacity release is to be implemented.

Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is 
being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

Love,
Susan

Thanks Dennis.  Do you have the form of discount letter too?  If so, please 
send it. 

   
	
	

Please call me if you have any questions.

Dennis
X31715

The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from 
day to day.
The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term 
and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter 
is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW 
to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the 
service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  

My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it 
should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 
months.  

If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it.  
Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it 
last December.

   
	
	

I do have a problem or concern with this--  how do we argue it is daily 
capacity and at the same time we agree to rate to be applicable for a year?  
MK

   
	
	

Yes, we did revise the language.
Commercial Group's question is whether we see a problem with making the 
discount effective for one year.  I think it should make no difference.

   
	
	

I thought we had worked on some revised language, because we had a concern 
when the agreement indicated the discount was available for the month.  Glen 
was working with you on this I believe.  MK

   
	
	

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)

Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook

1.  "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your 
pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading 
into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the 
west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.

2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, 
parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of 
the party will appear several times in one sentence.

3.  The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."  Example:  
"Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."

4.  "In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or 
"concerning."

5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, 
repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for 
emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a 
contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the 
provision once.

6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading 
before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers 
what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.

I think there was a problem when I tried to send this before...so here it comes again.

Hi DeShonda,

I had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.

Thanks,

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Are you still alive?  I'm just checking b/c I haven't heard a peep out of you in a while.  Drop me a line and let me know what's up.

If you're on the internet right now, I'm trying to call...our meeting was postponed.

When you get a chance, tell me again what your schedule is for the end of April through July.  I'm trying to figure when I can come visit and not pay too much on airfare, be able to stay a decent amount of time and not miss critical days at work.

I will definitely come over...just don't know if it'll will be when Katy does.

Sue

Just got the email myself...will definitely check it out.
  
Thanks

Theresa and Nicole,

Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  

Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:

	-36169000
	-36177000
	-33084000
	-33085000
	-33038000
	-31029000
	-33171000
	-33175000
	-116388
	-903145
	-IT-601
	-41066000
	-41075000

If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.

Thanks for all the help,
Susan

Did you just add another ticket under my name or did you request three additional tickets?  As for dinner, I just emailed Katy and asked for her preference.  I think it'd be more pleasant/less hurried if we went afterwards...say 8:30ish, but before would work for me too.  I haven't talked to my Mom yet about the tickets, but I'll give her a call when things calm down a bit here.

Talk to you later,
Sue

   

Sue,

I called and we are set for tomorrow night.  Are we going to try to dinner before, after or middle depending on how exciting it it? Were you able to find out the specifics on the airline tickets?  Transferring the tickets to my name, etc?

Just curious.  We can talk about it tonight.

Earl,

Long time...no nothing.  How goes it?  Just wanted to drop you a line and see how the fam's doing.  Hope all is well.  We really need to grab a drink after work sometime or a late afternoon coffee and catch-up on each other's respective endeavours.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey,

Just wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told Lisa about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.

See ya,
Susan

Hey,

Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  

So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.

I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

   

well. glad you're bk from paradise and filled up on fruity drnks.  just got
bk from day of grp project  hell, and now my damn portable phone isn't
chged, so cannot call- will try to tomorrow. am jazzed- going to the canary
islands off the coast of africa for 4 days at easter on super cheap last min
trip.  can't wait- could be scary.  my virgin hie skin won't know what to do
w/ all that sunshine!  will definitely be coming bk crispy!  glad it was a
'fruitful' trip....

Sunil,

I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).

I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.

Susan

that's okay...i'm used to it at this point

thanks

I believe this was intended for the Susan Scott with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas=
 Trading.

Thanks

I'm leaving shortly for the airport, but I will give you a call when I get back so we can discuss transport to SA.
I am way too excited about this trip (many pics will be taken).

Susan

I completely agree about foregoing the Mucky Duck Tuesday...too cold and too rainy for me.

   

Oh boy was that ever a thunderstorm last night.... it was GREAT!!!  Good
call on not heading out... we will re-schedule for sure :o).

I'm excited about your trip to the Caymans... lucky dog!

So... about our little venture to S.A.... when are you getting back from
your trip?  I am up for driving Friday morning.  If you want to go to Austin
Thursday night please feel free... that is fine... I just feel calmer when I
don't have to drive at rush hour.  Aaahhh!!!

I can't wait to catch up wich choo!

Talk to you soon,

Jen

the Cayman Islands

We're leaving in about a 1/2 hour for the airport and I am extremely excited about the trip.  I will be sure to take lots of pictures and drink many fruity drinks.  Actually, I'm going scuba diving tomorrow and then we're taking a catamaran on Saturday out to some island (I will be taking full advantage of the sunning net for the trip out to the island).  Additionally, we've got first class dinners booked every night and I should be able to fit in a massage...I know, it's sick.  

Also, I'm sure you noticed that I emailed Niclas about you so the door has been cracked open...Just a warning though, based on a Tuesday night conversation with Lisa I'm afraid our dear Mitch may be biting the dust soon.  We'll see though, she has become very flighty (okay, is flighty) when it comes to guys.

Sue

Hey Lisa,

Once again I am so impressed with your organizational skills when it comes to this wedding.  Just wanted to let you know that I will definitely be attending the luncheon on Friday and may even end up riding to SA with Jen (which always makes the drive that much more enjoyable).

As for the "Manicures and Pedicures for the Girls", I would like to put my order in for a Turkey Breast sandwich on white.  I can't wait till next weekend, it's going to be so much fun...can you believe it's almost here?

Love ya,
Susan

PS - I've mailed the receipt for your nightie so you should get it by Saturday...sorry it took me so long.

   

Girls-

Hopefully you got your itinerary in the mail.  Please email me first, if
you did not get it and second, what your order is from Zito's.  The menu
should be in there.

Thanks!
It's really coming up!!!

Love you!
Lisa

Yup...I leave for the Caymans today.  Our flight out is at 1:45, so we'll probably be leaving the office around 11:45 this morning.  I am, understandably, very excited.  

We will definitely talk more about Tuesday night either Sunday or Monday.  As for Civil War, I'll keep checking to see what the deal is with the tickets.  The going away party for Kenny should be really fun, I'm glad you're in the states and able to see him off properly.

Have a good weekend and I'll be sure to take lots of pictures.

See ya next week,
Susan

   

Hi Susan,

I guess you leave tomorrow for your little trip.  I am so jealous.  But if anyone deserves it, it's you!  Anyway, I am excited about next Tuesday.  Should be fun.  We can discuss the details next week.  Have a great trip!!!!!  Talk to you Sunday or Monday.

Katy

Julie,

I don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.

I am so excited about my trip out to San Diego to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  

Hope things are going well with you, the job and Brendan.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.

Talk to you soon,
Susan  

Civil War may be sold out...I'm checking on it.

KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER!  com'on.....realllly!  one
would think this email was to organize a trip to london- but nooooo...it's a
"hands off" warning instead.  and admittedly, the bit about "trusting me to
honor" pulls at me and w/ anyone else, i'd snap into good behavior mode, but
then i step bk and realize how sneaky and evil (hel-lo?  who is mitch?  does
she have dibs on him as well?  how many 'dibs' are we allocated?  let me
know when you get the scoop...)what nerve!  as for the 1 line about coming
to london, katy isn't coming mid may- she's coming at the end-begin. of
june, which is much better for me, too- have school full-time til last week
of may....so, i vote you send her mid may, then come w/ kates at the end of
the month.  and, gee- do tyou think i can predict her visit?  let's see-
it'll be convenient and cheap to stay w/ me....but- perfect timing for her
to show up at my doorstep, get her extra key, then jaunt off to 'secure' her
position w/ mr.dibs....not that i'm complaining- just horribly offended that
she thinks i'm so dense as to not be able to see- and hear- her large, slow,
unoiled wheels a-turning....!  aughhhhh!  see below, obviously....

I was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.  If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).  I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to Lisa about this and I need a co-conspirator.  

Sue

I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.  I'll try and give you a call later today.  I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.  It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something.

Susan

   

Susan,

Sounds good to me!  Let me know if you get the tickets. Call me later!  If I don't talk to you tonight, have a great time in The Caymans!!

The below is a list of Friday, March 23 deals in which the Confirm was not =
sent to C/P by Mar 26 (T/D + 1).

So transparent....I will pay you good money to hook-up with this guy.  Would get hours of enjoyment from such an event.

I'm just glad I'm going to be out of town for the next 3 weekends.  What pray tell will she do?  With no buffer there, will there be any reason for Mitch not to shack?  I'm curious to see how all of this plays out.  She keeps looking for signs to know whether Mitch is right or not...I told her it's pretty unlikely that anything's going to whack her over the head so she's just going to have to figure out for herself what she thinks of him.  She's got such a tough life.  

Oh, my Mom was over Sunday and made some comment about Lisa always dating someone....she still denies.  Cracks me up.  Response is always,  "I've only had two serious boyfriends."  To which I've started to respond, "We'll I'm batting zero and have only one legitimate first date with a guy.  In relative terms, you are a dating phenomenon."

I definitely need this vacation,
Sue

   

she must live under the "PR mentality", that being 'any attenion is GOOD
attention'.....and of course there's NO regard for the audience.  makes me
think of the jon lovitz SNL skit: "i just want to be loved, is that so
WRONG?!?"

I know, I know.  It's still weird to me.  While I thought it was great that Lisa was holding back on the physical side of this relationship early on...I'm beginning to wonder if she really likes him, or just likes having someone to talk to who will cater to her.  I mean, I'm all for prudence when it comes to the physical side of relationships, but after a month of constant contact and interaction I would have to question the fact I didn't feel compelled to completely jump the guy.  That's not to say I would, but I'd still have to question the lack of desire to do so.  I just don't get the impression that she is that attracted to him.  Seems more like "good buddy" to me.  I think she misses the Matt's, Alan's, Thatcher's, etc. that she got that from in the past.  

On the plus sides, he is a very happy person who loves to smile and is pleasant to be around.  I just get squeamish watching people cuddle so much.  I'm having flashbacks to sharing a room with Jen when Craigers was in the picture.  It's not a pleasant memory, trust me.  I do think it's weird that Lisa never wants me to leave their presence...they both questioned me when I took off to bed last night around 9:30...I just wanted out.

Sue

   

NO!  again, sue- you are giving lisa too much credit- assuming she is
capable of a motivation or thought that is BEYOND our comprehension!  the
truth is, you DO understand, just don't it to be the truth- it's a dark,
scary place to go!  basically, she wants to "show off"  what she HAS, and
yet again, PRAY you will be in full veg mode, looking as pitiful as, say, i
do rt now- on my couch, eating gummy bears- thoroughly enjoying my wasted
existance- so that she can further convince the oh-so-dimple mitch that he
"picked the RIGHT roomie!"  and i honest to god think she DOES think that
way.  or, perhaps, spending quality alone time w/ him would incenuate too
much of a relationship, and when she tries to "capture" the swiss boy's
affection (while cleverly using a visit w/ her good pal em as a
justification) she won't feel as bad- i mean, she and mitch WEREN'T that
close...at least, SHE wasn't.....no harm, no foul.  whoa.  should i be a
therapist, or what.  or be IN therapy- can channel people's "dark sides" so
easily, it MUST be a sign....must use my powers for good, must use my powers
for good....!

Hey Katy,

I was just curious if you had any interest in attending the reception below.  Sounds like it might be interesting to me.  Drop me a line and let me know if it sounds like fun and I'll go ahead and get a couple of tickets.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

2001 Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Corporate Partners Spring Reception, April 3!

Be a part of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston 2001 Corporate Partners Spring Reception on Tuesday, April 3 at Law building of the MFA.  Enjoy great food donated by ARIES Restaurant and The Redwood Grill, free drinks, cool art, and good friends.  To attend or with questions call (713) 639-7585.

Sorry I never got back to you last night...I ended up going to grab dinner.  I'm still up for this evening if you are.  The "show" starts at 8:00 and I think it's about a $10.00 cover.  Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.

See ya later,
Susan

   

So... tomorrow night?  You, me Mucky Duck???  Whatever is good... we can go
for a little while or whatever.  Do you know how much it costs? I am
flexible... live music with a drink or two and good conversation sounds
pretty darn good...

Let me know and I will talk to you soon... AND if this doesn't work out for
some reason... no worries and we will re-schedule soon!

He was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact Ted lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Thanks Shannon...I appreciate all the help you've given me over the last year and would be happy to return the favor in the future if there's anything you need.  

Good luck to you as well in your own endeavors.

Susan

I will definitely think about it...I would just feel bad though missing the event since I talked to Barrett (Deborah's fiancee) all about the big day at Lisa and Brad's wedding.  What may be an option is me taking part or all of Monday off and just heading to Austin Sunday and coming back Monday...I'll talk to my trader about the possibility.

   

I think you can skip Deborah's wedding.  Your good excuse is that I have to
work the next weekend.  Starting on Thursday (the 10th), I have to do Law
Review stuff until the issue we are working on is finished.  It could be two
weeks-- it could be right up until I have to start work...  I don't really
know.  Of course, I won't be working all day everyday, so we could do
dinner, a movie, etc. that weekend.

I don't want to encourage you not to go to Deborah's wedding, but, frankly,
I am all weddinged out.  Have you made plans to go with anyone?  Maybe
something could mysteriously come up...

Oh well-- it's up to you-- you could decide next Saturday if you want to...

-Corey

Best Product Placement:  Taking corporate sponsorship to absurdly intimate levels, Pepsi spokesdiva Britney Spears wore a
 tiny medallion with the soft-drink company's logo in her bellybutton ring during her much hyped commercial. Although, considering 
the amount of money the company has sunk into her, it may have been a homing device.

Starts at eight....would love to go, at least for a while.  I'll give you a call later to discuss.

I have to be in S.A. on the 6th for Lisa's bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to Austin Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  Hope you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.

Have to agree with your assessment.  And, I promise she will try like the d=

We called Cris and Chuck and sent them an email with  these pictures.
Love, Dad  There is one of me with the Starship in Wichita and the rest are

I've got Deborah Vest's wedding next weekend so that's a no go, but I was thinking about coming up the weekend of the 12th so maybe that will work.  I would actually love to skip out on the wedding...however, since the wedding's in Houston and I live here, I don't have a very good excuse do I?

And don't worry...we could wait two years and I'd still want to chat about Vegas.  One of those things you'll never really forget.  I'm sure I sounded funny and I was definitely tired, but in now way were either of these bad things.

Sue

   

Here is my suggestion--

Let's push everything back one week.  My finals are finished Saturday
morning (the 5th), and we could go to Barton Springs immediately afterward,
and eat dinner, and rent a movie, and shop on Sunday, etc.

I am really so behind on my school work that I can't justify taking time off
this weekend.  I would try my hardest, but I just don't think I would be
very much fun.

However, I would love to talk about Vegas.  I've been wondering about it
because I thought you sounded funny.  Maybe you were just tired.

Sure....I probably won't be able to come by until after lunch though.

Susan

Susan,

If you have time at some point today could you stop by my desk. We had
some problems running that GDOPT & SwapAvg Report file last week.

Cheers,

SPR

Here you go....

 

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

Susan
How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would George know?

Dave

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,
Frank

i'll stop by while making my rounds this afternoon.  and, you'll have to get someone else to tell the stories...i don't remember much of friday night and, as a result, susan had a "come to Jesus" meeting with herself this weekend.  may be the last of the truly good stories involving me for a while.

Of course I'd like you to swing by, I like talking with you ... I hear you have some stories from Friday you need to tell anyway.

no problem...i've been good, just busy with the new job.  all of the sudden i actually have time to do things so i spent the last weekend just trying to get my life re-organized.  not a very exciting weekend, but extremely necessary.  what's up with you?

thanks...so how have you been lately?

looks like the curve was marked around 9.0625 for jun/sept...but you'll have to talk to keith holst to get an absolute price

hello,

quick question on gas, ma'am..what's basis for june/sept gas call?

thanks,
mn

I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas trading.

Thanks

On March 14, 01, FERC issued an "Order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and gas supply in the West.."  (Docket No. EL01-47).

	Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
	 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they are selling at wholesale.
	-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our big quarterly reports.
	-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and authorizations.
	-- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers "rolled in" rates for generation interconnection (rather than direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

Ditto

Ray/Susan --One of you (or both) should be on these weekly calls, unless the items are being covered by someone else in our group (in which case, alert them to the EPSA call.)  EPSA is very active in making filings at FERC, taking the same position as Enron in many filings.  Sometimes we like to have EPSA file, then Enron may not need to file.  In some cases, EPSA cannot file (for example, when the members cannot agree), then Enron would file if it is an important issue to us.

For this call, Ray, you may want to be on the call since EPSA is going to file re: Cal. order.

Susan--Sarah Novosel will probably be on the call for the NY issue and Tom Hoatson is attending the workshop on capacity.  Therefore, typically, you wouldn't  need to be on this call, but I think you should listen in to learn.  (I will get you on the EPSA distribution.)

Tom--you may want to listen in to the capacity workshop discussion.

Donna --Discussion of Alliance.

yes, that time works fine for me...i was wondering what happened to you.  i had emailed you after you left the message in houston and never heard another peep out of you.  hope things are going well and i'll talk to you around 3ish.

Susan,

I'll give you a call tonight my time, 3ish yours.  Need to catch up.  Does this time work?

Nick

This is for the other Susan Scott....I sit on 32.

Thanks

Kathy Franz, our floor tech, has been notified to set you up with the two (2) printers closest to you on the 31st floor.  The printer names are:  TEAL AND JENNIFER

Again, let me know if there is anything else I can do to help you.

Linda

No problem...it makes me feel important.

Hey girls...I hate this, but I may be out Thursday.  Please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes I'll meet you there.  Otherwise, have a great time and to both Lisa and Jen, I need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal           ( both are very good things and I love good things ).

Sue

   

I think Aries is the one- event though it is $$$.
Since Ashlea went to Fox Diner last week and only said
good as a comment, then I say we go for it and try
Aries.  7pm on Thursday it is if everyone else agrees.
 I'll send the e-vite after I get a few approvals.

Hasta!
Sarah

Hey Julie,

I just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to New York went.  Las Vegas was way too much fun...so much so it's quite possible I did permanent damage.  I managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing.  Hope everything's good with you and I'll talk to you soon.

Susan

Any chance either or both of you could get together this week for coffee, dinner, ice cream, etc.?  Also, are you all going to Deborah's wedding?

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Adriane,

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from indu=

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used prim=

ct to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell pow=

nder section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing=
). =20
=09 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; =
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requireme=

=09-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the in=

yeah...i should be.  talk to you then.

Susan,

Will you be around at 4pm?  I thought I would give you a call when I get home.

Nick

Hey Paul,

Jay's already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid.  I'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if I don't talk to him before then.  

Thanks,
Susan

Jay & Susan,

Check your email for a deal proposal we are talking to Devon Energy about.  I will need your Index bid on 20,000/d, July through October 01.  We will also need to talk about the optionality embedded in this deal.

Paul

yes

Susan,
Can you still stop by before you leave today pls?

Thanks,
SPR

Sure....I probably won't be able to come by until after lunch though.

Susan

Susan,

If you have time at some point today could you stop by my desk. We had
some problems running that GDOPT & SwapAvg Report file last week.

Cheers,

SPR

Hey Em,

Hope the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.  I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).  Nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to Houston in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.

Ta for now,
Sue

Finally met Ashley Mace's man Saturday...ran into them at the cd store.  He's seems nice, but not at all what I would've expected and/or pictured.  It was strange to finally have a face to put with the image I'd conjured up.

Ciao

I would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great.  I just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work, so 6'ish is probably best for me.  Let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk.  Lisa, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and Brad dancing at the reception.  Anyway, drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet.

Sue

Susie and Jen,

I am up for tonight if you can go after work.  We could go walking too?  I
am out on Wed because I am leaving for Fort Worth on Thursday for TJ's
wedding (one of Brad's friends).  I am not going to Deborah's wedding
(UNFORTUNATELY!!!).

Let me know.

Any chance either or both of you could get together this week for
coffee, dinner, ice cream, etc.?  Also, are you all going to Deborah's
wedding?

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Okay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in Houston during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:

I could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).

The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.

Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.

Sue

PS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.

Would love to get together again sometime, but I'll think I'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go...I was the champ - though ultimately of what I'm not sure.  Frightening as it is I felt fine on Saturday, however from what I've heard that wasn't exactly the case with Bass.

Thanks again,
Susan

(You'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come)

You are so funny...I will always be there for the winner of a shot contest.  You were the champ!!! Let's do it again sometime.

You're welcome,
Adriane

Adriane,

Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those
things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you
feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now
barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly)
and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find
the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will
be able to stick to the new limit.

Thanks again,
Susan

Caycie,

That's great.  I look forward to the day.  By the way, are you coming in town this weekend for Deborah's wedding?

Sue

Hello to all!

I hope that you are all having a great week!  I know that some of you have
been asking so I wanted to let you know that I think the big day is finally
set ( keep your fingers crossed and hope it doesn't rain).  So everyone
mark March 23, 2002 on your calendar!!!

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon!
Caycie

you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

Congrats on "the move"...O'Neal told me the good news.

How do you determine which Omicron curve to use for the curves that don't have one?

I know ... I'm slow.

If you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.

Susan
How do I find out the omicron curves for these curves?  Would George know?

Dave

Please see below and note that the following curves do not have any omicron vol curves.  Can you help map these?

Thanks,
Frank

They should if they are dealing with transport, gas daily options,  etc. which are effected by the omicrons.  I would typically go to the leads of the respective regions, tell them which curves are unmapped and let them decide what omicron curve to use ( a lot of times they just asked the trader in charge of that point which curve to use).  

If the leads don't know what the omicron curves are the company's in trouble!

Do the traders know about the omicron curves?

you're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.

Hi Susan -
 
How are things?
 
I was recently in there on the gas trading floor  at Enron. (floor 32)
 
Is that the floor you're on?
 
I forgot to stop by to say hello.
 
Bobby

He sure is relentless.

I wonder how many women he's stringing along.

Hey guys,

Thought I'd drop you a line and catch up on life.  If I'm not mistaken you're actually in Australia right now doing all kinds of fun and active things, so you probably won't get this for a few days.  I can't tell you how glad I am that you've had a chance to take advantage of all the travel possibilities on that side of the world ( and not just a little jealous).  I think all of these experiences are going to leave you with some incredible memories of your time in South Korea.  

As for myself, this weekend will mark only the second in the last month and a half or so that I will be spending in Houston.  I figured by now I'd be traveled out but I can't get enough.  The Caymans were incredible...we ate at great restaurants (not Bed unfortunately, but I did see it), got to go scuba diving off the east end and swam with a slew of stingrays.  Actually, I was holding onto/bonding with one of the stingrays, just floating with the current, for about 5 minutes until I had to gently shove it off and swim back into safe proximity of the boat.  It was a completely surreal experience.  Plus, the trip solidified my appreciation and fondness for the new job, and more specifically the new co-workers, which is never a bad thing.

Speaking of the new job, things are going well.  I still have a ton to learn but I have a feeling that will be the case for a long time to come.  There is just an overwhelming amount of information, not to mention strategies and nuances to learn about gas trading as a whole and in particular the western region of the US.  I've been actively trading for well over a month now and am getting to know all the players in my market as well as gaining confidence with each additional trade.  So far so good though...I'm definitely glad I made the choice to stay in Houston and take on this role.

I had a pledge sister's wedding in San Antonio a few weeks ago, which was fun, and another "sister's" wedding this weekend here in Houston.  I tell you, it's out-of-control with all of my friend's weddings & engagements.  Two weekends ago I got hit with 3, yes you heard correctly 3, new engagements of close friends.  I am very rapidly becoming out-numbered on this front.  Still, the only thing that crosses my mind each time I hear of a new one, aside from being thrilled for the happy couple of course, is that I am a ways off from such an endeavor myself.  I just have the feeling I've got a lot of changing to do in the next year or two (or more) and am not sure that what I'd want now is what I'll want then.  Okay, change of subject...getting to deep.

Two weekends ago I went with a few of the traders from the desk to Las Vegas.  We went to meet some of our power traders from Portland to discuss west energy issues and to try and squeeze in a little fun.  Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, I think we managed to squeeze in more than a little fun.  I think my earliest arrival back at the hotel room that weekend was around 6:30 am.  I don't know if it's the oxygen they constantly pump into the clubs and casinos or the steady flow of free drinks, but you really do lose all track of time there.  I feel certain any duration longer that a weekend would either kill me or force me to take another vacation just to recover.  I managed to walk away only $40 bucks in the hole so all in all I was feeling pretty good.

What the future holds? - I'm planning a trip to London in early June to visit Emily and then she comes back to Houston for about a month, so I'm really looking forward to that.  And, I'm still trying to figure out when I'm going to come visit you guys...I was thinking August, given your trip to Hawaii in July and my trip to London in June, so let me know your thoughts.  September is also an option if that works better for you.  I think I'll try to take 6 or 7 work days off so that we could travel while I'm over there if we wanted to and so we'd have two weekends.  Anyway, it's obviously still in the incubation phase.

Hope the trip was a rousing success and I'll talk to you soon,
Sue

my new cell # is 713-775-6472

I'm sure she knows you're CC'd her on the email...she wants you to witness the flirtation.  She told me about the exchange last night and was wondering how he got your email address.  I told her I sent it to him.  She said, "I didn't think you knew his last name?"  To which I responded, "I didn't , but I called you and got it remember...I thought I told you I was emailing him to give him Emily's email address.  I'd promised him at Kenneally's that  I'd send it when I got the chance."

Lisa was none to pleased with me...she wants you to have nothing to do with him, but I told her she has to share the wealth and quite being such a boy hog.  I promised her we'd find her a new boy toy closer to home.  Speaking of which, she and Mitch had the "let's just be friends talk" last week ( which I think was the right move ).  

Glad you got some good sleep last night, but we need to chat when you get the chance (and not while I'm at work), so give me a call on the cell phone sometime.  Nothing bad, just a good little story.

Sue

   

does she know i'm CC on this?  think you may be busted for passing on the
email....i know you're scared.  am glad lisa is capapble of explaining the
intricacies of my mind to strangers- particularly my penchant for
streotypes.  screw enron- this girl needs to become a psychologist!  all
this time we sat w/ matt in your living room she was merely OBSERVING
queitly...and has nailed me!  we've benn WRONG sue!  am glad to find out
about my hostessing duties via a CC email- should i bust her on this?  could
be very gratifying.  am now wondering why i was being so shy and considerate
in my 1st email- THIS is the stuff that MAKES me want to taunt!  see below,
obviously.

I'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.

Despite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.

Susan

By the way, do we have a particular time in mind?

Well, I feel like I missed out on a lot last Friday, hence the get together tonight.  The plan is the Front Porch right after work for anyone thats interested.  However, come knowing (good or bad) Susan, and most likely Eric, are foregoing a repeat performance. 

So please forward to anyone I have missed and hope to see you there.

Chris and Nick, I know its probably a long shot that the two of you will come, but thought I would try. Its been too long.

Lisa

I'm sure you don't want me to remind you in detail of your own birthday experience?  Europa, the shrubs across the street?...and it wasn't 2 hours, more like an hour to an hour and a half.  Besides, I think Bass spent a little more time than myself praying to the porcelain god (at least I had the good sense to just pass out when I got home).

i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 2 hours

oh, it's on!

what are you saying i can't handle my liquor?  you want to do a shot of 151?

Alright guys, you have to know we're kidding.  I don't think either of us are going to be wagging that war again any time soon.  Bass isn't even going to be there.

Susan.....think twice about that!

why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself.  

all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at front porch also SUSAN!

Hey,

Just remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and Owen Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.  If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.  Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.  I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.  Either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you.

Susan

Sorry I didn't return your call last week.  I actually didn't check my voice mail until Friday after work and thus saw little point in calling back as you were probably in some remote area of pristine, scenic beauty by that time.  Hope the camping trip was a rousing success and allowed you to reconnect with your old friends and old self.  I am in desperate need of natural beauty and negligible pollution but have alas been trapped in Houston the past couple of weekends.  I see a road trip in the not too distant future for myself, if only to get a way for a while.  

Susan

Okay, you asked for it....

The mind I love must have wild places, a tangled orchard where dark
                                  damsons drop in the heavy grass, an overgrown little wood, the chance of a
                                  snake or two, a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of, and paths
                                  threaded with flowers planted by the mind.
                                  - - - Katherine Mansfield

I absolutely love this quote.  It manages to state, significantly more eloquently than myself, my own personal mantra of the last few years...I want to be pleasantly surprised.  Which is ultimately why I don't see it within my power in the near future to settle.  Maybe years down the road when desperation has set in I'll break down and throw myself at some sub-par individual, but let's hope it never gets to that point or if it does that I'm bordering on senile and just don't know any better.  

Anyway, I'm so glad we got to spend so much time together at Deborah's wedding and I love hanging out with you Mom and Becka (sp?)...they crack me up.  If there's anything I can do to assist you with this wedding, let me know...even if you just need someone to run errands with or support your ideas.  I'd love to get together sometime this week for a drink, coffee, dinner, or whatever if you have any free time.  Maybe Lisa would be available as well?

Talk to you soon,
Sue  

Em,

Glad you had such a good time...sounds like Norm may have even had a little bit of fun?  Anyway, must agree on the ex-fianc? front ( I am understandably nervous about said individual's return to Houston ).  Have to agree on the German beer/food front as well.  I loved everything about that country while I was there, especially the people.  They were all so jolly and round.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Had another pledge sister's wedding this weekend, Deborah Vest, and it was beautiful of course.  Happened to run into Doug George, a.k.a Big Ken, and he said to say, "hello".  He's living in Austin these days and is planning on going to grad school in a year and a half or so (though hasn't applied yet).  He said he saw T.L. recently in Dallas and Taylor has gained about 40 lbs, gone off his rocker, and is dating a girl who used to have purple hair...all sufficiently disturbing news.  Anyway, maybe we'll be able to get in touch with Doug if we end up going to Austin while you're in town.

we're back....and have drank more beer and eaten more pretzels than any
human should.  have a new appreciation for beer- it may have been the
precious beergardens and fab weather, but am convinced that german beer is
in another stratosphere than coors light et. al......am not sure it can be
duplicated at home.  beautiful countryside- grt food and weather.  the
little cities were straight out of hansel and gretel and the sound of music.
  am still jet lag and confused, but will try to call tomorrow or next day.
think it may be time to totally nip the ex-finace in the bud, or you could
be in for a loooong summer....chat soon-
e

Hi Guys-
I just wanted to let you all know that Jaron finally popped the
question!  Of course, I said yes and we are just so excited!  We will be
very busy these next few months, but wanted to let everyone know that
the date will be August 11.  I know it seems soon, but we have been
doing a little planning and are ready to start our new lives together.
So, if possible-save the date!  We would love to have you join us.  Take
care and talk to you soon!!
Laura

It was indeed an area bequeathed with natural beauty and with minimal pollution. When the pictures come out I will be sure to let you see them. I arrived back at 2am last night - I actually feel good now, which is rather odd given the general level of exertion the past few days. Yet it had been too long since I sat in front of a fire away from civilization as we know it and passed around a bottle of whiskey. Very therapeutic for the soul. Now it is time for some more Enron therapy once again, for an indefinate period of time... Perhaps you would be interested in going out with Tobin and myself on Thursday to the front porch? That is another form of therapy that I quite enjoy...

Enjoy your day,

Ben

airfareplanet.com supposedly has flights around $545 at the end of the month...may be worth checking out.

I keep trying to msngr you at lisaenron and it say you're not available.  Are you not signed in or do I have the wrong address?

Don't know what you think, but Duncan Sheik is playing at the Mucky Duck tomorrow night...Thurs could work for me too, we'll see.

I loved it!  Thanks for the "mantra"... very good young Susan, very good...
I would love to get together this week.... what does your's look like?
Thursday night possibly???

Thank you too for hanging out with us this weekend... I had a ball (which,

What do I need to do to get the VCR fixed....I NEED to rent movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No problem...I'll give you a buzz if they show up at my desk.

Susan, I'm working on the address problem.  In the meantime, though, I think that two packages have been mailed to me here, and, given the interesting way our mailroom works, they will probably come to you.  If you want to just call me, I'll come pick them (and any other misdirected mail) up.  Thanks for your patience... 

please call...will be leaving in about 15-20 mins. so disregard phone message and call around 11:40 your time.

ok- just got off the phone w/ you- kind of like a 007 conversation.  what's
with this screening business?  am afraid of this enron big brother stuff.
am bk on the web trying to plan my next internat'l trip that i can't afford.
  am absolutely travel ga-ga.  must get control.  but austria and croatia
are calling...as is italy, greece, morocco....aughhh!  so good to hear about
the old neighbors!  was just hinking abou the good old days and the kens.
esp. when sabrina shacked up in my bed while i was away.  hope the kens are
ok- really want to see little, big, and medium ken, as well as sonny.  since
you are the only responsible texas connection, am putting you in charge of
the reunion, ok?  do you have ken and doug and taylor's email or #?  let me
know so we can renew contact.  should be worth a few laughs....miss the good
old days of ridiculous irresponsibility.....do not know what to say about
this lisa situation.  am not jazzed about the fact that i can see- and hear-
the wheels turning, yet she doesn't have the nerve to LET ME KNOW she'll be
staying w/ me.....merci beaucoup.  am DEFINITELY going to have drinks w/ her
swedish delicacy.  prob not good considering the drinking binge i've been on
since germany.  am suggesting you begin upping the ante while drinking for
the next few weeks before you get here.  am warning you- it may be ugly.
did you get tickets to the eagles?  if you don't, you can just chill at the
pub or jaunt off w/ an enron person while we're gone and we can meet up
later.  am going to try to call in an hr if i don't pass out- literally have
had 12+ pints, and vision is blurring....if can't chat now, will call
tomorrow....

I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas trading.

Thanks

Susan, Could you or someone else be on the lookout for FE's tariff filings in compliance with this order.  Thanks.
Janine
FERC has approved FE's modifications to its market based tariff (MBT) to accomodate the provision of 1120 MW of MSG with the following changes:

1.  On the subject of billing, FERC noted that it could see no reason why the MSG customers should be treated differently than the MRT customers who recieve a bill on the 5th of the month for the previous month's usage and must pay by the 19th, giveing customers 14 days.  Thus, FE waasordered to change the billing timetable to be consistent with the MRT.  This gives us more time to make payment.

2.  FE is required to submit rate schedules which it had failed to do, covering, Service Schedules A &B, Application for Service, Form of Service Agreement, Form of Certificate of Concurrence, Saummary of Transmission and Ancilliary Service Charges and Code of Conduct.

Also in the order was a discussion of assignability since Shell argued that  MSG should be assignable from one marketer to another or to an aggregator.  FERC said that since Sec. 18.01 of the MRT provides that a customer can assign its rights and obligations with the written consent of FE which consent can not be unreasonably withheld, assignment is allowed.  

I am faxing a copy of this to Nicole and Gloria for our Houston files, should anyone want to read the order.

Janine

I think it's supposed to start around 8:30 and the tickets are either $10 or $15...any interest?

What time is Duncan playing tonight?  :o)

I don't know about the seating.  Do you have NCL tonight?  I can't remember if it's Monday or Tuesday.  Anyway, if we got there early enough, say 7:30 or 8:00, I bet we could find somewhere to sit.  Is that something you'd be able to do?

Duncan comes on at 8:30 and the tickets are $15.

I had some appetizers the other day at the MFA that were provided by Aries and they were very good.  Definitely wouldn't mind trying that place.

   

I want to try those as well as one that Lisa just reminded me of... Aries on
Montrose near Black Lab.... can't wait to see everyone!

We need to book your flights ASAP to get the cheaper rate.  Any dates/times you have in mind to leave?  I can get information for you.

I'm probably heading out of here in a few minutes, so call me on my cell phone.  Katy said she was up for going tonight too!!!  I think she's going to come over to my apartment around 7 or so. 

Talk to you soon,

I just checked some of the air fare sights and there are flights available for around what I paid for mine....not sure what i'm going to do regarding the roomie...really will have to tell her soon.  I'll be thinking.  Let me know if you come up with anything.

Drop me a line and let me know when you think you'll be getting in on Friday.  Also, did you have any interest in doing something Friday or Saturday night?

Sorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from Emily this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.

Sue

see

i really want to go when you go if y'all are going to travel elsewhere.  i think that would be a lot of fun.  what carrier did you find for $600?  are you still contemplating doing priceline before you purchase a ticket?

Hopefully you are still going to be home.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being o=
ffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be op=
ened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street lev=
el entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Ga=
rage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an=
 exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, w=
ill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.=
)

Either option sounds good to me.  Just send an email with the time and place when you guys figure it out and I'll be there.

   

Jen and I were consulting on the issue at hand and we
came up with a couple of ideas for where to
go...either Amazon Grill by the galleria or Fox Diner

Still working on it...have to talk about the apartment and leases tonight.  Talk about bad news bears!

my god, she's like that nagging cough in november that you just can't seem
to shake! know we must be sensitive for obvious reasons, but haven't played
all our cards-yet, je pense.  i think it's best you mention the fact that
she may want to ASK me if she can come.....tell her that you, katy AND kelly
have done so already, and bethlehem is FULL rt now.  no room in the inn.
which means, seriously, she may need to research alternative places to stay.
  really don't want to be a bitch, but honestly, it's my vacation too, and
as i said- love hosting, but not when it becomes uncomfortable.  will be
glad to treat her like a princess if she can come another time and give me a
heads-up.  i'm really sorry, but honest to god, things are getting out of
hand.  may also want to mention the weekend plans to go to the eagles
concert, which will be an all day affair (told all the gang to come at noon
and we'd drink margs and go to the pub all day before the concert)- i know
if you don't get tickets, you'll be ok, but lis can't go to the BATHROOM
alone....aughhhhh!  ok- off to dinner.  just saw the mandolin movie.  bad
news bears.  not on my recommendation list.  chat later-
e

I may cruise over to this place later with my work friend Monique...would you have any interest in going?  Regardless, I'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work.  Drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something.

Dan Electro's Guitar Bar 
The bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years. 

Bar/Club Profile	
The Scene
The bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on Houston's sultry summer nights. 

The Sound
Patrons ("real nice folks") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk. 

Electro-fying Blues
Thursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of Greg Allman and Richard Gere. If you're really lucky, you might even catch Jim, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars. 
Melanie Haupt

looks like the festivities start around 9:30 or so...which is probably when I'll get there.  I will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner.  maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix.

OOOOOOhhhhh..... sounds way cool!  Of course, I was reminded yesterday
morning that I have to go to the Children's Museum tonight for NCL and then
to dinner afterwards as a group bonding mechanism .... maybe I can meet you,
what time would you be going?

Well, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.  Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.  When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, "Actually, I needed some solo time."  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.

so- how did the come-to-jesus-meeting w/ lisa go?  lease?  london?  etc?  as
i read her little response, i could just see her eagerly clicking the send
button w/o a second thought...and bless her heart, it was just the sort of
response i'd expected.....

Going to hear some live music tonight at Dan Electro's Blues Jam in the Heights...excited to try something different.  However, I am ditching Kates, Lis, and Laura J. so mums the word.  Just don't feel like having a dinner filled with cotton candy chat.  

often think lisa was meant to live in little house on the prairie
times....heaven FORBID should a girl go ANYWHERE by herself.  what a loser
you must be.  how MORTIFIED she would be to know i saw cptn corelli ALONE
last night (a sacrilege!)  AND am going to paris next week for 1 night
ALONE....oh, and am meeting mr. swiss for drinks mon night.....he MUST be
doing this loser a favor so i don't have to drink alone....

Hey there,

Just wanted to check and see what your plan is for this weekend.  Shoot me an email if you get the chance and let me know when you're going to be driving into Houston.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

that sounds good...don't push yourself to do too much, you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring.  plus, you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with...talk about exhausting!  i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what, if anything, we want to do.  personally, just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me - nothing big.

Probably tomorrow morning.  My brother couldn't come in, but I foresee a
long day here, so I don't know if I would be able to get out until too late
to drive home.

If anything changes, I will let you know.  Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow.

-Corey

Perfect....Katy also just called to let me know that John Conalee is playing at the Tin Hall tomorrow night, so that of course is another option.

Sounds perfect....  I'm also being a wimp about driving home tonight because
I've been feeling like I am about to get sick for three days. Someone told
me the mold count was high, which would explain it.

Leslie is moving to Houston tomorrow.  She is living at the Extended Stay
America near you.  (So is Joe.)  I will tell her to give you a call-- she
will be working at the DA's office.  Lots of single guys with social
consciences who know that money isn't everything....

Vegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (Houston time) - 
(713) 775-6472.

If I'd spent any longer  than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.  I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am.

There's a song both you and Mary are currently playing with the following lyrics..."and now I know for the first time too, all of the ways I've been lying to you.  It's not that I don't think we can't open up in time, it's just that I'm afraid of what we'll find."  Could you enlighten me as to the artist's name?  I keep forgetting to write it down.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Well...I would certainly be up for a little travel.  The following locations looked interesting to me.  

Biarritz, Dinard, Carcassone, Perpignan, St. Etienne or Nimes in France.  Cork, Kerry, Shannon, or Knock in Ireland.  Brussels in Belgium.  Turin, Pisa, Trieste, Venice, Pescara in Italy.  And....Alghero.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.

Get back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.

Sue

hey-was at liz's when you called.  she gets sex in the city on cable, and i
had to do it....anyways- just wanting to finalize some of my own travel
plans, so wanted to see if you were at all interested in going anywhere from
maybe june 7-9....go to www.ryanair.com and type in those dates leaving from
prob london stansted....about 6 pounds each way (approx $15 RT flights) to
plavces like venice, provence, frankfurt, etc...am totally free to going or
staying, but if there's something you particularly wnat to see or do NOT in
london, i can get the stuff together now while it's cheap.  plus- may be
jetting off myslef in next 3 weeks, and don't want to "duplicate" a
potential destination.  like i said- am totally indifferent- i LIVE on
holiday, so whatever you're up for, let me know asap... chat soon-

Hey Paul,

I'm so glad you emailed.  My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.  It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).  

We will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.  I may be going to Austin for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.  Happy to hear about your brother and Josh's impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of Paul Thomas.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Work  (713) 853-1455

PS- Alan, you'll have to come out with us now....no more hiding.

Hey Alan, Lisa and Susan,

How are thing going down in Houston?  I hope things
are going great.

I am going to be in town next Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and I was wondering if yall had
time to hang-out?  I haven't seen any of you in a
while and I would love to hear how you are doing.

If you were curious, life is good for me.  This summer
is going to be one of the busiest(and coolest) I have
have ever had.  I am doing alot of stuff I have always
wanted to do(missions trip to Costa Rica, helping
start a small business, best man in my brother
wedding, usher in Josh Williams wedding, etc, etc)!
Next fall I will be going to get my MBA - I am
supposed to decide where I will be going by the end of
the week.....

Anyway, if any of yall have time let me know. I would
love to see you.

Paul Thomas

Hey,

Good to hear from you.

Can't say I have too much scoop on Reliant.  Although, I do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and I'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like.

I'd love to get together while you're in town.  Tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance.

Ciao,

Hello Susan,

I hope that you are doing well and looking forward to the weekend!  I am
actually going to be in town, so perhaps we can all get together one night.
What is your schedule?  It's been too long.  Black Swan....???

I have an interview tomorrow with Reliant Resources and wanted to know if
you knew anything about them...being in the trading industry yourself.  The
inside scoop would be great!

I'm flying out tonight, but can always be reached on my cell at (713)
385-3358.

Take care,
Mary Rebecca

I've got an opinion now...I think we should fly into Brescia (Italy).  We could fly in and cab it to Brenzone.  It's on one of those amazing lakes in northern Italy (Lago di Garda).  You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.  It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.  Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.

Give me a call whenever you get in...

I know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phon=
e.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continen=
tal is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to=
 H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each ot=
her!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics defini=
tely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the Enr=
on people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I fig=
ure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll j=
ust get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape=
 to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's goi=
ng to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip afte=
r you have a chance to look...Lisa and I have both been to Salzburg, but I =
don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and =
there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.

Ciao,
Sue

ok- we lose.  didn't know what to do- she was like a little terrier chewing
on my sock and would not let go.  she insisted on waking you up and MAKING
OUR PLANS!  yippee.  ok- am going to try to be upbeat.  haven't actually
traveled with lisa, maybe is not bad.  but will say this:  am NOT blowing m=
y
stock $ savings from last 7 yrs to be bullied into shitty vacation.  i gues=
s
she's staying w/ me- funny, she never asked.  assumed that it was ok to put
potentially 5 people into 300 sq. foot flat.  sorry- don't want to get
huffy, but was really looking forward to this, and you KNOW if the shoe was
on the other foot and she had another A&M friend coming to visit and then i
tried to descend, it would not be a warm welcome.  am imagining YOUR living
room, minus matt, ......in london.  ok, done.  will try to look up more
stuff on italy tomorrow, but honestly don't care- would just like to go
somewhere pretty and not big-city-like where there are not too many sight
seeing opportunities i will feel obligated to participate in.  maybe
dividing room rate by 3 will allow for a fancy-schmancy hotel
room....positive thoughts, positive thoughts...try to call/email later.

Paul,

Got your message last night and since both nights work for Lisa and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky Alan.  

So Alan, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?  If you're looking for a preference from Lisa or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.  So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.

Can't wait to catch up with you Paul.

See ya this week,
Susan

Thursday or Friday night are great.  Just let me know
if either work for yall(Forgive the brevity I just got
back from Chicago last night and I have a meeting in a
couple of hours)

Have fun,
Paul

Paul,

I got the message you left yesterday about the 5,000 of Watkins gas from Patina.  I will be sure to pass that along to Jay et al. 

Susan

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.  Lisa ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).

We'll keep working on the "trip".  I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.

Sue

Trading'em up old chap....Jay was out Friday, yesterday and is still out today so the eastern rockies are all under my command.  It's been a bit on the chaotic side the last two days so I've really just been trying to maintain sanity.  As always, it is a pleasure to hear from you and I would love to gather sometime and flex the brain muscle on something other than bid/offer and spreads.

Ciao,
Susan

What are you doing? Where have you been? Ben and I feel so alone....like a sheep without as shepherd....etc.
We have been having to spend out Saturday nights at Starbucks.... :)
What's the good word?

Ok folks...Thursday it is.  My only questions are:  Do we want to do dinner? And if so, what time?

If no dinner then we can just pick someplace relatively low key to hang out and chat...Sorry Paul, no downtown clubbing for you.

Susan

Thursday or Friday night are great.  Just let me know
if either work for yall(Forgive the brevity I just got
back from Chicago last night and I have a meeting in a

Haven't decided yet, although I'd like to do dinner...any suggestions?

sorry, i thought i told you that i was going to the astros game last night with paula.  it was interesting.  tonight i may be going over to jayshree's with priya for dinner, but i will be home before to shower and clean up after i work out.  did we decide on dinner or just drinks tomorrow night?  either is fine with me.

no plans...where were you last night?

whats up?  just saying hello.  are you doing anything tonight?

thanks...if you don't mind creating the NC deal that would be great....either that or fax the details over and we'll do it here.

It's that time again......JOY

I just wanted to let you know all of the LCG pipeline is accurate for June business.  I have the usage tickets in too.  (#806233 for WIC/LCW and #806236 for CIG/LCK).

FUGG usage ticket is in (WIC/MBW #806237)  We are still working on the producer side.

thanks...do you remember what the deal is with WR Gathering?  Are the deals with England and EJW over at the end of May?

that could work...they do have food and it's not horribly crowded on Thursdays.

how about the black lab on montrose?

Ok kids...Lisa has made the excellent suggestion of Black Lab for food and drinks tomorrow.  So how does 6:00-6:30 sound to everyone?

I think this link will take you to the appropriate map...if it doesn't work just go to Houstoncitysearch.com and look up Black Lab...it will take you to a map.

I actually do know that girl...helped recruit her a year or so ago.  She always seemed nice to me and normal, but I'll ask around and see what I turn up.  Yes, I am still coming over there.  I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.  I really want to try and get together while I'm there.  I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, Emily, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.

I was very excited to hear about Caycie too.

Susan

help.  do you know this girl...millie gautam?  she is looking for a
roommate and works for enron.  could you ask around to see if she might be
a good roommate?  she went to texas and graduated in 2000.

hope all is well.  by the way, are you still coming over?  i talked to bate
yesterday and she told me about cacyie.  how exciting!
take care, ashley
Hi Ashley,

A friend of mine forwarded this email over to me indicating that your were
in
search of a roommate.  I work for Enron and will be relocating to London
this
July.   I'm not sure if you are still looking for a roommate, but if you
are
still interested I'd like to talk to you.  Enron is located in Central
London,
as you may already know, so the mentioned apartment would be an ideal
location.
Please email me back if you are still looking and perhaps we can further
discuss.

Thanks for your time,
Millie Gautam

I don't know how this fits in with your August 17 deadline, but this is
what my
sister is aware of.

Kapil
The 380 is the total price so that would be divided.  You are about a 5
mintue walk from Westminister.
Ashley

I am looking for a female to share a 2 bedroom flat in Central London.  The
rent is

?380 per week total.  It is an extremely nice 2nd story gated flat
which gets great sun and is located just to the side of the National
Gallery.

You have your choice of Leicester Square, Charing Cross, Embankment, or
Piccadilly Tube stops.  Each is within 1/4 mile of the flat.  It is a 15
minute bus ride to the City which includes time spent waiting for the bus!

I am looking for someone to move in August or September and stay at least
through the end of June.

If you have any questions please call Ashley at 0788-418-5453 (mobile).
Please forward this to anyone you feel might be interested.

Thank you,
Ashley Marynick

So are you in ?

Hey Corey,

I'm thinking about driving to Austin this weekend to see Kathy & Travis's new house as well as the two of them and the kids.  Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.  I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs. a day...course I could be wrong.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Vegas baby!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait...our flight arrives around 6:00 and then we head back Sunday morning.  It's a "work" trip.

Will do on pitching the 12th to the gang.

Sue

   

Please respond to <mharp@austin.apc.slb.com>
Man, what a deliciously relaxing vacation!  Little green monster be gone...
What are you off to this week?  Truly Miss Jet-set.

The weekend of the 12th sounds great!  Talk to the bunch tonight and see if
you can scare up a crowd.  :)  It'd be so much fun to see you again!
-MR

Hey there,

Bummer about next weekend, although I'm not even positive I'm going so the
frustration may be for naught.  As far as the wedding thing goes, thanks
for the offer but I wouldn't worry about it.  I think I have a wedding in
Houston that weekend anyway.  I'll talk to Jen about coming up the weekend
of the 12th so maybe Jessica, Jen, you, me & my friend Corey could all get
together.  I've been needing a good Austin fix.  The trip to San Diego was
awesome.  We ended up blowing off most of the plans we made so we could
just hang out at the beach, drink wine, and eat cheese and crackers (oh
yeah, and watch the sun set).  I did find time to go to a spa and get a
bodyscrub/massage which was amazing.  I'm off again this weekend so I have
to go through the whole packing routine again tonight..augh!

Hope things are well with you and I'll say high to Lisa and Jen for you
tonight.

Sue

Please respond to <mharp@austin.apc.slb.com>

I can't respond to my Hotmail account on this machine.  So...

Bummer...I will be out of town the weekend of the 28th (Jazz Fest) and will
be out Friday on the weekend of the 5th.  I will be flying back that
Saturday and will be going to a wedding with most of those guys.  Do you
want me to find out if a certain one needs a date?  Hmmmm...  It's his
boss,
so I don't know how that would fly, but I'll find out.

However, I think that I would really like to be in Austin one of the next
two weekends (5/12 & 5/19) and my plans should not in any way limit yours.
Caycie and Jessica (thru 5/14) will be here and Jen pops over all the time.
And, I know that your sis would love to see you!!  Of course, I would hate
to miss you, but since you are in the jet-set I know that your schedule is
really busy.  How was San Diego?  Or, is that this weekend?

-MR

Think I may head up to Austin Sat-Sun but I'll be probably be here Sunday night and will definitely be here Monday....Did you know Luke Olsen is playing at Blanco's tonight?  

What are you doing this weekend?

Sue

My bad...it's not Luke.  I just called and I think they said the Hollisters.  Anyway, the Radney Foster gig is extremely tempting but I really need to see my sister and the kids...depending on what Corey has to say though, I may just go to Austin Sunday and Monday.  We'll see.  Give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together.

Sue

Did not know that.... Matt is coming in tomorrow and the key word of this
weekend is RELAXATION.... we are going to see Radney Foster on Sat. at Mucky
Duck.... hmmm.... tempting eh?  I may be up for Luke tonight.... my parents
left for Colorado yesterday and I am trying to complete a mjor list of tasks
that I have accumulated.... go Jen!  What time?

Please verify price on deal 803604.  Customer sent the confirmation back showing the price to be Inside Ferc Monthly Index.

Matty already left work, but I'll be sure to pass the message along.

you all need to buy me tequila shots for my birthday so I can pass out on the couch at uropa, and then throw up in the bushes across the street

Nah, that sounds like a boring night.  I can only get completely drunk and dance like a jackass so many times in one lifetime.  

do you guys want to hit el patio early on saturday and get some blue ritas and then head over to uropa?  that would be a good night to go tear it up completely.  

I'll work on the jaunt and will do on the limeade's....talk to you tomorrow.

hey- am getting ready for the austria trip- very jazzed!  not about the 4 am
wake-up call, though.....kates and kelley got here yesterday, then left
again this morn. for stockholm.  they'll be back thurs night, me, the next
night.  am excited about you (and lisa, i guess...) getting here next week.
should be fun.  haven't given up on the chance for a jaunt off, but will
have to be last min, and have to keep cking at ryanair and
www.webweekends.com for updates as they come....if you get a chance at work,
try to do some browsing....also, some annoying requests- katy forgot all the
minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party,
and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized
neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could
each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
(carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!)
doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the
festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send
along....he said he'd get it to sally, then to you somehow.  only if it's
convenient....but the limeaide would be a lifesaver!  tell lisa it's her
"rent"  for a last-min invite w/o ever asking.....any thoughts about shows
or activities you want to see?  know all the tourist stuff has been done, so
any partic. shows?  restaurants?  let me know...as i said, have been cking
on ryanair updates, but still no grt deals- must wait til newest deals come
out, so since i won't have computer in austia, must put you in charge of
cking....clearly, lisa will be of no help in this dept, so we must take this
into our own hands.....we'll see.....ok- am off.  will try to call when i
get bk to london fri- hope memorial day was fab....

Wow...I must say this was the last thing I expected you to be emailing me about.  I'll try and give you a call after work ( around 4:30 or so ) if you want to talk about it some more, just let me know.  I do think it's good that you guys are at least talking about all this stuff regardless of what you decide is the right for both of you.  

Sorry to hear about Jay...that is horrible.  What brings on shingles anyway?  I thought it has something to do with stress, but I could be totally off.

Glad you like the CD...I've been listening to it non-stop.  I'm totally empowered after "I'm Alright" and then plunge into super-reflective mode with "Wildest Dreams".  Get on the Kim Richey web site and read the lyrics and you'll understand why.  By the way, she's playing at Stubb's on June 14th and in Houston at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge on the 16th....food for thought.

As for my call, there was some news...he contacted me around 10 am or so and we chatted throughout the day.  I'll tell you more about it when I call, but you're only going to be a bigger fan.  That of course is the problem I'm having.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Hey Susan-
I got your message last night but it was late-- Doug and I went to see Pearl Harbor.  I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I did.
I took him to work this morning, and he was asking me about the law firm parties this summer-- was he going to be coming in for them, etc.  Although I hadn't planned to, I suggested that we take the summer off from dating.  We had a long conversation about it, and he was much better about it than he has been in the past.  It made me wonder...  He said he had thought about that kind of thing, too, but didn't want to do it.  But, if I needed it, he said he would be okay with it.  He did say he might join the Marines rather than go to law school.  I have always thought that is what he wanted to do, so maybe I am being less selfish by breaking up with him.  I don't know.  I feel pretty bad about it.  I just think this is probably a mistake, but I explained to him that I have had a boyfriend my entire adult life and I am wondering what it would be like without one.  He is in just about the same boat reagrding having had a ! girlfriend for the vast majority of his adult years.
Anyway, we might have lunch together, and we will definitely talk about it after he gets home from work.
On another note, Jay has shingles.  Isn't that sad.  I looked it up in my medical book-- they are very painful and leave scars-- and she has them on her face.  How awful!
I bought that Kim Richey CD yesterday.  I love it!
Were you calling with any news?

The price should be Inside Ferc Monthly Index....the deal has been changed in the system.

Can you guys verify this for Elizabeth?

Theresa
(303) 575-6485
Please verify price on deal 803604.  Customer sent the confirmation back showing the price to be Inside Ferc Monthly Index.

On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request for FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 requirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

Hi George

You will want to liquidate the June Exotic Options today (using the valuation spreadsheet- Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls) as well as update the Option P&L file to account for the June Exotic option's value you calculate.  You will actually roll-over the Options P&L tomorrow, after you finalize the 31st's P&L (the final P&L file will include any Prior Month Adjustments as well as broker fees).  

You will update the Basis Pipe Options 2001.xls when the actual published indexes come out...so that will most likely be Monday.  At that point you can send the file to Beatrice Reyna in it's final version.

If you have any other questions just come by and get me and we'll go over them.

Susan

Hi, Susan:

How is everything?  What do you suggest I do to become a trader? ...?  ...?   
The last question is when should I liquidate Jun Exotic Option and update Option P&L file.

Thank you very much! Talk to you later.

what is it exactly you need help with...maybe i can answer your questions via email.

Susan,

Do you think you could stop by George's desk this afternoon when you
have a free moment. We need a little help as it is end of month!

Thanks,

Sean

I've never run that file since it was split out, but my guess is you need to add any prior month adjustments and broker fees to today's file.  Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Errol should be able to help you with that.  Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily post-id's...you can find them on that color coded sheet George has.

Swing by if you need anything else.

Susan

what changes need to be made to the P&L GDOPTIONS file?  Can you remember?

Just called...they're going to put it on our door tonight.  We just have to sign it and stick it in the night drop.

Hey,

You guys have fun...sadly i'll be out due to a broker dinner.  I'll be sure to catch the next one.

All,

Fri happy hour is beckoning us to the Porch on Gray.  I plan on being there from 6pm.......

"....also, some annoying requests- katy forgot all the
minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party,
and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized
neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could
each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
(carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!)
doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the
festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send
along...."

Fear not, I have the turkey jerky.

Address...118 Portland Road (the postcode is W11 and the tube stop is Holland Park)

Phone #...011 44 2072 43 1926 (this is with the country code so I'm not sure exactly what you dial in London, I 							know you have to knock off the 011 and possibly the 44)

If you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left.  Walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto Portland Road.  There will be a pizza place right on the corner.  You'll walk all the way down Portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac.  The roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches (a place called Janie's Wine Bar will be on your immediate left).  Emily's flat is in the row of flats to your right and the number is on the door (which if I remember correctly is blue).

See you there,
Sue

Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, "Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like." And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. "You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it
again?"
"Oh, yes!" the female statue said. "But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!"

My mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.  Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.

Sue

hey- sorry i didn't get bk to you last night- got home fairly late, then was
hit by mom with "tootsie died over memorial day, and we didn't want to tell
you til we could do it in person" , so am in a pretty bad funk.  my little
baby.  i know it's just a dog, but just doesn't seem to matter.  having
harls around helps, but it's not the same.  am going to go see papa today,
then have my slough of appointments tomorrow, then off thurs night to NB, so
prob won't be out and about til i get back early next week- maybe spirits
will have brightened by then, we'll see.  will give you a call later-

Okay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and Jessica and Clay.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.

Sorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in Houston came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Any luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to Millie?

are you here?  give me a call on 0788-418-5453 if you can.

take care, ashley

Cindy,

Sorry no response from me, I've been out of the country.  Being a novice, I forgot to look at the clock exactly when I crossed.  I know it was 30 mins and some odd seconds, so my best guess is 30.10 minutes  Hope this helps.

See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the Kim Richey concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with Corey, Doug, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?

So did you make it in today?  Hope you're feeling better.  Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat. night.  Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.  Also, Boone called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.  The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).

Sue

Hey Corey,

Was wondering if you and Doug still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...

Sue  

None as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.  As for myself, I'm still  waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.  I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.  Anything in the hopper for this evening?

i am here by some miraculous fate. i would much rather go to the concert or eric bass' or yvette was thinking about having a house warming party.  so i am clueless i what i am going to do...  what are your plans for this evening?

See...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.

Lisa....FYI:  you already sent this email to everyone (at 10:48).

i am going to try to make it.  i have actually been held up in sue and
i's apt. for the past 2 days due to food poisoning or a stomach virus
regardless of which neither is much fun. hope to see you girls though
tomorrow depending

>  -----Original Message-----

I think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.

I'm still thinking about it.  I have had a bad week-- very stressful-- and last night I was mad at the dogs for barking so I banged on the window and put my hand right through it.  Surprisingly I was not cut very badly.  I think I need to relax a little.
I want to go, but I am just giving myself an out because I sort of feel like curling up in my bed with a tub of ice cream and a movie.  Actually, I felt that way more last night, but I gained perspective after putting hy hand through the window-- and after realizing that today is my last day here and everything will be finished for better or worse before I leave.
Count me in for now.  I will call you tonight.  Tell me your cell phone number again-- (775-6427?).  Doug just got one-- his number is 512-796-2320.
See you soon.

back to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.  I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!)  .

no contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.  on a another "playing with fire" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.  he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).  we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.

i'll see you when you get home.

you are apparently quite elusive.....funk is slightly lifting,but am
thinking weekend in NB will be good medicine.  kind of sad to miss the
party, but am not sure am ready to be a party girl quite yet.  will call
soon- au revoir!  back to reality yet?

Hi Mrs. Barker,

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday (Lisa and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting Emily in London).  I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.  If I am successful in pawning these things off I will be present and accounted for to help Kelly and the gang celebrate.  I will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

Hey Sarah,=20

Nice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to Lisa the other day so I g=
ot a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our=
 trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending=
 a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, soun=
ds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over =
the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it ar=
rives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and Mike =
are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was plann=
ing the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have =
you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend =
from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any ad=
vice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit=
.  Hope things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together w=
hen you come back to Texas...

Sue

Hi girls!!
Just thought I would send out an email to see how things are going in the
exciting state of Texas!!  I miss it there and I miss y'all as well...I
already sent Emily an email earlier so that is why she is not included in
this...Sorry about the group email but I thought it might be a little easie=
r
considering I would probably be writing the same thing to everyone....Life
is good here in Boulder....Robert and I are trying to make the most out of
our last months here....We absolutely love Boulder...He graduates in
December and I am leaving in August!  I love the summers here, it seems as
though the town empties out when all the college kids leave!  My plans for
the future are slowly coming together...I will be going to Dallas for the
month of August to be with Karin for the birth of the baby!! August is a
huge month for my family....Mike graduates from college (who would have
thought!), Karin has her baby, Mike and I head off to Europe, and my parent=
s
are moving into their new home...Elaina and I's parents are moving into the
same neighborhood only blocks away from eachother...Mike and I are travelin=
g
Europe for a few months together in which I am hoping to meet up with
Emily...We fly into London which gives her no reason not to meet up!!  Afte=
r
that, who knows....maybe Seattle or back to Colorado...we have no idea....I
hope everyone was safe from the flooding recently....I know that Adam's
(Wolters) home was flooded again so I think they are just gonna sell the
house....Elaina- how is married life and school?  Laura- I am so excited
about you wedding plans.  How is that coming?   I hope this email finds
everyone healthy and happy...You all cross my thoughts often...I miss
y'all....Keep in touch!
Love,
Sarah

Attached please find comments on the Illinois Energy Workshop.  I have reviewed Pam Stroebel's comments which were basically in support of the development of more generation .  She commented that Illinois' reserve margins are adequate over the next few years.  Interestingly, she claims that Com Ed has one of the largest curtailable programs in the country.  She has industrial customers representing 1200 Mw of Capacity under contract.

i'll meet for a drink right after work! does that sound good to anybody?

Okay...so here's the link.  Once you get to the sight, click on About APB and then Just for Fun.  Once you're on the Just for Fun page click on Derby 2001 and go to the last picture on the first row.  You can read the names from there.  

Hope the first day at the new office is going well.  Give me a call sometime and let me know what the scoop is regarding Wednesday and the baseball game.  I'm anxious to hear if you talked to Leslie again after the cryptic phone call on Saturday.

Sue

btw....not only no contact, but not said individual's not even logging into messenger...I think this where people tend to say "stick a fork in it."

Hey friend,

I just got your card yesterday in the mail and am so thrilled that you've asked me to be a part of your wedding.  I will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person, but I wanted to let you know ASAP that I will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities.  This really is such an exciting time in your life and I look forward to all of the festivities.

Love,
Sue

PS - Trish Murphy is playing tomorrow night at the Mucky Duck if you have any interest.

Just got your email...I'll take a look at it after morning trading.  It does sound like it would be fun.

What happened to you last night?  I was starting to get worried about you.  Also, we have one of our Taster's dinners Thursday night and both Katy and I are planning on going.  Any interest?

Would you be interested in volunteering for the Boys & Girls Club camp on the weekend of July 13-15?  I think it sounds like fun.

So if I can get tickets (actual seats...not standing room only) are you game for tonight?  The concert starts about 8:30 so I figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat.  Let me know.

Sue

Sorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.  Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha Brooks concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.  I was really wanting to see Kim Richey...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.

so you can only buy tickets at the Mucky Duck...I may go by right after work to try and get them...Do you want me to just call you on your cell phone and let you know if we've got actual seats?

Sounds good... my one conflict is that I have Book Club and it is over at
8:30... I can scoot out and we can eat or whatever... lemme know... I really
want to hear live music with you sometime in the near future! :o)

Oh boo-hoo...cry me a river.

Sorry I missed Tuesday, but I went to listen to live music with a friend from UT.  How are things going with you?  I had a great time in London and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.  Give me a call sometime, would like to hear what's new in your life.

Susan

Hey Sscott5, are you going to the Porch tonight? It is in fact steak night......How was the UK? Thanks for calling and telling me all about it....

What's up with tonight?  The Tasters dinner is at 7:00 at some restaurant called Fire and Ice.  Shot me an email or call when you get a chance and let me know the plan.

.." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity=
 - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely lovin=
g it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades g=
o into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my=
 own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job=
 allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Roc=
kets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o=
ff to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Port=
land.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so =
there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.

No need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everythin=

Why would you have to title an email "nothing bad...".  Personally, I was d=
isappointed I wasn't promoted to MD because I have brought in so much reven=
ue for Enron and as we know the entire world revolves around me.  Thanks on=
 the email and how is trading going?  Also, I appreciate your candor last n=
ight (you didn't think I would let you off the hook completely did you) and=
 thanks for calling me a god.  It was flattering.=20

Congrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager.=
..I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director. =
 All things in due time, right?

Tell me more about Cara!!!!!

Great to hear from you! I was beginning to think that I ought to send the National Guard to find your whereabouts and retrieve you.  You really didn't miss much on Tuesday since Cara came with me and we left early.
Would love to see the watch. It sounds divine. Drop me a note and lets do a drink sometime....

Tubby

Oh boo-hoo...cry me a river.

Sorry I missed Tuesday, but I went to listen to live music with a friend from UT.  How are things going with you?  I had a great time in London and came back with some Cubans for Dad and a 1920's platinum and diamond watch for myself...can't wait for you to see it.  Give me a call sometime, would like to hear what's new in your life.

Susan

Hey Sscott5, are you going to the Porch tonight? It is in fact steak night......How was the UK? Thanks for calling and telling me all about it....

yes...but i haven't heard the updates post date.

Didn't I already tell you about her? How we met, etc?

Hey,

I may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the Forest Club.  What do you think of that?  Also, Katy and I may go to Blanco's later if you and Leslie have any interest.

So I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.  I'm sick of these crappy ones.

Sue

I was just about to send you an email.  I can't get ahold of leslie-- forgot her cell phone number.  I left her a message at home and she normally gets in relatively early.  
My dad made a reservation for all of us for 8:00 at the Forest Club, but I totally understand if you want to go to the Tasters thing.  I have a feeling Leslie will come with us, so I think I am going to to go with my parents.
Let me know what you think.

Hey Matt,

Just thought I'd let you know that I'm thinking about heading to New Braunfels tonight to see Emily.  We were wondering if you might want to get together tonight...we've missed you terribly.  You can shoot me and email back or just call Emily at the river house (830 -964-2494) or me on my cell phone after 4:00 (713-775-6472).

Sue

i'm taking off right now.  just talked to em and her parents are coming up tonight to stay for the weekend and work on the house.  call me on my cell phone, i'll have it turned on at 3:30.

yes...but i've decided my hormones are about the equivalent of a 16 yr. old boy's.  we left about 20 mins after you guys and i drove him to his car.  he asked if i minded him calling to ask me out wednesday or thursday of this week as he is going out of town this weekend  (he said he'd tried earlier this year...to which i responded "yes, and failed miserably")  ...we'll see.  he is a cutie though.  i don't know if you'll ever have a chance to look at the picture of you know who, but physically bryan puts him to shame.

Sue
That would have taken my mind off some other person whose name I won't mention.

Thanks Theresa.

Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.

Susan

Couple other things Theresa...Do we have Sinclair numbers for July? And, are the Thermo numbers in Sitara good?

Thanks

Susan
Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

I can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either!!!!

Thanks,
Susan

if you get this give me a call on my cell phone....it's 5:15 right now

I'm so sorry I've hurt you Boone...never my intention.  I had no idea you were so fragile, you hide it well.  Life at Enron is good but things have been pretty busy the last couple weeks.  I went to New Braunfels last Friday to visit one of Lisa and my friends (actually it's the girl we visited in London) and then had a wedding to go to Saturday night.  

No big plans for the 4th as of yet.  I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going to be...could be Houston, Austin or Georgetown.  I know, I know...I'm such a jet-setter.  How about yourself?  Planning another famous Boone BBQ.  Cooking commences at 3:00 am, right?  

Hope you're having a nice day.

hey susie . . . you know you're hurting my feelings . . . you never email
me or go out with us anymore . . . I'm a very fragile person . . . just
playin . . . how's life at Enron . . . do you have big plans for the 4th .
. . what have you been up to lately . . .

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

still the wrong one...try sscott3@enron.com, that usually works for me.

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

Please don't send me any more compression services emails.  I have nothing to do with any of the information below and should probably not even have access to it...the Susan Scott you're looking for does not have the middle initial M.  There is no middle initial shown for her in the system.

You still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?  I just checked my messages at home and Bryan called last night...at 9:45!  I was already passed out.  I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.  I talked to Katy last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.  Let me know what you think.

Sue

That would have taken my mind off some other person whose name I won't mention.

I guess there's some sort of fine for dating...sounds like a load of BS to me.  What's your AOL messenger name?

   

why does that mean? does it not cost him money to date outside of the company?

definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.

   

ted actions or others?

he's going to Vegas I think...And I have no idea when we'd go over there.  I'll talk to Katy and see what she thinks.

I forgot that I have a work event tomorrow night for dinner.  What time do you think you'll be going?  I have no idea how long dinner will last but I might be able to come afterwards.  I guess we can play it be ear.

so i talked to bryan last night...after a few ritas and beers.  supposedly we're going to do something tonight.  very curious how this will all pan out.  i do kind of feel "old" around him.  not because he's immature or anything of that nature, but because i've been out and working for 2 yrs now and he's living at home with his parents and planning on going back to school...just feel like i'm in a very different place.  of course, as usual, i'm giving this way too much thought.

Susan

really wanted to go to the firehouse...maybe i can tell him i have to be home early and i could meet you (and Katy) there later?  i'm so bad.

Anita,

Please send this note to all identified participants in the Transmission Round Table-

To all Transmission Round Table participants:

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next "Round Table" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

"Current Transmission Project"

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our "Transmission Round Table" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

6) Go to work now!

I think this was intended for the other Susan Scott.

Thanks

Tried calling you earlier.  Did you get the link?
Sorry for the delay. I am working on getting the link for you.

Can this be reinstalled in case it got taken off when she transferred over?  ADVISE ASAP
Linda -- I used to have a link to the Enron Corp. Secretariat database -- has all the vital stats on all Enron entities.
Can you find out how to access it, as I seem to have lost the intranet site info I used to have.  It would really come in handy on this bid FERC filing I'm trying to get done.  Merci!

Well...when i was there you liquated the P&L post-id everyday, so unless that's changed you will continue to do that everyday.  For the last day of the month you will also want to liquidate the Official post-id as well.  Look at the file I've attached and it will explain how to handle the Gas Daily book this month since the last day of the month is not a week day.  The notes are in blue.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

 

Susan

Hi, Susan:

You look quite different now after leaving Risk for four months because a trader's life is less stressful than that of a book administrator (kidding!). 

A question.  I forgot which liquidation number should we use for Gas Daily P&L: P&L post ID or Official Position Post ID.  Could you recall for me?

Wish you all the best!

I just talked to Leslie, and we decided to go to dinner together.  Then, as we were getting off the phone, she said, "Is it OK if Joe comes with us."  I felt like I was going to cry-- literally-- my voice cracked when I said, "Sure...."  She said she couldn't believe how great things were between them right now.  I might die!

I may be heading out after morning trading to go home b/c I feel like dirt.

Sue

I think this is for you.

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to =
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC lic=
enses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF =
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In=
 most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless thei=
r primary business is as a utility, like Enron). =20

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform c=
ertain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site gen=
eration customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let y=
ou know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
thorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
 governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
 commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
reference thereto."

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
 exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
 rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
 a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
 status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Ina,

Is there something I need to do in regards to this email.  I appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone.

Thanks, 
Susan

I'll bet it does belong to the other Susan.  I've never signed you up for Cingular Wireless.  I do have other PrimeCo bills from before you came to the department that I do need to complete that expense report.  We just got instructions today on how to get into the new "upgraded" system (XMS).  I will process these as soon as possible and pass them on to Legal for approval.  If I have any trouble, I'll let you know.

If I have to learn another password around here, I'm gonna croak.................(just kidding). 

Linda, I checked this out and it is an invoice for Cingular Wireless for 80 some-odd dollars.  I do not have Cingular service; my mobile phone is from PrimeCo.
Have you had any trouble getting my PrimeCO bills processed?
Did you order any service for me from Cingular?
Just asking because I think this e-mail might have needed to go to the other Susan Scott.

Please do not reply to this e-mail.

Stopped by Em's last night before coming home and she'd mentioned trying to do Austin this weekend.  She'd already talked to Katy and it sounded like Katy was interested in Austin tomorrow night and then maybe Gruene on Saturday night.  Anyway, wanted to let you know and see if you had any interest.  Emily and Katy would probably try to leave early tomorrow to stop in Round Top and do some antique shopping...so, if you think you could leave the office around 5:00 or so (of course earlier is always better) we could ride together and at least get on the HOV lane.  As it stands right now I think we're going to have stay in hotels both nights and we of course currently have no reservations, so it could get interesting.  

Sue

Hope you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to Austin this weekend.  Emily, Katy, myself and possibly Lisa are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if Doug wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of Katy's friends manages Pat Green and he's playing at Gruene Hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.

Sue

I forgot Leigh Ann was going to be in town this weekend.  As for this evening, I think we're still on.  The movie is showing at the Angelika at 7:40 or Greenway 3 at 10:00...I'm assuming both of us would prefer the earlier movie, but there is something to be said for proximity.  What are your thoughts?  We could either take our time with dinner and then do the movie or just go to the early show and maybe grab dessert afterwards.  My guess is Emily would probably prefer the earlier time, since she may be taking off early tomorrow.

yeah, i talked to katy last night and really, really want to go. i think that sounds awesome. however, my friend leigh ann is coming into town on friday. i was thinking of asking her to do that instead, but shes not only coming to see me but others as well. so i am probably out unless she cancels her trip here. thanks for trying to accomodate me with a ride though. 

are we still on for tonight?

I'm intrigued...what prompted the cooking class?  If you do end up in Austin tomorrow night, we'll have to try to get together.

Sue

I have firm plans-- a cooking class at Sur la Table-- on Saturday night, but I was thinking about going to Austin tomorrow.  I would have to come back on Saturday, though.  Darn... I have never seen Pat Green, and I really want to!!  Another time- definitely.

It's been quite a while since we caught up on things.  How are you doing these days?  Things here are pretty good.  I went about a month ago and visited Emily in London and have been busy with work, etc.  Hope you had a good Fourth of July!!!

Susan

It happens to me pretty regularly.

Time:  Yesterday around 4:30 pm

Conversation:

Him:	yo
Me:	hey
Him:	guess what
Me:	what
Him:	i'm an engaged man
Him:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh

There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.

So are you heading up to Austin today? 

Sue

sorry didn't check email till today.  things have just been really busy the last month and i've been doing quite a bit of traveling.  i'm out of town this weekend, but maybe next week.

No problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's Darren going to be up to as a result of this?  

Anyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, Austin?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.

Shorty  

Thanks for note shorty.  I hope all is well in gas trading land.  I will be joining the weather derivatives desk asap as the ag effort has been shelved.  But, this afforded me the opportunity to take a vacation last week which was cool (again the charmed life of Ted Noble).  I would like to hear about your time as a trader and I have a good book for you to read about interviews with the world's top commodity traders.

FYI

Laura and Ed--
Attached are EES comments on the Illinois Commerce Commission inquiry into the possibility of establishing some additional requirements on retail suppliers that serve both residential and industrial customers (EPMI and EES are both ARES).  I think the comments are fine and promote a market based approach that focuses on real customer protection issues.  Gloria will keep you both informed of further developments by the ICC.

Jim, 
The Illinois Commerce Commission has initiated an inquiry into the activities of agents in the Illinois electric market with a view to organizing follow up workshops or rulemakings to regulate some aspects of agency activities. Their definition of agent includes power marketers, aggregators and resellers. I have filed Enron comments in this proceeding, which as the below e-mail suggests may set the tone of the proceedings. I am forwarding this to you to ascertain if there is ENA interest in monitoring this proceedings, and who will be the appropriate ENA party to update. I attach herewith, a copy of the comments. 
 

Thanks,
Gloria

I know...I'm a peach.  Ha.  Anyway, dinner was really good.  We had spaghetti (which John cooked), garlic bread and some of the red wine I'd brought over.  And, we watched Crouching Tiger which I loved.  You were right, it is a very woman take charge film.  

I forgot it was Ted's birthday on the 4th.  That was nice of you to send a card.  He isn't so bad after all...
I worked until midnight last night-- it actually wasn't so bad.  I also am feeling less stressed because my dinner for tonight was cancelled because the partner who was taking me (Mike Perrin-- do you know Hunter?  He was a Fiji our year...) got sick.  I was disappointed but relieved.
How was dinner with Monique and John?

Em got the grandparent dinner changed to Wednesday night, so we'll be able to get together tonight.  She's supposed to give me a buzz later and let me know what she would like to do.  Odds are we're looking at a happy hour, followed by a nice dinner and then who knows what. 

Talk to you later,
Sue

FYI:  Bryan called last night to see if I wanted to go out again.  I think we'll probably end up going out on Thursday...I don't know.  We'll see how it goes, but I don't feel as excited or enthusiastic as I probably should.

Last night was good...a nice, relaxed dinner suited me just right.  As for a rematch, we'll see...I've got dinner with Monique and Jennifer (you met her downtown once I think) tonight.  So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something.  I'll give you a call later.

Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com

Sue

Hi Susan!  Thanks for the info.  Sounds great to me.  We'll coordinate later.  If you get a chance, send me Julie's e-mail.  Is that her name?  I guess I deleted it from my e-mails.  Give me a call this week if you're planning on a re-match with Bronwyn ("Birdee").  A beer and a chat would be great.  Hope you have a great day at work and I'll talk to you later.

Jesssseka!!!!

I know, it's been ages since we've chatted.  I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.  

I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.  I'm actually going out of town next weekend.  Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.  Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.

I talk to you soon,

Sue

Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.

susie q, how are  you??????
 
i hope that all is  well.  i have been meaning to call you for ages.  how's houston?   how's work--still great, i hope?  how are boys?  ect, etc,  etc???
 
clay and i are doing  well.  we are half way through our summer of working and being wined and  dined.  we eat a lot!!!  we are living in my parents' garage  apt--needless to say, the summer has been a little crazy!!
 
i know clay sent you  an email at the beginning of the summer, but i just wanted to remind you that we  are going to the lake (LBJ) next weekend.  i am sure you are super busy,  but i'd love to see you if you get a chance!!  lisa and brad and jen and  matt are coming and eddie is going to come for a little bit on saturday, i  think!!
 
i will try to call  asap---
 
much love,  jessica

Did you get that Katy?  Just kidding....I'll see you guys at the apartment.

Okay Girls,

There is a showing of Legally Blonde @ 7:30 at Edwards Cinema off of 59 and Weslayan. I am going to go buy 4 tickets after work unless I here from you otherwise by 4pm. Since it is opening night lets plan on meeting at Sue and my apt. @ 6:30. 

See you then.

Hey Lis,

How's married life treating you these days?  I hope things are good with your job, home, etc.  

I was actually writing you to try and get Bonnie's email address.  My friend Monique and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.

Hope to see you soon and please say, "Hi!" to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.  I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time Clay sent the email.

Love,
Sue

I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott (sscott3@enron.com)..=
.I'm with nat gas trading.

Thanks

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to =
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC lic=
enses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF =
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In=
 most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless thei=
r primary business is as a utility, like Enron). =20

In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform c=
ertain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site gen=
eration customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let y=
ou know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

Christi-

This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
thorization.  The answer is no.

With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
 governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
 commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
reference thereto."

Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
state agencies and municipalities.

With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
 exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
 rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
 a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
 status is lost.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hi Bonnie,

How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

Thanks a bunch,
Susan

It's so nice to hear from you!

Actually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San Juan's (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.

Thanks again,
Susan

we should definitely get together. so when are yall coming? where are
you staying? i have a lot of suggestions, as i have done the whole
touristy thing here in seattle when i first moved here.

i am betting you are staying downtown or near downtown which is
perfect/. and getting around seattle is easy- you can either take bus,
or if you dont feel like it, you can always take cabs as they are
readily available in the downtown area.

you must see pike place market--- its downtown on the waterfront, where
they have fresh fish, etc/ very neat/

then there is the experience music project, an awesome museum -
literally like nothing you have ever seen before. very interesting.

for outdoor stuff, i would say Discovery Park, which is about a 15
minute drive from downtown.  it is beautiful.

write me and let me know when you and your co worker are coming (as in,
what weekend)--- i hope it is a weekend that i am planning to be here! i
would love to meet up.

let me know

Hey folks,

It's harassment time.  I'm trying to put together the contact list to end all contact lists.  I was hoping you guys could help me out by filling in any of the info you may already have.  I've attached an excel file which has plants, pipelines and storage facilities.  Fill in whatever you can and feel free to add anything you think should be included.  Just take a look at the sheet when you get a chance and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for all the help,
Susan

 

I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back Emily Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  Hope the paper(s) is/are going well.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

PS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.

bonjour girls- am relishing the balmy london weather- today: 73 degrees and
breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in london.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.  now he's
coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's "helping" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #s.  kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little
hostesses!

I actually think we have the Monday off (Sept. 3).  So, ideally I'd fly in Friday evening and fly out Monday afternoon.  I'll email more later, but just thought I'd give you a heads up.

Susan

hi susan-  sorry i missed your call on sunday!  i was totally hung over and
lying on the beach, and my cell phone doesn't always get reception
there.  labor day definitely works for me- call me if you want to today to
discuss, or we can email and work everything out that way.  i have no plans
as of now, so whatever works for you, works for me!  i can take off friday,
if necessary, or you can fly in friday afternoon or friday evening and we
can have all day friday, saturday, and most of sunday.

hope you had a fun weekend- can't wait to see you again!

julie

Thanks Bonnie...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a call on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday though since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.

Susan

hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.  when
i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have info
on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to try
seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
helpful

i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
weekend unfortunately....

i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
do!

the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle you
never know.

my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night- believe
me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it could
get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on friday.
the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me anytime
on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
message and ill call you back.

very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

oh, where are you staying?

perfect timing!  AND- i did get an email from jim saying he prob couldn't go
out this weekend anyways, since the production time was so short- but maybe
a chance to tonight (wednesday) after the show.  depending on your plans, he
could make for a very interesting wild card in the situation.....very
wealthy, attractive, successful, mid-30's LA producer/writer w/ house on
hermosa beach.....not a guy I'D want to have to compete with- makes a
twenty-something energy trader from nw coast w/ school teacher finacee sem
pretty lame!  just a thought.....am knee deep in copyright articles rt now-
if you happen to come across any news relating to european patent law,
digital images,fine art and ethics, pass them my way!

definitely ted actions...served no purpose, just made me feel rotten and reiterated what an ass he is/was.  He actually said he can't inter-company date b/c is costs him money if he does ($60 a date).  I told him it was a good thing he got so much in when he could.

   

ted actions or others?

Sue,

I did not feel well this morning.  How are you doing?

Hey...if you'd like to try and get together Thursday or Friday let me know.  I think a group is actually getting together Friday night for Ashlea Stuart's birthday, but I'd be willing to skip it (or go if you'd like to see some people).  Anyway, just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session.

Sue

Hey Theresa....are you going to be putting in the Thermo volumes or would you like me too?

I've decided the articles on MSN are crap and you shouldn't read them anymore....but this one made me laugh.

http://womencentral.msn.com/weddings/articles/artfeed2.asp

   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

I'm a stone

the king is dead
and the queen has flown
left me here in the

without a heart
without even a soul
I'll be coal

I won't be blood &

I heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....

As for me, the trip was fantastic.  Mucho shopping and even more eating.  Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.  The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite Austin vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.

Sue

hey- haven't heard from you in a while!  how was the big trip?  did you
survive the plane flight from hell back home?  and the weather....was it
pretty or london dreary?  see the kurt cobain house?  what?

Good luck with the paper...I know how inspired you get when deadlines start approaching, so I'm sure it'll be fabulous.  Sorry about the pulled muscle.  What exactly does that do to the marathon plans?  Will you be able to compete still, or are you just going to hit all the wine stops now?  

I think you're right about Katy's move to Dallas. I have a feeling she's actually going to really like being there and working.  I pretty sure the folks are still helping out with living expenses, etc. so she won't have to make too big of an adjustment right off the bat.  

As for me, Seattle could definitely be a destination but it would require a job change.  Enron doesn't have any offices up there.  The closest office is Portland and for obvious and now unavoidable reasons I don't see a move there any time soon.  You are right about not being able to go wrong with a place possessing Austin-like qualities...they are highly desirable.

I will most certainly try to keep the September date open...it would be great to see Britney and Arden.  We had Susan E.'s bachelorette party Saturday night (plus a bridal shower earlier that day).  Lisa hosted Laura White's at the apartment the same night.  I got to see and visit with Jenny Kenair (sp?), Janie Pitman, Rachel Pack among others.  Very interesting.  The two bachelorette parties met up at Black Swan for late night dancing.  Lis was in rare form.  I knew it was bad when she ran up and started hugging me....I think she almost crushed Susan and Kelly.  Anyway, it was actually pretty fun and I've decided I really like Susan's sister Betsy...good sense of humor and not at all be-boppy.  I did manage to trick her into doing the V-I-C-T-O-R-Y cheer at Black Swan though.  I thought it was pretty darn funny myself...she was mortified when she realized I'd got her to do a cheer.

Once again...best of luck banging out your opus.  Talk to you soon.

Sue

If you're looking to procrastinate a little this evening you can give me a buzz on my cell.  I'd try calling 5 pm or after.

glad the trip was so smashing.  am pouting rt now b/c have to finish next
law paper by tues- while evryone else travels.  liz and kerrie are in
stockholm, mom and dad in colorado...me stuck, w/ pulled groin muscle, and
am hobbling around like a circus freak.  sounds like kates is off to dallas.
  think she's definitely ready for a chge of scenery.  and she's waited long
enough!  would seattle be a potential destination?  could you do your same
job there?  i guess so.  could be really fab- i'm up for anyone from the grp
offering alternative vacation destinations.  everyone always raves about
seattle- isn't that were the begining of the ashley judd film double
jeopardy takes place?  gorgeous!  plus, if it has austin-like qualities, how
could you go wrong?  like kates, you may be in need of a chge of scenery-
even if it were just for a yr or so.....what will prob happen is kates will
move to dallas, you'll move to seattle, and the next day i'll be offered
curator position or dream art law job in houston starting at about $
100,000+......then it will be me and the marrieds alone, stuck in houston!
NB kitchen has been totally renovated- mom said it looks totally different,
but can't really imagine it.  may be meeting brit and arden in NB sept 15-
save the date just in case it becomes a big party..... ok, am off.  rented
the house of mirth...again.  i really liked it for some reason....ok, chat
soon-

Hello Susan -

This is Bobby here at Enron. I work in retail power in EES.

We met  ages ago here in Houston.
I started working here at Enron a month ago.

I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.

Hope things are good on your end.

Bobby

ps. If you see Joel Bennett around, tell him I said hi. (I can't remember which floor he's on.)

Sorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.  I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.  Pitiful but much needed.  Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.  Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.  You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.  And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.  I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.

Sue 

get online (msngr) if you get a chance...i'm still at work.

Susan, 
If you leave on Tuesday the 14th, you will arrive on the 15th here.  That part is fine.  However, if you leave on the following Sunday, you'll be back into Houston Sunday.  Here is the tenative itenerary: 
Looks like Continental leaving Tues Aug 14 going from Intercontinental to LAX 0940-1105. 
Korean Air from LA to Korea at 1230.  You would arrive on Wed evening (the 15th) at 5:05pm. 
Leaving Sunday would put you on a flight leaving Korea at 5:30 pm on the 26th and arriving to LA at 
1:00 in the afternoon and leaving again on Continental at 3:30 and arriving in Houston at 9:00pm 
Sunday night. 
Let me know how that sounds.

It all sounds pretty good, but is there any way to get on an earlier flight Sunday?  Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into Houston closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.  I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.

sounds good....i'd rather be useless a day at work, than miss a day over there....in the grand scheme of life.

Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday.  I will ask though.  You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and leaving Korea on Sunday).  The total air fare should be $962.  Shoot me a quick e mail if this is not ok.  Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing your tickets this afternoon.  Thanks!
-Chris

Congrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager...I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director.  All things in due time, right?

Great....sounds good to me.  Can't wait to see you guys.

I changed the time.  You will get in around 6:00 pm on Sunday now, and only leave Korea 30 minutes earlier.  I'll e-mail you the entire itenerary tomorrow morning (my time) for your final approval.  I will buy the tickets after you have a chance to give the times one more look.

Thanks

I just got a call from Susan Ginsberg at El Paso.  It seems they have heard from FERC staff that INGAA is showing up an awful lot to talk about the marketing affiliate rule and why there should not be any changes, but they wonder why, if they really are separate companies, the affiliates have not been in to talk to FERC themselves.  I think we have already heard this message, but El Paso wants to set up a group to go into FERC.  THey are setting up a conference call for next Thur with some other companies to discuss this issue.  I told them we would be in on the call (we don't have to, tho) but that we may not want to go into FERC with that group.  

Would anyone like to be on the call next week, or have any problem with my participation in the call?  Shall we talk about going to FERC to give them our position?  (or should we just tell them to read our comments)

Leslie --

Makes sense for at least you to be in on the call (probably good to have Donna F. on as well).  I agree that we need to be discussing with FERC our positions on this.

ARE YOU A BITCH????? 
Some friends were sitting at the bar talking about their professions. 
The first guy says "I'm a Y.U.P.P.I.E, you know.... 
Young, Urban, Professional, Peaceful; Intelligent; Ecologist" 
The second guy says "I'm a D.I.N.K, you know.... 
Double Income, No Kids." 
The third guy says, "I'm a R.U.B., you know... 
Rich, Urban, Biker." 
They turn to the woman and ask her, "What are you?" 
She replies: "I'm a WIFE, you know.... 
Wash, Iron, F***, Etc." 
A second gal answers their question before they even ask it: 
"BITCH "So, just exactly what is a BITCH??????????" They ask in unison. 
* B- BABE 
* I- IN 
* T- TOTAL 
* C- CONTROL of 
* H- HERSELF 
> 
So ladies, next time somebody calls you "Bitch"...SMILE......and say Thank 
You!!!!!!!! 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY! 
PASS THIS ONE ON TO AS MANY WOMEN AS YOU KNOW! 

hello....long time no see.  how are y'all doing these days?

i'm actually writing bc i've misplaced em's phone number in london and wanted to give her a buzz.  do either of you have it on hand?  if so, could you please email it back to me.  thanks

em also mentioned something about NB in mid Sept...i'd love to see y'all if you decide to meet up with her.  

Susan

UGH....sorry i missed your call last night.  I can't find your phone number either...i'll give you a call if you email it to me. otherwise, just give me a call later today.

ok- am really planning on calling tonight.  have to admit, the movies on tv
the past two nights have sent niki and i into professional veg mode til the
wee hours....are you going to susan edwards' wedding?  i think we were all
invited- hate that i'm going to miss it- think it's going to be fun!  first
night bk to boot camp at almost 100%...not bad, but still stuck in the
beginner's grp.  looks like a bunch of people who didn't quite make it into
athletics in jr high....i feel like an olympic athlete in comparison.  won't
be such an ego boost to head back to advanced grp and last place in every
wind sprint.  am currently watching old ally mc beal re-runs.  i REALLY like
that british guy, brian, she dated for a while....damn!  he's precious.  ok-
mind is wandering.  you'll be VERY excited to hear of my latest whim- cross
stitching.  but cross stitching w/ a purpose, of course.  M & D's 30th
anniversary is in december, and thought i'd do an anniversary sampler for
it.  will prob take me that long just to do the border....ok.  am off.
again- baring any fabulous , unmissable tv options, will try to call later!

Thanks anyway...I eventually tracked it down yesterday.  

And yes, the real world emphatically sucks.  Emily's got the right idea, avoid it at all costs.  Still, work's going all right for me.  My hours have dramatically improved, which is nice, and they actually let me take time off for vacation.  I'm reserving the weekend Emily mentioned in September so hopefully I'll see you there.

Susan

Hey Susan-
I don't have Emily's number.  I am 100% useless.  I just started school
today.  Wow!!  How's work going?  The real world sucks.  I would love to see
you in September in NB.
Brittany

I'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within Enron.  I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times.  I'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in Denver, but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great.

hi Susan,

My name is Aarati Siva, and I'm a summer analyst intern in EES (with the Load desk within Commodity Risk Management).  Priya Jaisinghani suggested I contact you when I mentioned to her that I'd like to talk to a couple of people  to find out more about Enron and its different businesses. 
 I don't know if Priya told you, but I met her when she came down to represent Enron at our school last semester (the University of Virginia).  I caught up with her a few weeks ago over lunch, which is when she suggested some analyst resources for me to speak with.  I'm a finance/economics major and hope to work here full time next year (if I get an offer!)...but I still am not sure where I'd like to work within Enron.   I was wondering if you had the time to tell me a little bit about what you're doing, and how you're liking it so far?  She told me you traded gas, and I'm eager to find out about trading opportunities, in particular, so I thought it would be wise to talk to someone currently involved with that.  If its not possible that's not a problem, I understand its a busy time for everybody just about now.  But if you could that'd be great - it wouldn't have to be long, I just wanted to get a little direction and advice from people who've worked in different places.  Thanks!

Cheers,
Aarati 
  

Sorry it took me so long to respond.  It's been really busy here lately.  You're going to be so disappointed in us, but we never ended up kayaking.  Monique and I were so glad that you and Luke came to meet us for drinks.  It was so fun getting to talk to y'all and hear all about Seattle and Vancouver.

The weather actually turned out to be really good so we spent a lot of time outside.  The Market was fantastic.  We actually bought some boiled shrimp there and took in back to the hotel for a little in room picnic.  We also hit "the Bite" which was really neat.

Glad you and Luke had a good time in the mountains and please let me know the next time you're in Houston.  It be great to see you again.

Thanks again for everything,
Susan

Tell me about the rest of your trip/

it was so fun seeing you again and meeting monique. luke and i both had
a really good time

i want to hear all about kayaking, etc as i have not yet tried it in
seattle.

hope the weather was nice. we were up in the mountains and it was chilly
and kind of cloudy (but really nice- we saw a black bear and a few
rainbows)- just gorgeous

now back to hot and sunny down in houston, huh???

well i hope yall had fun and it was great seeing yuo

maybe i will see you soon, if i can ever get to going down to houston to
see brad and lisa and my little sister

Take care
bonnie

Thanks Bonnie...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a
call
on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday
though
since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.

Susan

   hey i emailed one of my friends and asked her about kayaking,etc.
when
   i get a chancce i will look up some internet sights that might have
info
   on that sort of thing in seattle. if you have a sec, you may want to
try
   seattleinsider.com--- i think they are supposed to be pretty good and
   helpful

   i havent talked to luke yet, so i dont exactly know my plans for the
   weekend unfortunately....

   i am thinking that i will head to whistler on early saturday morning,
   and that way i can go to dinner with you and your friend on friday
   night, or head out and have drinks, or both, or whatever yall want to
   do!

   the weather is supposed to be great this weekend, but with seattle
you
   never know.

   my MAJOR SUGGESTION is that you bring some sort of light jacket for
   sure, or a pullover or something. it gets so darn cold at night-
believe
   me you will be glad.  plus on the ferry ride over to san juans it
could
   get kind of chilly if you are sitting outside.

   ive already given you my cell phone number i think (206.851.9177)
   definitely call me when you get in town on thursday night or on
friday.
   the number i have given you is my cell phone and you can call me
anytime
   on it. if i dont answer, i check it frequently and you can leave a
   message and ill call you back.

   very exciting to have visitors from texas. see you friday hopefully.

   oh, where are you staying?

   Hi Bonnie,

   How are you doing?  Lisa said you'd broken your foot recently and
have
   been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're
riding
   public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might
have
   some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.
One
   of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend
in
   your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're
   still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks
   like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing
   for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to
   offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to
live
   in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of
a
   research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions
for
   restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and
   maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.

   Thanks a bunch,
   Susan

Sorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night, but I hope you had fun at steak night.  It's too bad you didn't make it to Sierra's ( you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly).

Paul,

So nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell Nathan I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?

Have a nice time at the wedding,
Susan

Hey Susan,

I hope things are going great!

Do you remember Nathan Thomas?  He is getting married
on August 11th(I will be one of the groomsmen).

I thought you might be interested.

Have fun,
Paul

PS - How are things going?

oh im SOOO glad the weather was good.

i am not disappointed that you didnt go kayaking- are you kidding? ive
been here 6 months and havent done it yet!
so glad yall liked the market and "the bite"...

i think the seattle market is so neat. some of those people travel 2
hours every day to get to seattle to sell their fruits, flowers, etc.
alot of them are asian immigrants just trying to "make it" in america-
all the "stalls" where they sell fish, etc are great small business
success stories. that's why i like supporting it...

take care

Hey Ted,

Do I even know this guy, or has someone yet again confused me with the other Susan Scott?  Since your one of the only names on this thing I recognize, besides Margaret's, I thought I'd ask.

Susan

Start crying because our John Neslage is moving on to bigger and better opportunities.  Of course, he has to travel the globe for two months to recover from leaving us, but Friday, August 10, is our last opportunity - at least on a daily basis - to see his smiling face. His innate ability to make us laugh will be sorely missed!

So, in between the kleenex, hugs and kisses, we are going throw back a few drinks in his honor!   Please join us Friday, 6:00 p.m. for Happy Hour at Kenneally's on 2111 Shepherd (between San Felipe and Fairview; across the street from Petsmart).

Bring friends - the more the merrier!

Just wondering why my ice cream and bean burritos were in the frig instead of the freezer last night....you come up with some new storage methods?

So what are you up to tonight?

Sue

For you....

I know, I know....I dropped off the face of the earth for a while.  I've actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.  So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what other dates in September look good to you.

Susan

hi susan-  are you there?  or are you on some exotic vacation?  hope all is going well!
julie
hi susan-  how are you?  have you firmed up any plans for labor day?  hope you're coming to visit!  write back when you can!
julie 

Also for you....

susan - this is re tex-mex - I'll stop by or call to discuss

You were not on the attached fax.  This relates to the response to CPL for TexMex.  Scott Laidlaw has provided some comments.  He proposes a conference call tomorrow at 1pm CST.

Another misdirected email.....
 

I'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.  However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.  I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S. Korea so it should be interesting.  Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.

Thanks Susan.  I'm in the middle of my official Enron name change, so you might get a few e-mails for me in the next few weeks.
Never change your name at this company; it is the biggest nightmare!

Are you going to be in Austin next weekend (the 28th)?  I'm thinking about making a trip up there to visit.  Let me know.

Sue

Hey...was wondering if you want to split this month's electricity bill...

Last month was $175.00, this month is $183.00 and we've also started paying for water (which was only about $20 last month).  Anyway, just let me know...I won't make the full check out now if you want to split.

Sue

Charles Bradley & Sally Scott
10802 Jaycreek
Houston, TX 77070

I'll try giving you a call tonight just to catch up and see how things are going.  Were you planning on going walking?

Sue

... KOREA!?!?!  Eh?  Well, no can say your life isn't exciting!  Wow, I
can't wait to hear about it!

I got your message Saturday.  I was in Austin and Matt and I were actually
registering at Breed & Co. when you called... sorry I missed you!

No worries about the music... we just need to get together soon!  AND, no
worries about the bachelorette party... I would definitely say Korea's
slightly more enticing! :o)

When you have a minute could I get your dad's full name and your parent's
address?

Thanks friend -- I HOPE to hear from you soon!

Love,

Jen

Becca,

I am sooooo sorry I'm not going to be able to make the party.  Please give everyone my best and tell Jen I would have done everything within my power to embarass her.  I'm actually going to be in S. Korea visiting my brother and sister-in-law, so I do have a legitimate excuse.

See you at the wedding if not before.

Susan

I'm flying out for Korea tomorrow morning, but give me a call when you get home from your meeting...I'm sure I'll still be packing.

Thanks Sue!  I might be able to go walking depending on when I can get out
of here.. I have a meeting at 7:30 though... what about Wed. or Thurs.
night?

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!	

That's wonderful news....I think Laura is such a fantastic girl and I wish them both the very best.

My brother is getting married!!!!  Chas and Laura got engaged last week!!
They have not set an official date yet, but probably sometime at the
beginning of next year!  Just wanted to share the good news with all of
you!

Thanks Ash...I actually don't think I'm going to go, but if I change my mind at the last minute I will definitely take you up on it.  Talk to you soon.

We really are going to have to get together with all of the married couples roaming about...

Hey there,

Have a fun trip to Korea!!

Stephanie and I will absolutely pick you up at the airport on Saturday in
SLC if you decide to come in.  Katy said her flight gets in about 12:00 or
1:00pm, so it is no problem at all.  We are flying Delta #1895 out of IAH
and get in at 4:55 that Friday.  We are staying at the hotel the rehearsal
dinner is at, so we figured we would have time to shower and get ready.  I
was planning on working a 1/2 day that day.  We are leaving early that
Sunday morning, but Katy said she would get her own car that day.

Just let one of us know when you get in if you decide to go...

Talk to you later,
Ashley

If you email me while I'm out of town, go ahead and sent it to my hotmail account...susan_m_scott@hotmail.com

I will definitely do my best to make it out there before October.

HI Susan-
That's totally fine- I completely understand.  I was considering going up to  Ventura to visit a friend for the weekend, but of course didn't want to make any plans until I heard from you.  Sounds like you have a lot of fun events coming up!  I'll email you- there might be 2 other weekends that work for me - unfortunately time is flying SO fast!!  But even if you can't come out before the end of October, we'll have to plan some time to get together soon....I'll send you those dates later.
Have a safe trip to Korea, busy girl! glad to hear that all is going well with you!

actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for
Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm
leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend
before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to
make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that
same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.
So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different
weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what
other dates in September look good to you.

You've got the wrong Susan Scott...you may want to try her married name (which I, unfortunately, don't know).

JD,

To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:

	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement

nope...dinner...bed

you do anything last night

I think it's probably a good idea not to contact Eric for a while.  Truly what purpose would it serve?  As for my work situations, they aren't that exciting but have made for some highly uncomfortable moments for me.  I'll tell you about them on my next visit.  See, I've already come up with a reason why I have to come back out there.  Please don't worry about flapping Sat night.  I certainly do not think less of you and completely agree about the life lessons part.  To tell the truth, I worry at times that I'm not learning enough of the life lessons...just kind of staying in a very safe, secure place and missing out on a big part of the overall picture.  Enough self-analysis.  Have a good evening....you should his jazz night at Epizote just for me.

Sue

   

how fun- i totally forgot that you're off to vegas this weekend!  thanks for the input about clint- you're right, and i hadn't realized that i fit his "type" until he defined it.   now i know why he's so nice to me!  he does know about brendan, of course, but since i don't always behave like i have a boyfriend it's easy for guys to not take him too seriously.....not good.  i'm also embarrassed that i flapped away in the car on saturday night- hope you don't think horrible things about me.  although it's okay if you do- i think horrible things about myself every now and then! but i always attribute it to the lessons of life.....i'm curious about your work situations- you've never mentioned them.  that is truly uncomfortable and i have not had to deal with that here.....

keep me posted on your exciting life!  otherwise, i'm doing the right thing to not contact eric, right?  so silly for me to ask, but i like being friends with him (probably the flirting is fun), but it's a dead end.....

I think there's probably a lot of truth to the Eric theory.  The
retaliation/numbing afforded by using people and tossing them aside can be
tempting.  My  mini-rampage after Ted was totally based upon treating any
representative of Ted's sex like dirt.  Fortunately, my behavior was very
short-lived and I completely recognized what I was doing.  I wouldn't worry
about the lecturing...it happens when one has a bit to drink (that or just
utter flapping as in my case).

Thanks for the compliments, but I find it's easy to be around all of your
friends...that whole like attracts like thing.  As for the email from
Clint, he's a cutie.  Speaking from experience I'd watch myself if I were
you though...the flirtation is fun and harmless at this point, but I get
the impression that you're just Clint's type and unless you have reciprocal
interest I would just guard against things getting to be too flirtatious.
However, if there's part of you that is curious, like I said, I think he's
a great guy.  Okay, enough of my lecturing (I've just been caught in 
couple of situations at work where someone decides to confess their
feelings to me and I'm forced to tell them I just don't feel the same
way...something that's hard for them to grasp given the fact that some
flirting at some point did occur).

Well, I'm off to Vegas this weekend.  My guess is I won't be getting much
sleep.  Oh well, life is tough.

hey susan-  thought you'd appreciate this funny email from Clint in
London....  so in brief, my new theory is that eric gomez has had his heart
broken (per "Someone Like You") and therefore must act like a slut to
ignore the pain.  Heather and I ran that theory past Randall last night at
the padres game.....i am slightly mortified at how i lectured eric on
saturday.  at first he thought it was sweet because it demonstrated that i
do care about him (on some level), but as i drank more i LECTURE more,
until he finally started walking away from me!  how embarrassing!  i am
totally embarrassed that i wouldn't shut up!  even more surprised that eric
sent me the email on monday.  i didn't see it until tuesday since i didn't
work monday, but am bummed because i called him monday evening to get eric
ang's phone number.....silly concern, but he probably thinks i was calling
just to get in touch with him.  now  i will totally not make contact with
him- not even respond to his email...don't need to overinflate people's
egos!

i would love if you came back to visit at some point in the next 5 or so
months!! i love that you have so much fun here, and everyone always
comments on how cool you are and how easy you are to be around.....everyone
would be thrilled to have you back! (me especially!)  i'll watch for good
fares, too!

write back whenever you can....talk to you soon-

thanks! tell them that i had a great time, also. i will be back friday
afternoon. i may need to hang out at the beach to recover from the jet lag.
jeff was very curious and mentioned to a colleague in london that i had
very good company at the beach.  i assured him that you were not married--
he was confused by your ring-- and so was i when i first saw you cruising
the halls. he thought we must be dating but i straighted him out. told him
that you were all over me at the beach after he left (just kidding!)

so are you taking friday off?

Julie,

Thanks for letting us hang out with you on the beach Sat.  It was good to
see you.  All your friends are very cool.  Say thanks to Clint for me if
you
get the chance.  We didn't last much longer that night, thank goodness.
I hope you had a nice Easter.  Other than the Lakers beating the Blazers it
was a pretty boring day.  Not to mention I was brain dead from the pickling
the two days before.
Have a good week.

Eric

did you finally talk to him today?

i'm definitely interested in the movie/dinner (i have a couple things in mind) but it probably won't be till around 8 o'clock or so...if that's ok with you.

i just think hes precious.

anyway, i still have a movie to watch tonight if you are interested in us trying to whip up something for dinner and plop in front of the tv?

unfortunate...but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for.

off the soapbox....

i'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.

sure....consider it done
oohhh... if you are going to the grocery store, could you please pick up a small jar of dijonnaise for me?

Here's the latest on El Paso line #1110...

Line #1110 is expected to be back online during this week following the installation of a release valve.
Sources at El Paso report that when #1110 comes back up, there will be no significant increase of capacity flowing through the South Main Line System because there is currently no market demand for the increase.
The OPS corrective action order is expected to be lifted later this fall, thereby granting the system permission to return to full capacity. However, there is a possibility that El Paso will not increase capacity on the system even then. This will depend on market demand at that time.

We will continue to follow this situation and will update you as significant developments occur. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Susan!

I feel terrible that I haven't talked to you in so long.  Third year of med
school is a little on the crazy side!  I've been wanting to call you, but for
some reason, I can't find your phone number.  I called information, and tried
to call a Susan Scott in Houston, but I wasn't sure if it was the right one of
not.  (There were several)  So, just email your phone number to me (and your
address if you don't mind--I don't have your current one), and I will call you
tomorrow sometime--I'm on call tonight, so I won't be home until very late!

I hope you're doing well and not having to work so, so hard these days!  I
miss you and all the girls--we need a reunion soon!  Take care!

Love,
Elizabeth

Hey girls!  I can't believe I missed seeing y'all this weekend!  I'm so
sad............Farrell and I had to leave early the next morning cause he
had work - it's football season!  I told y'all he got a new job, right??
He is the JV Defensive Coordinator at Highland Park!  He loves it!
I would love to get together with y'all soon.  I will be in Austin this
weekend (and for all of the home games).  Are you going to Austin  for the
game this weekend, Susan?  Let's try and make plans to do something!
I can't believe that Elizabeth is engaged - I am so happy for her!  I
called her yesterday and left a message.  Do y'all know any details about
the wedding, etc.?  Chas and Laura have set their date - April 20, 2002!
We are all so excited!
Let me know what y'all's plans are for this weekend!
Miss you!
Steph

Sue-Sue,
We loved seeing you this weekend.  I am catatonic today, but it was a fun
night.  Thank you so much for the gift bags and the wonderful rooster and
turtle.  I love the bags and the figurines are adorable.  The kids love
their watches.  I just had to strap Mack's on for bedtime!!  He told me that
it was 7 o'clock all day today.  Thanks again and we'll see you in Austin or
Houston soon! Love, Kathy

In order that people may be happy in their work, these three things are
needed: they must be fit for it; they must not do too much of it; and they
must have a sense of success in it. -John Ruskin, author, art critic, and
social reformer (1819-1900)

I swore I would be one of those people who said never and really meant it.   
Well, I guess "they" are right . . .     
Clay and I have some news.  (No, I am not pregnant.)  But, we are buying a  
house in Dallas.  We close on it two days after my arrival in London.   
Thankfully, Clay will still be here.  We will rent it out over the next year  
while we are away.  Our move in date will be sometime next summer, depending  
on our tenants' situation.   
So, about the never say never part.  The house is in south Highland Park.   
Gasp!  We never expected to buy a house this soon.  And, I NEVER--I repeat  
NEVER-- expected that we would move to Highland Park upon graduating from law  
school, if EVER!  In fact, it was a condition of our marriage--I knew that we  
were going to end up in Dallas, but I made Clay promise that we would not  
have to settle in the Park Cities.  He promised, crossed his heart, hoped to  
die, and the whole bit.  All summer, we have been neighborhood shopping in  
Lakewood and East Dallas, an area that is close to downtown with wonderful  
homes and a sort of Austiny-feel.    
We spent some time checking out real estate cites on the web during our  
down-time at work, on a strictly just-for-fun basis.  We loved looking at  
older homes.  We dreamed about eventually getting something that was very  
livible for the time being but that would be really fun to update and  
restore.  Independently, we both came across a house in south east Highland  
Park (near the McKinney and Knox Henderson area) that was built in 1925 in  
the Craftsman style--our favorite.  We drove by it and checked it out on the  
internet for about three weeks.  Finally, we decided to call up a realtor and  
go see it.  We immediately fell in love--wood floors, beautiful original  
fixtures and "rookwood" fireplace, 9 foot ceilings, great backyard, etc.     
During the three week period, I had a huge and slightly dramatic internal  
debate about living in this area.  Would this mean I was destined to a life  
of suburban-driving, PTA morning, bubble head-ism???  Would we ever be able  
to escape our parents who live merely 5-7 minutes away?  Was I, deep-down,  
really a total snob?  If not, would I become one?  Would I have to go to the  
neighborhood Tom Thumb?  Would I become my mother?  
The bottom line was that we loved the house--the craftsman style lets us to  
combine Clay's desire for traditionalism and my love for modern design.  (In  
other words, it's a place where my red leather couch and his stuffed deer  
head might live comfortable together.)  Also, we really loved the location (6  
minutes from Downtown; right by our favorite restaurants and bar spots; and  
very close to the Katy Trail--Dallas' jogging biking trail).  So, I decided  
that we could make  Park Cities life work. . . I would just have to  
concentrates on the things that I always have said I WILL do, rather than the  
things I have said I would NEVER do.  I will invest in the lives of needy  
people; I will keep painting; I will remember that people, instead of things,  
make the world go 'round.   
After much prayer and consideration, Clay and I put down a REALLY low-ball  
offer on the house.  We negotiated for about a week, and the sellers finally  
accepted our offer.  We feel terribly blessed, and our prayer is that our  
home can be put to use for God's purposes.  (And, perhaps, a TX-OU party??)   
I am thankful for a husband who was fortunate enough to save every penny he  
ever earned and every little birthday check he ever received--and for a  
father-in-law who helped us get an excellent interest rate.   
So, that's the news . . . let the making fun of Jessica begin . . . I  
certainly deserve it.  Too bad I am leaving the country in a matter of  
days!!!    
Hope you guys are doing well.  I will have email in London, so shoot me one  
whenever possible!  You can reach me via Clay's cell phone until Friday  
(214)649-6914.  Sorry this message was so long.  Much love and big hugs to  
you all. 
Bate :) 
  

Folks:

Many thanks for the last two years of Enron experience. Friday morning will be my final day here in Houston and I wanted to drop a contact address if there is anything you need or should you find yourself in England in the next 1-3 years. Best wishes to all of you.

Well its been a very long time.  A lot has transpired since my last ever-po=
pular Friday State of the Union.  As usual my friends and I have been up to=
 no good and, fortunately for you, I am ready and willing to tell you all a=
bout it. There are so many people and things to talk about and only one Sta=
te of the Union to cover it all.  This could be a very rough ride so, as al=
ways, Brace Yourself!!!

Multiple choice question:  Which one of the these airport names does not be=
long? A) Reagan International Airport  B) Bush Intercontinental Airport C) =
JFK Airport D) Louis Armstrong National Airport.  Well in case you are stum=
ped, here is a little hint: think "Satchmo."  Chris Coulon (my political in=
sider) told me that the city of New Orleans had narrowed it down to two cho=
ices: Edwin Edwards National Airport or Louis Armstrong National Airport.  =
Well it was a close race but considering Edwin Edwards was convicted last y=
ear of numerous counts of bribery and extortion; the City of New Orleans de=
cided on Louis Armstrong.  So now every time you fly into "Satchmo" make su=
re you high-five a friend as you pass that beautiful picture of Chris Owens=
 and her 60-year old breasts because you are now in New Orleans, a place wh=
ere absolutely nothing gets taken serious.

Speaking of New Orleans, has anyone read the book Confederacy of Dunces?  N=
ow that he lives in the French Quarter, Granola Centola truly personifies t=
he book's main character, Ignatius Reilly.  Just last weekend, while walkin=
g back to his apartment from Cat's Meow, Larry felt the need to relieve him=
self next to a neighbor's car(what a way to build neighborhood friendships!=
).  While in "mid-stream," Larry got picked up by a policeman and dragged o=
ff to the Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) for indecent exposure and public drun=
kenness.  When I asked Larry what it was like to spend the night in the "Bl=
ack Bar Hotel" his response was, "It wasn't that bad I talked politics the =
whole night with my cell-mates," and he added, "the best thing was that the=
y (cell-mates) were all Democrats.  Can you believe it?"  Yes, Larry, we ca=
n believe that all your cell-mates were Democrats.=20

Well if you haven't already heard Shawn (The Wop) has moved back into Beau =
Chene College Apartments.  This move has made Shawn a target for jokes amon=
gst most of our friends.  Thankfully, Shawn takes these comments with a gra=
in of salt and even recently commented to me that "I (Shawn) love living in=
 Beau Chene, especially since I have been included in Jeff Jordan's (Landlo=
rd's) Monday Night Football parties."  Shawn says there is only two require=
ments to get into this party: 1) you must be a guy and 2) you must B.Y.O.C =
(Bring Your Own Cold Cuts).  Shawn says that no one seems to like his ham o=
r turkey and that for some reason there tends to be an enormous amount of S=
alami at these parties.  Shawn says it never fails, whenever Jeff introduce=
s him as an old FIJI  to someone at the party, the first question is always=
 "Do you know Nick Nesbit and the Turner Twins?" and the second question is=
 "Do you like Salami?"  Word to the wise, Shawn, you might want to rethink =
the meaning of the "C" part  in B.Y.O.C.

While most of Houston wants the 2012 Summer Olympics in Houston so they can=
 watch the events, the girl I went on a date with a few weeks ago wants it =
to come here so she can compete in the Track and Field Events.  Now I am no=
t insecure about my manliness, nor do I consider myself out of shape, but a=
fter having dinner with the "she hulk" I felt pretty damn wimpy.  Thankfull=
y, I had my good buddy Lenhart to pick me up from my deep depression.  We w=
ent out the following Thursday night to Houston's Latest Hot Spot, TACO MIL=
AGRO.  Since Matt had  a very bad case of Laryngitis, we worked as a team; =
I talked to all of the girls and Matt just stood there and smiled.  Oddly e=
nough, we got a ton of girls' phone numbers.  Matt couldn't understand it a=
nd even boasted about it the next day, "I (Matt) was on fire last night.  I=
 didn't even say one word the whole night and for some reason I got more ph=
one numbers than ever before!"  Overhearing our conversation, Tim (Paw-Paw)=
 Blanchard chimed in, "It is not a coincidence, dude."

Speaking of Paw-Paw, next Friday Night is Tim's Bachelor Party in Baton Rou=
ge.  As most of you already know, Tim does not have a spontaneous bone in h=
is body, so he took the liberty of e-mailing us his itinerary (See Below!) =
for next Friday night's "Festivities."=20

1) 7:37 PM - Kiss Louise goodbye.
2) 8:43 PM - Drink 2.32 beers with everyone at the Sheraton Hotel in Downto=
wn Baton Rouge.
3)10:26 PM - Drink 3.7 beers at the Gold Club and tell Landry how I (Tim) a=
m not like Lenhart "I (Tim) don't like to get drunk and pick up chicks whil=
e hanging out at the Club." (Note: In case you guys forgot Tim used to be a=
 real partier.  That's how he got the name Paw-Paw...)
4)11:47 PM - Watch Larry pass out at Fred's while dancing to Blind Melon as=
 he proceeds to get into fight with the bouncer.
5)12:56 AM  -  Do one shot with friends and throw the other two shots on th=
e ground when no one else is looking. (Note:  I've actually busted Tim usin=
g this tactic on several occasions)
6) 1:50 AM -  Request "Son of a Preacher Man" at Fred's and look for the cl=
osest Phi-Mu to slow dance with to the song.
7) 2:39 AM -  Bail-out a half drunk Granola Centola from Jail and when he w=
alks out say, "Larry, what the f-ck!?!"
8) 3:27 AM - Kiss Louise good night and dream about the Tigers kicking the =
hell out of Auburn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone have a Good Weekend!

GEAUX TIGERS!

Hey, we just got word that all permanent change of station moves have been suspended.  That probably means that we will not be able to leave Korea tomorrow as scheduled.  No word on when that may change, but we will keep you posted.

i'm here...what's your yahoo msngr name?

where are you?  it's been ages since i heard from you- are you ok?  you know
it makes me nervous when you go AWOL.....matt called this morning and he
sounds really bad.  is doing that oh-so-familiar over-analyzing and
internalizing that would make almost anyone suicidal considering the
situation.  just want to be home so badly.  feel so isolated here.  wish we
were all out on the walker's patio now chatting, and i was with mom and dad
and harls.  i think that's the only place where i'd feel safe and reassured
and as close to happy as i could be right now.  kind of like the way
everyone described josh's funeral.  horrifying, but as good a company to
rebound with as you could find probably.  has been such a long and draining
month emotionally and physically, and am just gutted. hope you're a bit more
buoyant rt now han i am.  am trying to get home asap, but mom and dad don't
want me to fly.  am not worried about it, and am going to try to get on
first flight possible anyways, so may see y'all soon....pls email and let me
know you're still alive and in proportionally good spirits...

I'm doing alright.  And you hit the nail on the head with the Josh comment.=

  Everyone in the Scott household is fine.  Dad actually flew over NY yeste=

 Central Park...no idea how dramatically that skyline would change.  The fi=

landed in Nashville.  He's still in Nashville right now obviously, but he's=
 okay and that's what's important.  I'm hoping with the limited flights the=
y're allowing that Dad will be able to make it back to Houston soon, but it=
 appears the FAA's just trying to get the passengers who are stranded back =
home so he may just be stuck somewhere else as a result.  Chuck and Chris w=
ere supposed to fly out tomorrow morning from Seoul but they too have been =
delayed - indefinitely.  The Army has put a hold on all duty station transf=
ers which means we have no idea when they'll be leaving Korea or where exac=
tly Chuck will be going.  The stories and connections of the people on the =
news and those around me is horrifying and deeply saddening.  A large numbe=
r of people we do business with are based in NY and have lost countless fri=
ends and colleagues in the WTC's destruction.  Chuck has some pledge brothe=
r's who are working up there, but we've heard that both of them are okay.=

I wish you were back home as well....I was on the phone with my Mom off and=
 on all day yesterday and I must say it would've been nice to been back hom=
e on the couch with her.  I did talk to Jen yesterday worried about LA and =
what was going on there, but she was fine as well.  She said they'd shut do=
wn the airport and several major roads surrounding it, but nothing else of =
concern.

We evacuated the Enron building around 9:30 yesterday morning...it was disc=
oncerting.  I walked down the 32 flights of stairs to get to my parking gar=
age and had only one desire...to get out of downtown.  There were rumors fl=
ying that Houston was another target and given the size of our building, ou=
r international presence (esp. in regards to oil/natural gas) and our CEO's=
 connections to the President...I think everyone figured Enron would be a l=
ogical target.  Fortunately, those fears were unfounded.

On a lighter note...I'm very anxious to hear all about your marathon experi=

Love ya,

hey-got your message this morning- was out and about w/ nikki when you
called.  haven't been plugging the phone in lately b/c is not easy to get a
line out to the states still.  no planes to us still this morning, and of
course dad had to send one of his melodramatic doom and gloom emails about
me NOT coming, but am honestly not worried about it.  he's freaking out.
have my fingers crossed that maybe will make it out tomorrow....not much to
report around here- just kind of wandering in a fog, you know?  no longer
absolutely miserable, just numb.  ok- prob about to go back to sleep- had to
wake up at 5 this morn to see if BA was flying out this morning...to no
avail.  chat soon-
e

Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.

My money is on Bass to beat Susan in the shot contest.

CKL

sounds like little woodrow's is the choice.

hull and i will be there at 3 so just come up whenever- just look for the two passed-out drunks at the bar

Little Woodrow's downtown sounds good.  Any objections or other suggestions?

I am and I hear that little woodrow's is having some kind of a party.

ckl

Is anybody up for some drinks after work?

don't know...not positive i'm going....i'll give you a call when i'm about to leave the building

sue, what time are you heading over there?

no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.

and, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature

you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?

No offense :-)

that's exactly the sense of pride in ourselves and our country we need to be displaying right now....go for it!!!

can i take a bunch of shots and crawl into the corner and throw up?

so, its settled then.  
we will meet at woodrow's for some comraderie and no will be forced to partake in shot contests or crawl in the corner and be afraid.

was debating sleeping but don't think i have a choice now...however, due to early morning run i will only be there briefly

are you going to do something or sleep?

odds are you're on the internet right now b/c the hillegeist phone is busy....you are impossible to get a hold of, i must have called 10 times yesterday to no avail.

give me a buzz at work when you get a chance 713-853-1455.  lisa said she emailed you about dinner sometime before you leave, as if without her aid i wouldn't have seen you this visit...ha...anyway, talk to you soon.

Sue

know y'all have been on pins and needles for last 24 hours, but can now
breath great sigh of relief- am home and have resumed position in front of
television (cable!)  will try to get in touch w/ each of you soon...peace
out.

Say they make the offer....what then?

evidently only for a select few

this sucks....can't nom until the internet's up
 
how much would someone have s**t bricks if'd i'd made the same request....actually, the thought of that email response (or lack thereof) is making me laugh right now.
 
 

here's the deal on the arm:

just got bk from france late mon night- had
lots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.  triped on harry potter's cape and
had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the
finish line.  quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a
marathon.  

as for tomorrow...talked to Em this morning and she's on her way to NB to meet with the tile people.  said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  as for tomorrow night, she's waiting to see about grandparents, etc. but may be able to meet if it's early....she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing

sue

do you think em would want to do dinner with everyone? i can definitely make an excuse if not considering we dont know half the people going. if you speak to her let her know about the following and let me know what she would like to do.

hey lis-
i talked to ashley and we have a few people gathered for tomorrow night.  i
think we are meeting at colinas at 6pm.  i think it is maybe in rice
village??  i am going and ashley and susan and stephanie and maybe shelley
and i think 1 or 2 of their old college station friends.  let me know if
that sounds ok with you.  i think that is the name of the restaurant.  ash
picked a place that is less expensive b/c after all these weddings we are
all a bit broke!!  so- let me know- see you later-

i just know how big you are on feeling you owe people sometimes....i just think you have to remove that a bit here

that sounds like a very good plan

oh ok....yeah..i agree...though i want to talk to mike bc i need to know how far he has pushed this through...or how far bobby and mm have.  i just need to explain to mike that i am planning a relocation that involves john and i...a decision together...and that portland is not the only option we are looking at.....just so there is not this expectation that if they offer..i accept.

oh i just meant..i don't want you to add that as another factor to sway you...that just b/c these guys are all pitching in to help you doesn't mean you have to go there if they offer.

oh ok....but the whole thing about obligation..what did you mean?  i'm not mad..i'm just curious

you said you didn't expect it to go to this level this fast...i'm just trying to come up with an explanation of how this happened

i don't understand what you are trying to say...sry....pls elab

yeah...but you know how these guys operate....and mike knows how frustrated you've been here...wants to do anything to help

you look very intense....what happened to the pwr meeting?

like the pendulum would be anything different after one of those...i was considering a position as fry master at Mc D's

i now completely understand suzanne's comments about condescension....i feel it non-stop.

the "watch out"..."maybe i should get my resume together" comments are rubbing me the WRONG way.

i need to give thomas a call...i feel a boxing urge coming on

What's the scoop golf-pro?  Are you in for tonight?  FYI:  The weather is gorgeous outside.

Bobby/Matt,

I spoke with Mike yesterday and he filled me in on his correspondence with both of you.  I appreciate your assistance in identifying potential opportunities for me in Portland.  

John and I are planning a relocation in the near future and I have always had an interest in the Portland office.  Still, this is a fairly involved decision for us and at present we are discussing a number of  options.  Therefore, while I am preparing my resume to forward to your HR rep, I would appreciate it if you could hold off on speaking with Tim for a few days.  That should give me enough time to work through a few of the options with John.  Thanks again for your help.

Mo.

I was hoping you could email me a list of eligible caterers.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

em's with the grandparents tonight...so she's out for dinner...said maybe next week.

still don't know when i'll be getting out of here.

Lisa, I dont have a lot of time, but I'm glad you emailed me, I was planning 
on call you soon to talk to you about this.  You CANNOT go to India.  I'm 
being completely serious.  You know how in favor I was of your trip, but in 
light of recent events and the responses that they will soon yield, you must 
cancel your plans.  I'm being very serious, it will not be safe for you to 
be there at all.  I really hope you take my advice.  Believe me--I know 
about these things.  We'll talk soon.

Check out  the Southwest website if you get a chance...it's got all the data.  I'm going for lowest cost on this sucker if we go, so I may have to forego the fancy hotel in favor of whatever's part of the package.  That way I can spend more on food and drinks.  We can definitely look into a mother/daughter trip.

   

in fact, wouldn't mind making it a mother daughter or mother/sister trip as
well.....makes the $ situation a little less obnoxious pour moi, but would
be jazzed to go w/ ben even prob.....just a thought....

They don't mention India in the 5th paragraph....trying to look on the bright side...:)

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Hi Susan-

so...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...

she left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....

no one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....

emily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....

as for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....

either give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...

sue

are you going to the game tomorrow night?

i'll be in town...wanted to see what your weekend looks like.

emily may be going as well....she'd in town

sue

Hey girls, 

Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

P.S.  Katy...my friend Julie's email address is julieg@qualcomm.com.  I'm sure she'd be happy to answer questions.

sorry i didn't get back to you sooner this week about dinner, but things have been crazy.  my brother and wife left yesterday to drive to kentucky and their new base so most of my free time was spent with family....

susan

Susan,

Do you feel like getting together for dinner this week to catch up?  Let me know when works for you; I'm fairly flexible this week.

Nick

Lisa,

This article's pretty good and it does mention India in some context, so I thought you might be interested.  The India comment is several paragraphs in to the article.

Are you still alive? What's the word? England is grand, though I am gone so

Drop a note as you have time. I tried to contact Emily but alas she has not

Let me know if we have a connection.....

Hi Everyone,

Some of you might be aware that we are planning a Bridal Shower for Jennifer
Bowles on Nov 3rd. Invitations have not yet been sent out so don't be
alarmed if you haven't received one.

The shower will be between the hours of 7-9 (maybe 9:30 p.m.) What we were
thinking about doing afterwards is going to the Mucky Duck and catching
Jimmy LaFave, who is performing at 10 p.m. He is one of Jennifer's favorites
and we thought it would be a nice surprise.

What I need is to know is who all would be interested in going to the show?
Tickets are $15 and we need to get them ASAP. It will probably last until
midnight.

If everyone could please email me back and let me know if you are interested
in going, that would be great.

Please don't mention this to Jennifer, we want to keep it a surprise.

Thank You,
Sarah

that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ Murphy's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....

btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.

you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap

get this......he didn't even wake up!  He had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how Murphy got out of his room.

TXsscott5: i was battling almost everyone claiming that the law of diminishing returns applies even to good, old-fashioned water
joefreid: personally? or from a macroeconomic sense (property rights in the West, blah, blah, blah
TXsscott5: personally, as in water in-take into the human body
TXsscott5: and there is such a thing....and it can cause a condition known as water intoxication...
TXsscott5: it's so gratifying to be right ;
TXsscott5: ;-)
joefreid: yes, I buy into the law of diminishing returns.  I've heard of water intoxication and I agree with your assessment
joefreid: that doesn't mean you are right
joefreid: though
TXsscott5: why not?
joefreid: my bad...because you found info on Water Intoxification you are right.  I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right
TXsscott5: oh...ha
TXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc.
TXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload"
joefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: thx
TXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know
TXsscott5: now
joefreid: Cow them into submission
TXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime
TXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me
joefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation
joefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere
TXsscott5: ha
TXsscott5: so true
TXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer
joefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?
joefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?
TXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead
joefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?
TXsscott5: that one still gets me
TXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that
TXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne
TXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective
joefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle
joefreid: ?
TXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major
TXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you 
TXsscott5: ;(
TXsscott5: :-(
joefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...
TXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS
joefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.
joefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me
TXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion

Hey Cindy,

I went out to the web-site for the 20K to check my official time and I'm not listed anywhere.  I have a feeling something could have been confused with my number switch, etc.  Do you have any idea who I might contact to get that information?

Thanks,
Susan

hey lis....

i'm sorry i was late last night and not in full party mode, i too was in a bit of a mood.  anyway, was going to see if you wanted anything special for dinner tonight.  i thought maybe i could cook something and that we could do presents etc while watching the ever popular felicity.  let me know how your day is looking and if there is anything i can prepare/pick up tonight that strikes your fancy....i'd be happy to grab berry-hill as well if that would hit the spot.

sue

Happy Birthday again!!!

i can't the weekend of the 10th b/c of a 25K...but maybe the 3rd

I spoke to Katy last night and she mentioned that each of us had expressed interest in going to visit her in Dallas. Right now Southwest has flights to Dallas for $60. Would the 2 of you be interested in taking a trip up there either the weekend of Nov. 3 or Nov. 10?

Let me know because I am going to purchase a ticket for one of those weekends.

Just wanted to say, "thanks gals" for dinner last night.  To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.  Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.  I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.

Sue

hey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.  anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.

.....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.

talk to you later, 
SueBob

good luck w/ the car shopping!!!  i'm anxious to hear what transpires...

as for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.

talk to you soon,
Sue

you beat me to the punch....but that's just because your up and at work
before god.  i know exactly what y0u mean, and is funny, b/c i think we kind
of all sense that kind of thing about each other.  i could tell you were
"off" last night, and felt bad the whole ride home worrying about it.  i
say, let it ride.  sometimes you have to force yourself to buck up (ie, KK)
and sometimes you have to wallow a bit.  the key is finding the healthy
middleground.  takes a while i'm sure, but practice makes perfect.  and it
IS friday.....maybe will pick you up later in dad's (oops!  i mean MY!)NEW
CAR...god knows what it'll be....but 25 yr old can't look an interest-free
gift horse in the mouth.  plus- i would kiss the ground he walked on if it
meant i didn't have to deal w/ car salesmen.  ok- this spoiled brat is off
to do a little "sunroof dance"....if i have the energy, i'll stick if out
for a "leather seats" dance too.....geez!  just kidding!  it's only 10 am!
more later.....

look at you...such a hoax spreader...ha

anyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for Enron, as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.

can't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?

talk to you soon,
Susan

Sorry about the last email...hadn't read this one yet.

The Commission issued an advance NOPR on October 25, 2001, seeking comments on a standard generator interconnection agreement and procedures that would be applicable to all public utilities that own, operate or control transmission facilities under the federal power act.
     

 

I got this a while ago from my dad, but i found it so moving i thought i should share it with all of you.

RE:	[F8] Misc; comradship

Forwarded by several members:

FYI...  This is an e-mail from an Ensign stationed aboard the USS Winston
Churchill...

Dear Dad,

Well, we are still out at sea, with little direction as to what our next
priority is.  The remainder of our port visits, which were to be centered on
max liberty and goodwill to the United Kingdom, has all but been cancelled.
We have spent every day since the attacks going back and forth within
imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, standing high-security watches, and
trying to make the best of our time. It hasn't been that fun I must confess,
and to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the fact that
they either can't be home, or we don't have more direction right now. We
have seen the articles and the photographs, and they are sickening. Being
isolated as we are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is
happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the effects.

About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the bridge to conduct
Ship handling drills. We were about to do a man overboard when we got a call
from the LUTJENS(D185), a German warship that was moored ahead of us on the
pier in Plymouth, England. While in port, the WINSTON S CHURCHILL and the
LUTJENS got together for a sports day/cookout on our fantail, and we made
some pretty good friends.

Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting to pass us close
up on our port side, to say goodbye.  We prepared to render them honors on
the bridge wing, and the Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them
farewell.  As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer announced
through her binoculars that they were flying an American flag.  As they came
even closer, we saw that it was flying at half-mast. The bridge wing was
crowded with people as the Boatswain's Mate blew two whistles- Attention to
Port- the ship came up alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the
German ship were manning the rails, in their dress blues.  They had made up
a sign that was displayed on the side that read "We Stand By You".

Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as they stayed
alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our salutes.  It was probably the
most powerful thing I have seen in my entire life and more than a few of us
fought to retain our composure.  It was a beautiful day outside today. We
are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecured e-mail our location, but
we could not have asked for a finer day at sea.  The German Navy did an
incredible thing for this crew, and it has truly been the highest point in
the days since the attacks.  It's amazing to think that only a half-century
ago things were quite different, and to see the unity that is being
demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us all feel proud to be
out here doing our job.  After the ship pulled away and we prepared to begin
our man overboard drills the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said, "I'm
staying Navy."

I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be home, but for now, this
is probably the best news that I could send you.

TOBIN!!!!!......i was deceased, but i have arisen from the ashes....HOW ARE YOU?

I want to hear all about the UK and how you are fairing there.  If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc.  Sorry you never managed to meet up with emily, but she was actually in the US when you emailed and then only back in London for about a week to pack up and head home.  So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(i.e. UK vs. US for holidays and what not).

If you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.

Susan

BTW:  I'll be in Portland mid-November for work...if you happen to be home then, I'd love to see you...otherwise, any suggestions would be much welcomed.

Are you still alive? What's the word? England is grand, though I am gone so
much I wouldn't really know what's going on here...
Drop a note as you have time. I tried to contact Emily but alas she has not
returned my call, must be quite busy she is!
Let me know if we have a connection.....

Tobes

figured out what it is that grates on me w/ smith.....he is monumentally patronizing to me....and i REALLY don't like being talked down to or made to feel inferior....if i'm not on my guard, my reactions to this behavior run the risk of being swift and strong....

just put it in the outgoing mail....should be good to go...

hope you're feeling better today

Could you do me a favor and interoffice my parking card to Louise Allen for
me?  Thanks.

saturday evening and leave either monday or tuesday...drop me a line
when you get a chance.

susan

Hi Sarah,

So nice to here from you....

I'm actually still employed right now, but don't have a heck of a lot to do around here.  We're all in somewhat of a holding pattern, waiting to see what happens with the bankruptcy etc.  Hope all is well with you!  I haven't made any real decisions regarding my living situation.  My roommate and I have movers coming the weekend before Christmas and as of right now I had just planned on moving back in with the folks...on a temporary basis of course!  Anyway, I'm just not really sure where I'll be 2 or 3 months from now, so I'm obviously reluctant to sign any long term leases etc.  If a temporary roommate is something you guys would be interested in I'd certainly like to discuss the prospect w/ you...but I would also completely understand if you'd prefer to get somebody in there who's more permanent.

My number at work is 713-853-1455 and home is 713-622-2788....

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey Susan,

How are you? I've wanted to catch up with you and see how things are going?
I wanted to find out about your job etc? Also, I am not sure if you decided
on your living situation but if you are looking, one of my roommates is
going to move out at the end of this month and I wanted to see if maybe you
were interested. It is a 3 bedroom cute house on the border of Montrose and
West U. Give me a call when you get a chance or send me your number and I
will call you. 713-522-5881.

Talk soon,
Sarah

once, a long time ago, i think you copied some words of wisdom for me from =
the Importance of Living...if it wasn't you it's not important, because the=
 point is that i recently found them again and reread them today.  i think =
you should read them too, if not for the first time, then again and with fr=
esh eyes....

"the ancient people who desired to have a clear moral harmony in the world =
would first order their national life; those who desired to order their nat=
ional life would first regulate their home life; those who desired to regul=
ate their home life would first cultivate their personal lives; those who d=
esired to cultivate their personal lives would first set their hearts right=
; those who desired to set their hearts right, would first make their wills=
 sincere; those who desired to make their wills sincere would first arrive =
at understanding; understanding comes from the exploration of knowledge of =
things.  when the knowledge of things in gained, then understanding is reac=
hed; when understanding is reached, then the will is sincere; when the will=
 is sincere, then the heart is set right; when the heart is set right, then=

 human affairs.  to know the order of precedence is to have the beginning o=
f wisdom."

right now i think both of us are at the beginning, i.e. "exploration of kno=
wledge of things"...and i think the "things" in this instance refer to thos=
e "things" in the past year which have dumb-founded us each individually.  =
i know you want to get to those heavy and strong top branches (and i think =
to a large extent children and caring for your partner in old age represent=
 those branches for you), but they will not come without the trunk...you ca=

ber that time is the key...and that you can't rush yourself in this process=
.

hope the skiing is great and i will talk to you soon.

SueBob

Disregard the last bit of the previous email...I tracked down a ride.

Phillip,

Here's the power point presentation with updated information.

 

hey sarah,

thanks for the update...i was going to let you know that i'm heading out to=
 my parents tonight to help decorate the Christmas tree, but maybe i can co=
me by one day this week to check out the house.  just let me know what day =
or days would work best for you.

thanks again for thinking of me,

Susan

Hey Everyone,

Just wanted to let you know that my phone number has once again changed. It
is 713-527-0161.

Hope everyone's doing great!

thought you'd find this interesting.....

chrysalis (KRIS-uh-lis) noun, plural chrysalises or chrysalides (kri-SAL-i-deez)

   A pupa of a moth or butterfly, enclosed in a cocoon.

[From Latin chrysallis, from Greek.]

   "The climax of metamorphosis into an adult can be viewed almost daily.
   Butterflies usually emerge from their chrysalises sometime between 9:30
   a.m. and 11:30 a.m."

thought you might find this interesting....

i know some of y'all already have plans, but for the rest of you- is anyone
planning anything fabulous for new year's?  or even not fabulous?
apparently bill will be with his wife, but would actually much prefer to be
with you people anyways.  alan mentioned NB a while back, which could be an
option if there's enough interest.  just hoping will not have to be watching
billy grahm on the christian channel countdown with my grandmother this
year, so would love some feedback....

Julie,

I've been having some difficulty accessing my Hotmail account and therefore have been unable to check for your response to my last email.  If you don't mind, could you resend the response to this email account.  Look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Thank you and Happy New Year,
Susan Scott

Hope you had a good New Year!!!

Talk to you soon,
Susan

 

Hey....my phone's not on at the apt anymore...therefore i'm only checking Hotmail at my folks.

If you want to reach me quicker, i'd recommend the enron address...i should be back to daily access with hotmail shortly.

Hope you had a great New Year!!!!

SueBob

So.....

I'm doing my post New Year's check to see when and if you want another visitor.  As I told you before, I am COMPLETELY flexible in regards to this weekend vs. some other time (and actually, I'm probably more flexible than just the weekend...things are still dead around here).  You just have to tell me yeah or neah.  I feel like you might need to share a good bottle of wine with a good friend and just release.  

Let me know how your schedule is looking and whether you're up to hosting one more visitor to your fair city.

SueBob

Ok my dear....you just tell me when a good time is for me to visit and we'll go from there.  i got your x-mas present last night.  thank you very much, i'm anxious to start reading it.

if you do check email today, give me a shout back.  we can have an old fashioned email chat.  i'm worried about you mo.  i've been praying for you, for all that you're struggling with...but i'm stepping it up double time.  please don't completely retreat inside yourself right now...that doesn't mean you need to talk to me, but talk to someone.

love, 
SueBob

Thanks for the help!

Here you go, with the electric utility...

 

and mo....i don't need to ski, or be active, or be entertained...

if you have some time off and you just want a shoulder...i can be on a plane whenever.   

Hi Julie,

Thanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.

If you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott

Hi Susan-

I sent the note below today to your other email account. Friday, January 11
is a good day for you to visit us.

When I sent the note below, I had forgotten that Jaquelyn Lewis was on
vacation this week. Please send me a reply if you would like our assistance
arranging travel, and I will ask my administrative assistant, Carol Nelson,
to help you.  Alternatively, if you book your own airfare and hotel, we will
reimburse you.

We look forward to seeing you.

- Julie Ryan

Hey Bonnie,

Wanted to wish you a Happy New Year, and let you know that I'm Seattle bound one more time.  I have an office visit on the 11th of January so I should be getting in on the 10th and staying through the 13th.  Hopefully you're going to be in town and able to do something during that time.  Let me know how your schedule is looking.  Can't wait to see you again.  Who knows, this could be the precursor to an actual move...eek!

See ya,
Susan

Hey old married woman....what's up!?

I got your x-mas card...that was too cute.  I hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic New Year.  

I'm also glad you and Matt liked your wedding gift...I absolutely LOVED that pitcher.  I knew I wanted to get that for you the second I saw it, really too cool.  (Didn't hurt that my parents wanted to pitch in on the gift.)  

Anyway, I really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby.  I had a good Christmas w/ family and an EXTREMELY low key New Year - which was definitely ok w/ me.

Hope to see you soon,
Susan

just an fyi...

it's about 4:15 houston time and i'm planning on being at the office for a while (like maybe a couple more hours)...so, if you wanted to track me down i'd try here first.  i'm studying...ha.

I just realized that I hadn't emailed you yet...shame on me.

Em and I (yes, it was just the two of us in NB...oh the shame) tried to call you on New Year's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room and I assume were staying with Priyah (I know I butchered that) whose last name I do not know.  Anyway, I did talk to your Mom the day you arrived in Madras and knew you were there safe and sound w/ a new friend too boot!

Hope you're doing okay and starting to adjust to the new surroundings.  Email me when you get a chance and let me know all about your trip.

Good Luck and talk to you soon,
Sue

I'm kind of between places right now, so it's probably best to just send things to my parents house

10802 Jaycreek
Houston, TX 77070

and I would suggest trying to reach me via my cell phone:  713-775-6472

i guess i'll see you at the next tasters!!!

Susan and Bate,

Please send me your current addresses.  I am sending out an invite for a
shower for Caycie on Feb 2nd.

Thanks,
Lisa

Also send me your home numbers so that I can update my organizer.

forgot to tell you....

talked to Jennifer Bagwell yesterday and...she and Christian got engaged on the 28th.  she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy.  just thought i'd fill you in some good news.  and, yes, i do think it's a good thing.

also, i'm sure tori sent you an email...but, yesterday was her last day w/ ENE.  i'm truly thrilled for her too.  i think this is going to be a very good thing.  

hasta

this quote just fell out of one of my spirals....

"The timid and fearful first failures dismay, but the stout heart stays trying by night and by day.  He values his failures as lessons that teach the one way to get to the goal he would reach."

								--- Edgar A. Guest

Ok...my capitalization skills in that last email were horrible...I was checking it before I realized the next click would actually send the message...my apologies.

Any interest in going to the Rockets game tonight.  I have free tickets and it may be Hakeem's last game.  Let me know.

Sue

Hey Lisa...good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  I assume you didn't get the other email I sent.  No biggie.  Just wrote to say Em and I tried to call NY's Eve, but you had already checked out of your room.  I guess you were staying with Priyah (sp?) at that point.  

Talk to you soon!!!!
Sue

y'alls were the only email addresses i could remember right off the
top of my head. currently, i cant access the internet to get to all of
my email addresses on hotmail. i will write a longer message later
when i know each of you has received this. so email me at this
address now and then choose which ever going forward.

hope all is well.
lisa 

so obviously i decided against coming up this weekend...ha.  on the one hand i thought it be nice to hang out today and have a little distraction before your apt., but then i thought it might be better for you to have the day to reflect, prep, etc.  anyways, just wanted to see how you're doing and since you do have the day off i figured you'd be popping into the cafe at some point.

got an email from Lisa...so she is at the school and sounded ok.  it was a short mass email.  hope to getter a longer one at a later date.  

talk to you soon,
SueBob

i'm a total dork....before my last trip to seattle i sent away for the visitor bureau's tourist packet...

anyway, i was looking through it this weekend and it turns out i actually have a coupon for the symphony.  nothing big, something like 10% off, but i'd just thought i'd let you know.

hope you had a great weekend and i'll talk to you soon,
Susan

btw...i also have coupons for the IMAX and some other attractions.

hey there chickie....

it's about 3:00 Houston time and i'm bored out of my mind at the office...no big shock.  i'll be impressed if i make it to 3:30...

so, i was just going to let you know that i'm probably bolting out of here relatively soon.  however, i've found a restaurant that has a little section w/ 2 computers and a couch that i make go crab a cup of coffee at later.  my point being that if you email me back today i probably will have a chance to check it.  

if i don't chat w/ you today, i'm sure we'll touch base at some point tomorrow.  and, on that note i hope things go well tomorrow morning.

talk to you later,
SueBob

hey i'm back at the office now....and if you're going to be back at 3:00 my time i'll just stick around.  glad to here things went well.  i'm running to the loo, i'll be back in a few minutes if you're still there...

Well, this morning was a little anticlimatic.  We did not get started till
935 bc she her house had flooded this morning and had to make some phone
calls to get things under control.  I was able at least to get the ball
rolling...however I did not get into my huge screwup.  I just started with
what I am feeling now..and why I am here in Utah...a little family
stuff...but no relationship/personal stuff.  She of course asked about
medication and I said I did not want to go that route unless I became so
blah that I couldn't leave the house or go to work...told her..I wasn't
there.  So I told her about my change in diet, no caffeine, no alcohol.  She
thought those were great things.  She advised me to attack this cold...ie:
get rid of it soon..and immediately resume exercise....aerobic exercise in
particular.  She said that it is aerobic, not the anaerobic (weights,yoga)
that are most effective for the funk.  So I bought some echinacea extract
and some echinacicia/zinc lozenges and today i'm gonna continue rest (will
nap this afternoon)...and I should hopefully be good to get a nice snowshoe
hike in the morning before I work tomorrow.

So thats it.  We have an apt on next tues.  I hope to get into everything
else at that point...there was so little time today.  She said DV pays for 8
appointments...so that made me happy.  I think 8 should make a good dent in
things and if I have to fork out a little cash after that point..it should
be worth it.

I'll be back at the cafe at 4 to work.  I'll check email later.  Hope you
are doing well.

Hasta

ok....i'm back at the desk.  just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight...cool.  

as for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.  next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.

i was reading a bunch of my "With God All Things are Possible" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced Jesus' reaction to a sinner who approached him.

"he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself. (bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well)

like i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.  

good luck kick'n the cold.

SueBob

PS - if you need a non-drinking partner at the "annual party" i'm in....

hey mo....how's it going?

hope you had a good day at work today, mine was boring as usual.  just wanted to let you know that i thought i might try to give you a call tonight and fill you in on my plans for seattle.  i really feel like i have no idea how this whole thing will pan out, and i'm getting more nervous as friday approaches.  oh well, c'est la vie right?

i've been trying to freshen up on things and be a little more on top of my game...but it's tough.

i've agreed to be out of my apt. by the end of the day Monday...saves me about $250, but then the commute starts...yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!

talk to you later,
Susan

hey...

i actually just filled my change of address form out this morning...i figured you'd already done yours.  i'm leaving for the airport straight from work tonight and don't get back until sunday night.  i can fill it out monday, but if you would like it done before then you may want to try and tap someone else for the job.

the reason monday is important is b/c someone wants to rent our place and i've told the complex that i'll be completely out by the end of the day monday.  so starting monday night i'm back in northwest houston and w/out a mail key.  on the bright side, i'm getting a fair amount of money back from the january rent (which means we're cool rent wise, i.e. you needn't give me any $ for january).  

i do have an interview in seattle tomorrow morning...i'm nervous and excited.  i've been studying a bunch for the last week and a half or so to try and prep myself.  i think i'm more nervous about not liking the job rather that liking it or not doing well in the interview.  also, i'm going to see "kiss me kate" the musical w/ my friend up there so that should be fun.

i'm glad to hear that things seem to be going so well for you there, you sound awfully busy.  keep us posted on all your many activities.  

Sue

-- i knew you were going to take like a fish to water w/ this thing.....never should've worried so much.

Sue,

this is an inconvenience but just realized that i never filled out a
change of address for our apartment. if you get a chance could you
please fill one out for me. i would ask my mom but it has to come
from our post office off of W. Alabama.

8218 Devonwood
Houston, TX 77070

Thanks,
Lisa

Heard you have an interview in Seattle this weekend. Good luck
and let me know how it goes.

Hi Julie, 

I just wanted to touch base with you one last time before I arrive in Seattle and make sure that I have the correct time and location for our meeting.  As we discussed, I intend to arrive at your offices at 9:00 am Friday morning.  To reconfirm, you are located on the 15th floor of the One Bellevue Center Building (411 108th Avenue N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004).

I will be staying in downtown Seattle Thursday night and will have my cell phone if you need to reach me for any reason - (713) 775-6472. 

I look forward to meeting and talking with you tomorrow.

Susan

Sounds good to me.

Tori Kuykendall

hope everyone is okay with this -- i talked to the people that were here and we all agreed.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the birthdays simple.  

<Embedded StdOleLink>

Hey Holly,

Just wanted to let you know that I'll be back in Seattle this weekend (tonight - Sunday morn).  Not sure what you're up to, but if our schedules allow it'd be nice to see you again and hang out.  I'm staying at the Claremont downtown and will have my cell phone w/ me (713) 775-6472.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey Holly,

I wanted to thank you for including Bonnie and myself Saturday night...we both had a great time.  It actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w/ almost total strangers, makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting.  You have a nice group of friends, and I will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live, etc. should I end up moving.  Hopefully I will know some more in a week or so...and when I do I will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

we need to chat....didn't know about the other cafe!!!!

that's awesome.  can't wait to hear more.

I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or play outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny...he tipped me .50 on 2.50..ha.  The town is loaded with intense
looking film types with their dark rimmed glasses...north face down jackets,
cell phones and ski caps...its pretty funny.  This morning I went for a jog
around down town....I walked down Main st. on my way back and there are all
these people getting photographed along the street...you look at them and
try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like any other guy.
The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out their stories and
photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in this cafe and all are
being used right now..it is crazy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe

hey mojo...

sry about the missed call last night...had put my cell on silent mode for dinner and forgot to take it off.  hope you had a good night.  i really want to talk to you about the last week or so, sounds as if was an eventful one for both of us.  i'm really curious to hear how your appointment went today so drop me a line if you get a chance today and we can set up a firm time to have a rap session.

hasta,
SueBob

Julie,

I just wanted to write and thank you again for affording me the opportunity to visit with you and all the other members of the  Puget trading team.  It was unfortunate we were unable to meet again before my departure so that I could have expressed the above in person, but email will have to suffice.  I very much enjoyed meeting with John, Mark, Dana and yourself, as well as with the other members of the gas and power staff.  You have a unique operation and one which appears to have many untapped opportunities that will undoubtedly make your time with the company fairly interesting for the foreseeable future.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and look forward to speaking with you again in the future.

I went ahead and mailed all of my travel information, including receipts, to Jaquelyn Lewis as see was mentioned as the travel contact in one of your previous emails.  If there are any other measures I need to take on that front please let me know.

My previous difficulties with my other email service have been resolved.  Therefore, all of my future contact will most likely be through that email address.  In light of this, I simply ask that you direct any future email correspondence to: 

susan_m_scott@hotmail.com 

Once again thank you,
Susan Scott

IT'S BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  MONTH & TAG YOU'RE IT! 

[IMAGE]
Well, it is and that  means you and me. I'm supposed to send this to
[IMAGE]
FIVE BEAUTIFUL  WOMEN, and you are one of them!!! 
Facts on Figures; 
There are 3  billion women who don't look like supermodels and 
only eight who do.  
Marilyn Monroe wore a size 14.[IMAGE]
If Barbie was a real woman, she'd have to walk on all fours due 
to  her proportions. 
The average woman weighs 144 lb. and wears between a  12-14. 
One out of every four college aged women has an eating!  disorder.
[IMAGE]
The models in the  magazines are airbrushed -- not perfect! 
A psychological study in 1995  found that three minutes spent 
looking at a fashion magazine caused 70% of  women to feel depressed, 
guilty, and shameful.   
Models  twenty years ago weighed 8% less than the average woman.
[IMAGE]
Today they weigh 23%  less.
[IMAGE]
~Beauty of a Woman~  
The beauty  of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, 
The  figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. 
The  beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes, 
Because that  is the doorway to her heart, 
The place where love resides.  
The beauty of a woman Is not in a facial mole,  
But true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.  
It is the caring that she lovingly gives,  
The passion that she shows. 
The beauty  of a woman 
With passing years -- only  grows.
[IMAGE]
An English professor  wrote the words, "Woman without her man is nothing," on the blackboard and  directed the students to punctuate it correctly. 
The men wrote: "Woman,  without her man, is nothing." 
The women wrote: "Woman! Without her, man is  nothing." 
The Images of Mother 
4 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mommy can  do anything! 
8 YEARS OF AGE ~ My Mom knows a lot! A whole  lot!
[IMAGE]
12 YEARS OF AGE ~ My  Mother doesn't really know quite everything. 
14 YEARS  OF AGE ~ Naturally, Mother doesn't know that, either. 
16  YEARS OF AGE ~ Mother? She's hopelessly old-fashioned. 
18  YEARS OF AGE ~ That old woman? She's way out of date! 
25  YEARS OF AGE ~ Well, she might know a little bit about it.  
35 YEARS OF AGE ~ Before we decide, let's get Mom's opinion.  
45 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wonder what Mom would have thought about  it? 
65 YEARS OF AGE ~ Wish I could talk it over with Mom.  
***Please send this to at least  five phenomenal women today in 
celebration of Women's History Month. 
If  you do, something good will happen.... YOU will boost another 
woman's  self-esteem!

don't have much to pass along....i've been looking into some places to stay if i come up.  i may run a few of the names by you to see what you think or if you know anything about them.  

i've got to get out of my house SOON!!!  mom woke me up this morning to see if i "needed to get up and start getting ready"....she'd heard my alarm go off and evidently didn't realize my extensive use of the snooze button.  she then followed me out to the car to give me directions on how to drive to work (i.e. which lanes to use...ha)  even though i'd made it just fine the day before.  on the plus side, my meals are being made for me and there is always cheese and crackers.

talk to you soon,
SueBob

Do you think we could me for a few minutes this morning?  I've got a couple quick questions...I didn't feel like bugging you over the weekend.  Sometime before 10 am would be best for me because at 10:00 I'm supposed to attend a meeting regarding the analyst/associate program as it relates to UBS.

Thanks

Karen,
 
A meeting on this subject would be beneficial to many making decisions today.  Please let me know when and where the meeting will be held if it is in fact organized.
 
Thank you,

A 10:00 am meeting has be tentatively scheduled for you Tuesday, location to be confirmed, to discuss the Analyst & Associate Program as it relates to UBS.

Hi Julie,

Sorry to be a pest of late.  I was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning.  There are some deadlines I am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later.  If you could let me know if there is a time before 10:00 PST that would be a good time to talk I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Julie,

I've been given a bit of a reprieve on the deadline.  So, if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful.

Thanks,
Susan

Hi John,

I've been trying to get a hold of Julie this morning, but am not certain if she is in the office today.  My current situation has become somewhat interesting over the last several days and I was hoping to be able to talk over some things with her.  If Julie is in fact out of the office today would you mind if we talked at some point.  I'm under some deadlines around here and would be very grateful to have an opportunity to discuss things with Julie or yourself.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas tr=
ading.

Thanks

Mike,

I see in your emails below that you are indicating that the allocation proc=
ess does not comply with the tariff. The allocation process I do not think =
is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =
only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=
ff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=
he range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =
way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation=
 process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it=
 looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=
e found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=
W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=
tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract=
 deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=
llocation process itself.

Thanks Ramona
Regarding my meeting invitation..............I hope this helps.

I've had a series of e-mails with Marketing, Legal and Regulatory regarding=
 TW PNR in an effort to finalize the process and procedures. As a result, I=
've learned that TW's allocation process does not comply with the tariff. (=
See below) Marketing wants to continue with current practices, but changes =
are required for the allocation process.=20

Mike,

I recommend that we continue to use the current practices we are using now =
of charging the PNR rate posted on the day service begins.  I also recommen=
d that we continue our current practice of  using the nomination process an=
d posted rates for PNR service.   In the future, we may choose to change th=
ose practices to one of the methods you recommended below.  It is helpful t=
o know that that would require system changes and new language on the posti=
ngs to accommodate any new change of that sort. =20

Thanks for your help on this.

Sue

Sue & Kevin,

I need some help from you..............
Based on the response from Susan Scott and Glen Hass (below),=20

Should TW continue the practice of charging the PNR rate posted on the day =
service begins or charge the rate posted daily? (Using the latter, TW's pos=
ted rates would include the text Susan provides below)
 =20
Should TW continue to use the nomination process and posted rates for PNR s=
ervice or revert back to entering into individual purchase orders for each =
deal?
The individual purchase orders are not as convenient , but they provide bet=
ter clarity between the parties.

TW's allocation program uses the posted and/or deal rates entered into CBS =
when capacity is allocated. It  does not calculate ..."the greatest total c=
ost commitment". System modifications are needed to determine which shipper=
 has the greatest cost commitment.  =20

 =20
You asked:

=091.  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta=
ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should=
 TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?

=09Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.=
  Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi=
th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understa=
nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s=
ame day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con=
tract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice =
and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at =
a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoi=
nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-=
mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says=
 the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document=
ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.

=09Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers =
the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot=
her shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no dis=
crepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of dis=
crimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea=
sible from a business standpoint. =20

=09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, =
here are my recommendations:

=09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be =
something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B=
E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks =
awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)

=09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible=
 to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No=
. ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate=
 posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be ju=
st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo=
uld not have to be done for each deal.

2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo=
r a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c=
an only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets prior=
ity?

=09Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota=
l cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.

hey holly,

just wanted to see what's going on with you, and to inquire how the long weekend in whistler went...i'm curious to hear how everything played out.  also, bonnie wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in tacoma and went to west point.

drop me a line when you get a chance.

Susan

I will be staying at the office later than I initially anticipated this evening.  If either of you are able to talk simply let me know the time and I will give you a call.

Thank you,

Hey...

so i've given everyone the heads up around here regarding my decision, and surprisingly enough they have been on the whole very supportive.  Frank told me this was a "good thing" for me and that he was jealous.  And Steve actually said he was proud of me.  anyway, it's gone much better than i had expected.  still don't know exactly what happens to me now.  so we shall see what the next weeks hold in store.  

i'm still checking into lodging etc. for this weekend/early next week.  i can fly in saturday or sunday, but maybe sunday morning would be best.  i figure we could touch base and plan the next couple days (plus, i wouldn't have kept you up all night chatting saturday night so that you're exhausted for work sunday).  then we'd have all day monday and tuesday and i'd probably fly back on wednesday....just a thought, feel free to share you own.

drop me a line when you get a chance,
SueBob....finally living up the name!

well girls,

i didn't end up getting the job with Puget.  i was runner up to a guy with more trading experience.  he hadn't decided whether or not he was going to accept, which is why they were waiting to get back to me.  i called last night due to the decisions i was having to make around here and the VP i met with there subsequently called the guy to get an answer.  unfortunately for me, his answer was, "yes".  

anyway, while that opportunity is no longer...i have still decided to decline my offer with UBS to join the reformed trading organization down here.  on that front, i am still very interested in trying to get up to seattle and was wondering if either of you were familiar with some headhunters.  let me know if there are any things in particular you think i should be looking into.

thanks guys,
susan

hey courtney,

i'm sorry i didn't reply back to you sooner, but i'm sure you'll understand when i say that things with work have been a bit on the crazy side.  i'd like to attend tonight, but have a bit of a scheduling conflict.  i was wondering if it would be alright if i showed up between 7:30-8:00 rather than at 7:00.  also, where exactly are the festivities going to be held?

thanks,
susan

wow, huh?

anyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them rig=

 future holds for me when i have a better idea. =20

more importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.  not only for=

you obviously have on the people with whom you work.  it's often hard to se=

 life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.  i tried to ima=

but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be sma=

cheers!

hey lisa....

what's the scoop with tasters tonight....time and location?

i think i'll try to come, even if it's just for a quick drink with the gang.

see you soon,
susan

This whole experience must be too much fun for you...getting to work with a=
ll these young pilots (any of them single?) and strutting your stuff. =20

The trip to Park City was fantastic.  We had some really good meals and man=
aged two solid days of skiing.  It dumped 2 feet of snow Sunday night so we=
 had tons of powder on Monday to ski through...and to cushion our falls.  T=
uesday was absolutely beautiful, sunny but still below freezing.  The views=
 from a few of the runs at the top of the mountain were breath-taking.  Mon=
ique took all the pictures on her digital camera, so as soon as she uploads=
 them I'll be able to check them out and order a few.  This is my first day=
 back at work this week and it looks as though they're moving me to another=
 floor pretty soon...too much sensitive information up here I suppose.  It'=
s fine though because there are a few others from the trading group who dec=
lined the UBS offer and will be housed on the other floor as well, so I wil=
l have company.  I've got a couple other leads to try and track on the job =
front...another company in Seattle and one in Richmond, VA that my old trad=
er Larry told me about.  I'm still glad I made the decision I did and am ex=
cited to see where that choice ultimately leads me.  Even Tobin (from my fi=
rst group here at Enron) is trying to help my find something in the Pacific=
 Northwest.  I'm really curious to see what he may come up with since his a=
cquaintances run the gamut in terms of interests and occupations. =20

Glad to hear you're having a good time and helping out in the "effort", and=
 I'll talk to you soon.

Love,=20
Subaru

Suz, I'm using both addresses since I don't know which one is current.
Guess that you had a good time at Monique's and did a little skiing.  Hope
that work is going as well as it can under the circumstances.  We are
flying and having a good time out here.  It's fun to work with the Navy
again.  This time it is the carrier  Abraham Lincoln and her battle group.
 mostly we make attacks on her and fighters like F-14s and F-18's come up
and intercept us.  We are carrying electronic pods which jam and deceive
their radars and everybody gets some good training.  Yesterday I just got
out to the area which is south of San Clemente island off the coast of
Southern California and had a generator failure.  I was with another A-4
and he continued the mission.  I went back to Pt.Mugu and jumped into
another airplane and got back out for the second and third runs.  The whole
thing just about wore me out but it felt good to get the mission
accomplished.  Love, Dad

I bolt out of here pretty early these days if I can...best to reach me by cell phone if it's past 4 pm Houston time (713-775-6472).  Did I tell you I'm off to Vegas this weekend?  I love this job.

Sue

   

you are utterly unreachable.  have tried to call 3 times and am stopped in
my tracks by some secretary type who takes 5 mins to tell me you are not at
your desk.  what up?  try to call me later tonight- have "appointment" with
jen at 9 pm my time, so preferably before 9 or after 10 pm....peace out.

Pattie,

I am definitely still interested in the position and will give you a call today between 11:00 and 11:30 PST.

Thanks,
Susan

Susan - -   We are very interested in you as a candidate for our Gas Mnagement Rep position and would like for you to come to Seattle as soon as possible for a second interview - - assuming you are still interested.  I am available by phone this morning between 9:00 and 9:30 and again between 11:00 and 11:30 PST.  Please call me at (206)381-6829. Thanks!

I recently had the following wine at Wahso in Park City, Utah - USA...
991211200 Zilliken 1999 Saarburger Rausch Sp?tlese 17 750ml 
I was wondering if you could tell me of a distributor or retailer from whom the wine might be purchased.  I currently reside in Houston, TX but will be making a trip to Seattle, WA in the next couple weeks.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

Hey Tobin....

I just wanted to make sure you got the last email I sent you....in response to your email below.  If it's just taking some time to respond no worries, if you didn't receive it for some reason let me know ( I attempted to answer the various questions posed ).

Cheers,
Susan

You are absolutely the BEST Tobin...

I think I'm flying back up to Seattle next weekend to have a second-round interview with Cascade.  However, I must admit I'm intrigued by you and your father's very diverse connections in that area of the country.  Hope you are doing well and that Merry Old England is treating you properly.  

No rush on getting back to me, I just wanted to make sure you received the email and had whatever answers I had to give.

BTW....I'm celebrating my first quarter century today!  Quite a milestone in one's life.  I have to love that I'm essentially unemployed and living with my parents.  Big pat on the back for that one. Ha.

Ciao,
Susan

Question:  Do you think you will return to the PNW when you finish with school...we hadn't really talked about your future plans and my curiosity is peaked.

Susan:
I have your email! Sorry I have not responded. Alas, you are not forgotten
however. I called my dad and a few others and they have promised to get back
to me shortly. I will write more thoroughly tomorrow. Hope you are well....
Best,
Tobin

No worries....We can chat tonight.  I wanted to talk to you about President's Day weekend anyway, and I need to do some research on that front today.  Thanks for thinking of me though (if it makes you feel any better, I forgot it was my birthday yesterday morning until Mom gave me my present).

Susan

Susan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Chuck that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Chuck started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed
you last night!

Sorry I missed your call last night...big shock, I was in the bath-tub.  Anyways, you can definitely give me a call tonight if you'd like.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Emily,

Hey Bonnie,

Ok, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey Lisa,

Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.

Thanks,
Sue

hey...

thanks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.

as for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.

if all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!

hope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  

talk to you soon,
Sue

btw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.

	Hey sue,

just wanted to wish you a Happy 25th birthday!! I know its a day
late. I can't believe its already Feb. 1. Wish I were there to
celebrate with you. Did you or are you doing anything exciting?
Please send me an email and let me know whats up regarding the
job opportunity in Seattle and Enron as well???!!

Lisa

Hi Suzanne,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.  They last time I came to Seattle I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.  http://www.seattlesupersaver.com In the past, I've stayed at both the Westin and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.  I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.  You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.  My work number is 713-853-1455.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

Hey Chris,

I was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in Thursday evening or Friday morning.  Honestly, either option would work for me I just wasn't sure if Chuck would want to sleep in Friday morning since it's his day off.  Let me know which one sounds better to you.

Susan

Susan,

Sorry we didn't call last night.  I thought about your
birthday the night before and reminded Chuck that we
HAD to call you on Thursday.  Chuck started Air
Assault School yesterday, and that's turned everything
upside down.  We'll call you tonight.  Sorry we missed

hey holly,

just wanted to let you know that i'll be in seattle again this weekend.  i'm coming up for a second interview with cascade natural gas.  i fly in thursday evening and leave monday, so if you're in town we'll have to get together some night.  hope all is well and i'll talk to you soon.

susan

hey lisa,

i looked in my car and couldn't find your dress, so i'm pretty sure you took it inside your parent's house saturday night...where you put it once inside i have absolutely no idea.  good luck tracking it down and thanks again for letting me stay at your folks, i really slept like a log on that bed.

susan

Hey Courtney,

I just wanted to make sure you got my membership check last week.  If you didn't, or if there's anything else I need to do, please let me know.

Thanks,
Susan

Mom must be at it again....

career meter:
You find out late this week that your suspicions were right on. You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions. It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.

love meter:
You feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts. It's liberating knowing where you stand.
weekly horoscope:
For February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct. This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer. The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice. Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is. Don't be afraid. For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give. Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears. As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest. 
Thought you might enjoy.....
 

jees....

sounds like loads of fun at the hillegeist household.  i'll give you a buzz later.  buck-up little camper...only 7ish months to go until sweet escape.

sue

ok, so i never gave you your b-day gift....as though there wasn't enough
time on friday....it IS very exciting, and know you've been on pins and
needles....let me know when you want it.  will prob be mia for a few days
soon- visit nans and gramps, plus major down swing in dad- first mr. brown's
death yesterday, then this morn, he had a needle puncture him thru his
gloves, and the guy has hepititis (plus- is "very feminine and unmarried at
age 33!!!"- ie, he's GOT to be gay, and w/ AIDS, so now dad KNOWS he's dying
of AIDS, and blood tests cannot be sure til 4 weeks later.....am ready for
another fabulous, upbeat month!)  tata...

Suzanne,

The flights sound great timing-wise and I know exactly where that hotel is located...being within walking distance of Pike's Market is always a bonus.  I look forward to the visit as well as the opportunity to finally meet everyone I've spoken with in person.

Thanks again,
Susan Scott

Hi Susan -
Feb 7 Thursday - your air reservations are on Continental Flight 367 - coach Lv. Houston/Intcon 2:35 p.m. nonstop, ar. Seattle 5:17 p.m.

February 11 - Continental #423 coach nonstop. lv. Seattle 11:50 a.m., ar. Houston/Intcon 5:57 p.m.

I will not be mailing you tickets.  You will be using Record Locater VT8YST.

I made hotel reservations for you (see attached).  This hotel is between Cascade Natural Gas and downtown Seattle.  Because there are 4 conventions in Seattle this weekend and the annual Northwest Garden &
Flower Show, hotel accommodations were slim.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Have a great day.

Susan

Actually, I flew out to San Diego Thursday night.  It was incredible...I cannot believe that there are places where the weather, scenery and people are that beautiful.  Seriously, I think I could find a lot of guys to be interested in there.  Strapping, physically fit beach boys with awesome dogs and a decent amount of world travel behind them.  

Hope you had a good Easter Weekend and that school isn't getting too stressful.  I'm guessing you're coming up on some serious exam time in the near future.  

I'm off to Vegas this weekend, but I was debating the prospect of Austin the weekend of the 28th.  Let me know if you're going to be around/able to socialize (even if only briefly) that weekend.  I really want to come up to see Kathy and Travis's new house...I feel bad they've been in it for over a month and I haven't even seen it yet.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

   

I liked that-- and I deinitely agree!  I have done about half of those
things...  Not too bad for a spoiled brat.

Are you leaving for San Diego tomorrow?  I am coming in town tomorrow, but I
bet I am going to miss you.

Hey Mr. Noble,

Quick question, are you in H-town this week or hanging out on the west coast?

Susan

Ok...The flight option I've selected on Continental arrives at 5:17 pm Thursday and departs at 12:58 on Monday.  I haven't actually purchased the ticket yet, so if you want to get back to me to suggest anything else for some reason please don't hesitate.  However, if I haven't heard from you in the next hour or so I'll probably assume that the times are okay and just go ahead with the purchase.

Susan

I may take you up on that voucher...I'll touch base with you tomorrow at some point.

Hi Susan - I have a Hertz rental car voucher if you need it.  Later - Susan

I don't know if this will get to you, but I'm on the fourth floor right now...I may stop by to see if you're there.

Was wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening.  Also, if Janie would like one she's more than welcome to join.

you tell me...you're the one that is actually working these days.

Would you mind mentioning it to Janie as well...I'd hate to not offer?

I would love a ride. What time

Was wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening.  Also, if Janie would like one she's more than welcome to join.

that's fine...i can meet you by the elevators for the parking garage

how about 4:30 Janie is out at 4:00

You'd probably better tell me what day works for you....you're the one with the family.  I'll give you a call as soon as I can find a phone down here.

Sounds great, let me know which day, give me a call, something else I want to speak with you about.

Hi Larry,

Just wanted to see how you're doing these days.  I'm glad to hear things are finally up and running and that you all have stuff to do now.  I'm with the rest of the lepers down on the fourth floor these days.  We'll have to round up a group to grab a drink after work sometime.

Susan

yes...the email address is susan_m_scott@hotmail.com

do you have msn mess service

Susan

Yes, I'm back from SD and appropriately depressed to return to hot, muggy Houston.  Glad to hear your trip was so enjoyable...and no worries about the pina colodas, you gotta do what you gotta do ( I was drinking rum punches in the Caymans like they were water...much scarier than pina colodas I assure you).  The weather, scenery and people in SD were gorgeous.  I really think I'm supposed to be in Del Mar.  There are the most attractive, active, worldly men swarming the beaches with even cuter dogs.  I spent a large part of the weekend with my tongue hanging out.  It forced me to the realization that the men in Houston, and much of Texas, are soft.  Alas, no exciting stories though...

Let me know how the movie is, I may have to make a special trip to see this one...All of the Kappas who've read the book insist I should write my own version filled with Susan's tails of woe.  There is definitely ample material.

Sorry to hear about Ben and the girlfriend.  I'm sure your parents will be sad to see his calming influence go.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

   

hey- guess you're bk from SD- hope it was fun.  am guessing the weather was
fab, and you had a chance to eat drink and be merry. the cananries were grt-
75 degrees, breezy and not a cloud in the sky.  was reading the avg rainfal
per yr is approx 13 days, so i guess the odds were in our favor.  poured my
lumpy white body into a bikini, much to the dismay of anyone on the beach
with healthy vision, and drank dos equis, pina coladas (am not proud, but
they WERE good!)  and copious amts of pringles and bags of mini snickers and
kit kats.  heaven on earth.  back to reality today- sigh.  no class til next
mon, but major grp assignment due then, so will be working on that all week.
  today:  research and seeing bridget jones diary in afternoon (bank holiday
here).  pretty lame easter.  church by myself- avg age in congregation:104,
approx 20 people.  london completely empies out for easter since mon and fri
are bank holidays. kind of their spring brk.  called the fam at gogo's to
say happy easter.  not pretty.  all the grandchildren were absent for the
first time this yr- jeremy and new wife in austin, cousin christi and hubby
in dallas, ben at home "suicidal"  according to mom b/c megan dumped him.
which is REEEALLY bad news- in fact, he came bk from her house post break up
w/ a broken ankle or something...mom thinks from a fight he may have got
into w/ a guy at megan's.....oh, the drama of it all.  either way, am pissed
b/c he left my poor father to lift and carry and "transport" my VERY heavy
deadweight Pa Pa bk and forth from the nursing home by himself, and my GoGo
and nans and gramps were almost paralyzed w/ grief b/c thee was not ONE
youngster there.  little creep.  well, am off to the library-  try to chat
tonight-

where are you these days?

what are you needing, i have the points that are needing to be reconstucted.  Not all of them will need to be, just the ones with positions.  PWC is currently making files for each point to be stored in.  So we may need to touch base before starting.  let me know.

Hello Pete,

Let me know if this is the correct email address.  I was hoping to pick your brain a bit.

Thanks,
Susan Scott

Hi Pete,

Would you mind shooting me back an email to let me know if I have the right address.  Brad McKay had actually given me your new work number, but unfortunately you were off the desk when I tried to call a few minutes ago.  Not too long after you departed, I too ultimately chose to decline joining UBS and am currently in the midst of researching new opportunities, interviewing, etc.  On that front, I was hoping to pick your brain a bit about a few things.  

Thanks,
Susan

Hi Chris,

I just wanted to follow up with you and see if you had a chance to look over my resume.  I realize I may not be exactly the candidate you had in mind when you first spoke with Larry, but I would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss any opportunities you may have available at this point.  As Larry can attest to, I've had responsibilities at Enron that span from back office to trading.  To that extent, I believe I could prove to be a valuable asset within any organization.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

No LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though.

This is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?

Thanks Kathy...

Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.  Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.  Chance Rabon has said he will do some research and I've contacted some of the traders from the West Desk who were in charge of collecting that information.

FYI - Below are procedures for populating the curve validation templates.  All templates have now been loaded with curve information and are now ready for the broker quotes.  Could you please also keep me informed of where you stand in the process of completing these.

Thanks, 

Kathy Kelly

All,

Attached is the preliminary draft of the Natural Gas procedures for Trader actions in populating the template.

Kathy, I'm getting this to you as a heads-up.  There are specific actions the traders need to take in order to populate the templates accurately.  Please share this info. with them; they shouldn't wait on us for the final copy.

 << File: Curve Validation memo - Trader procedures.doc >> 

Did you happen to save any of the written copies of the quotes?

Hey Tobin,

Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.

Susan

Could you shoot me an email when you get a chance...I was hoping to ask you a few questions about the west curves that Keith Holst was in charge of collecting.

Thanks,
Susan

Keith....could you make this request?

Susan,

I don't know if this will help, but if Keith could ask Roberto if this can be retrieved, perhaps he'll have better luck than I did yesterday.

Thanks,

Kathy

Ed,

To recover email, the person will need to submit a request to Roberto DeLeon in IT Security.  It will probably require the approval of that persons supervisor, Phillip Allen in this case.  I believe the access will be temporary, and it may be monitored.

Keith should be able to work through this process directly with Roberto.

Thanks, d.n.

Dave/John, 
Would you guys please see the attached note below related to email mailbox contents being "destroyed" and not recoverable.  Please contact Kathy Kelly to discuss.  I want to make sure that we can not recover before we give up.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

Ed, I wanted to give you a quick update on where things stand with regards to the curve validation project.

Project Progress:

John McKay and Sandra Brawner have completed validating the curves for the east.  PWC has a programmer who is working with Brad and me to see if he can upload the quotes from the electronic quotes we received as well as the reshaped curves that John and Sandra have prepared.

Joe and Troy have just about completed entering the quotes for Permian, Ship Channel, and Waha for the Texas desk.  However, they still need to shape and validate the curves.  

Denver and Kevin have begun working on entering the quotes for the central desk.

On the west we ran into a problem with retrieving the quotes.  Apparently Keith Holst had all the quotes electronically in his email.  However, when the Netco people were converting over to UBS, Enron's IT people destroyed all email that was sitting in the inboxes of these employees.  I've already checked with IT and they have assured me that there is no way to recover that data.  Susan has been working with Keith to see if he had sent any of these emails to others or saved them on his hard drive and thus, she has been able to recover at least part of the days.  Currently, we have quotes for Dec. 12 - 21 and Dec. 31 - Jan. 8.  All other days we are still missing data on.  This process took most of today and Susan will begin working on the quotes that she currently has tomorrow.  

Personnel Issues:

John Arnold was suppose to be back in the office today.  When he did not show, another call was put into him today.  I have not heard back on the status, but will check in the morning.

Both Russell Murrell and Martin Cuilla are suppose to be in tomorrow.

Khymberly has assured me that there isn't much likelihood of Jim Schwieger coming in at all.

Karen Scott needs to take this Friday off.  She had already booked a flight and was to have a long weekend with family.

Kevin Ruscitti will be taking off all of next week.  He and his wife had booked a trip to Mexico some time ago and he feels that this may be the only vacation he gets this year.  He has assured me that he will be here the rest of this week and the last week of February to help in whatever way he can.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathy

Hey Bonnie,

I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.

I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.

I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,
Susan

Btw...that cute place on 4th Ave in Queen Anne was already rented.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.

have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?

happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)

Take care
bonnie

hey...how's it going?

sorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.  btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.

as for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.

i'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.

talk to you soon,
susan

the pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.

Sue,

whats up on the job front?
Got a delivery failed message when i tried to send this to you the
first time. somehow it went to susan.m.sc@kis.ernet.in???

i am sorry to hear about purget, but it sounds like things may work
out for the best regardless. i am so excited for you and very
excited to visit you in seattle when i return. i must say that you did
a very bold thing turning down UBS without having  another job
lined up. but i agree with you, its definitely best to make a clean
break. are all the employees that agreed to stay with UBS going to
 relocate or stay in houston? did lenhart accept? how long did you
have to make your decision? are you still working at enron for the
moment? if so, how long can you stay on and still receive a
paycheck?  what does your mom think about seattle? i cant
believe you could be there by march. sorry for all the questions...
just excited to hear.

yvette and erik have accepted jobs at Huber and are staying in
houston, but signed the contract to sell there house before they
accepted the job. so they will be moving into an apartment.
anything else going on? keep me posted and send me your hotmail
 email address. i have it in my address book on hotmail but havent
been able to access the internet in a week. just want to be able to
find you if you leave enron soon.

talk to you soon, take a look at the pictures below on my first week
 in kodai.

lisa

Marion,

I apologize for not returning your call last night.  I was out to dinner when you rang and by the time I returned home it seemed too late to call back.  You should be able to reach me today without any problems.  If you would like, you could also just shoot me an email with a time you would prefer to talk and I could phone you.

Thanks,
Susan

Call Ambrosia ? Monday morning

Bonnie....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.  

So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  

Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Btw...messengered with Matt yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.

hi there:
how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?

Question for you....

which section of Queen Anne did we think seemed better?  Was is the North streets or the West?  And which side of Queen Anne Ave would i want to be on....I can't remember any of this stuff.

Thanks!

Hi Pattie,

I just wanted to make sure that you had a chance to speak with Justin Fernandez.  I thought of him when you mentioned possible candidates for the other open position as he was with our scheduling group and is, I believe, from that area of the country.  If you haven't had the opportunity to establish contact with him please let me know and I will be sure to get each of you the other's contact information.  Hope all is going well with you and I'll talk to you soon.

Thanks,
Susan

Hey,

The trip to Nashville was good...Chuck and Chris actually live in Clarksville (which is about 45 mins NW of Nashville).  We went out to dinner in Nashville both Friday and Saturday night, and spent the day walking around downtown on Saturday.  Chuck drove me around the Army base and showed me a bit of the area where they live.  We also went to this Botanical Garden/Museum called Cheekwood...it's the estate of the Maxwell Coffee fortune.  Anyway, it was fun and very relaxing.  They're house is really cute and their neighborhood requires at least a 1/3 an acre for each house...so there's lots of land.

I haven't made a decision about the Seattle job yet, I actually have until the end of next week to give them my answer.  In the meantime I've been talking to some headhunters and checking out any other options that may be out there.  At this point there is really no telling where in the U.S. I'm ultimately going to end up...which I personally find kind of fun.

We got a total of $350 out of the $400 deposit back (not too bad).  I just deposited the check so all I need to do is drop off a check for $175 to your Mom...which I will do this weekend.

Hope things are still going well there!

Keep me posted,
Sue

hey sue,

just wanted to check in on you. how was your trip to tennessee?
have you made any decisions regarding the job in seattle?

shoot me an email when you get a chance.

talk to you soon,
lisa

by the way, did you get anything back on our $400 deposit?

Here's the new and improved updated version...

 

Charles,

I don't believe I received the form you referred to during our phone conversation.  If there is something you would like me to fill out, please feel free to forward it to this address.

Thanks,
Susan

thanks.

Actually...I the first available appointment on Sat is 2:00 pm (right in the thick of beach time!!).  I ended up making my reservation yesterday for 11:00 am tomorrow, I might be able to switch it to 10:00 though b/c they still had it open yesterday.  However, the 11:00 may work out perfectly.    That way when my treatment's done at 12:30 we could just start our day from there - lunch, shopping, etc.  What do you think?  I'm sure I can find some way to occupy myself for a couple of hours on Sat...no worries.

   

hey susan-

any chance you could get into the spa around 10:00 on saturday?  i'm sure that's a popular time, just wanted to see if that was a slot they'd had available....my study group wants to meet at 10 on saturday, and i'm planning to go for just 2 hours, so it would work great if you could do the spa thing then.  if not, then the beach is right across the street from the library where we'll be meeting so i could always join you there after my study session.....it's sprinkling right now but is supposed to clear up tomorrow and be sunny this weekend ( i hope!!). 

i cannot wait to have a weekend to relax- it has been so crazy here! 

i'll see you tonight!!worst case scenario (contingent upon weather and traffic) i'll pick you up at continental curbside baggage claim.....travel safely!

julie

hey julie,

sorry i've been MIA of late.  i want to play catch-up with you, but i'm afraid i'd wear myself out typing.  i was wondering if there was a good time for me to call (either during the day or after-work).  let me know.

hope all is going well.

susan

btw - i was wondering if anyone is throwing you a bridesmaid's luncheon the weekend of your wedding?

Thanks Sarah.  That was very touching.  I just forwarded it to a bunch of people...too good not to share.  Hope you have a happy Easter!!!

Love,
Sue

Hey Paul...

If you're on the computer could you log into AOL.  I don't have a phone near me to call you on, we need to go over these curves.

Francis Lim 
Jeremy Wong
Nilay Basu

These individuals may now be with UBS, but they should know who to contact on the estate side.

It's a very mixed web of information and people...it may take a while, but someone knows where all this information lies.  Ganapathy is a great information source.

Susan,

I contacted Jeremy and Nilay. They did not think that the gas curve relationship data was contained in ERMS, but they referred to me Ganapathy Ramesh who is familiar with RiskTrack. I am waiting for him to return my call.

Sincerely,

For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like

really would. I hope you learn humility by being
humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being

the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody
gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It
will be good if at least one time you can see puppies
born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a
black eye fighting for something you believe in, I
hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line
down the middle of the room, but when he wants to
crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and
your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll
let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can
do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two
blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone
as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope
your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying
one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you
also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope
you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your
mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you
hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen
flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I
hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch
with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May
you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the
holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you
throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and
that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These
things I wish for you through tough times and
disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its
the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of
your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our
friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.

Looks like this visit to Seattle is going to be a quick trip this time.  I fly in Sunday (yes, this Sunday) and fly back out after my interview on Monday.  Maybe we could grab dinner Sunday night...that is if you're free of course.  We could even see what Holly's up to.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Thank you Jacquelyn...I look forward to the trip.

Susan,  Please let me know you received this.

Hey Lisa....

I'm probably going to have to head out this evening.  I'll call you on your cell phone to let you know if I'll be able to make dinner or not.  Can't wait to see you guys.

Susan

Hi guys!

I have been incredibly disorganized about the rsvps for Caycie's party this
weekend - so if you have already sent it in, I am so sorry!

Please email me back and let me know if you will be there for the Friday
night dinner (8:00 - Wimberly) and if you want to get a manicure/peticure
on Saturday.

Thanks!

Love,
Lisa

Hey Holly,

Just wanted to let you know that I'm flying in Sunday evening for an interview on Monday.  Bonnie and I are talking about going out to dinner, nothing big, and were wondering if you might have any interest.  Let me know your thoughts and if I don't here back from you via email I'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend.  Hope things are going well.

Susan

Sorry Mo....certainly didn't mean to bum you out.  I'm a torrent of mixed f=
eelings today.  Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with som=
e of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.  I was also in =
the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was =
bringing back stuff too.  I'm just struggling with this pattern of attachin=
g myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotio=
nally not available.  and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very c=
onflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...b=
ut i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is so=
mething wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), w=
hich ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten.  so anyway...i think i jus=
t want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy=
,a location, a massage...whatever.  i'm just very disappointed with mediocr=
ity.  i feel luke warm about too many things. =20

and the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely m=
ade me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have m=
aybe kept things from going too far. =20

give me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better a=
fter a little nourishment.

So i was kind bummed after talkin to ya on IM.  I'm at DV now..about to
start work.  You know...we have both made a lot of progress.  I'm glad we
have been there for each other thru all of this.  Maybe I'm bummed that whe=
n
I made the comment you immediately thought the worst...not that you see us
going back to where we were..but that it brought things back so quickly and
that perhaps you could see you or me reverting back to old ways.  And that
part of my life still feels like a fresh wound. I realize that I am still
struggling with things..and while I respect that I have come far...I know I
still have to make good choices on a daily basis with my life and live with
integrity.  Coming back to H will be very interesting for me...I can only
hope for the best and that the experience of being away and having time to
think has made a difference for me.
Take care, I know you are sick and out of sorts today. HOpe you feel better=

Mo.

Craig,

In an effort to make sure that I am adequately prepared for my interview, I wanted to touch base with you and confirm that I possess all the necessary information and forms.  Last week I received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information.  Also, I have confirmed my flights, hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with Sharon Roberts.  I assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession, if you know of any additional information I may need please let me know.  The last area of interest I am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule.  If it is possible at this point in time, I would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom I will be meeting.  If the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request.  I look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow.

Thank you,
Susan Scott

i will see you there....i'll have my cell

ok girls...sue, haven't called you bk yet w/ the 411, and kates, haven't
heard back from you after i left the past couple messages, so this could end
up being a collosal disaster, but went ahead and made reservations at Garson
for 7:45 tonight.  it's on hillcroft btwn westheimer and 59...super scary
area on "wrong" side of westeimer, but have reliable sources who've raved,
and since was close to Hart, have driven past several times and looked safe,
  persian food, which is i'm not exactly sure what.....but supposed to have
good meze, kebabs, and persian ice cream.  hope y'all are in.  could be
supremely embarrsaing to dine solo in semi-formal middle eastern restaurant
w/ no bar....luby's or cafe express is one thing....a belly dancer's haunt
is quite another!  chat soon, mes amis...

Kevin,

Thank you again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  After speaking with everyone Thursday it became obvious to me that there are some real opportunities and room for growth with Cinergy right now.  It was also apparent that it is going to take a good deal of hard work and the ability to tackle many variant tasks to achieve those aims.  To that end, let me reiterate to you my willingness to take on a host of responsibilities to aid in that process.  As I expressed to you at lunch, my goal is to obtain the skills and tools that will make me a consistent and effective trader.  I left the offices Thursday with the impression that Cinergy, and those with whom I interviewed, could help me to accomplish those objectives.  Good luck with the many tasks ahead and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thank you,
Susan

Craig,

Just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.  I know your schedule has been busy of late, but I very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding Cinergy and the Cincinnati area.  The types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities.  Good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thanks,
Susan

DeShonda,

I had some difficulty replying to the parking & transportation email and just wanted to make sure that you received my request for a space in the new parking garage.

Thanks,
Susan M. Scott

Hi Herb,

Tim Bowler had actually given me your name and email address a little while back and thought it would be a good idea for me to drop you a line.  I have been working with Tim for a couple weeks at Enron and, upon learning that I was in the midst of job hunting, he suggested I contact you.  For the last year I served as an assistant trader on the West Natural Gas Desk (Wholesale).  For various reasons I chose to decline an offer in February with the newly formed UBSW Energy and am currently still working for Enron.  I'm attaching a copy of my resume to give you a better idea of my background and experience.  If you know of any opportunities that seem like possible "good fits" I would very much appreciate hearing about them.

 

Thank you,
Susan Scott

Hi Joe,

Just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I received my offer information from Jeff Rogers.  Since we didn't have a chance to meet and talk when I was in Kansas City last week, I was hoping at some point we might be able to discuss the responsibilities you envision for me within your group.    Please let me know when would be a good time for us to speak.

Thanks,

Thanks, But No Thanks: Turning Down the Offer

In today's job market, it seems ludicrous to talk about turning down a job offer. Everyone should be so lucky as to even get an offer. But you need to stop and think before you jump out of desperation into a situation that is not good for you. Even though it may be uncomfortable, there are times when you have to say, "Thanks, but no thanks."
Great News; You've Got an Offer
George was laid off from his job in June. After four months of rejection, he finally got an offer. He was excited. Or was he?
It really wasn't the job he wanted. It was just one of the jobs he had applied for, because he was qualified and could perform the duties. The job really didn't match any of his values. Taking this job meant a long commute in heavy traffic. Financially, it was going to be a lateral move. But, most of all it was not a challenging or growth-related opportunity. The thought of going to this job day after day depressed him before he even accepted.
How could he turn down an offer after so many months of waiting? He was dreading telling his wife about the offer for fear she would think he was crazy for not taking it. How could he tell the company he didn't want the job after going through all those interviews?
Do What You Want
The company wanted to know by the end of the week. George was making himself sick thinking about the decision. That afternoon, he happened to catch a television show about taking care of yourself in stressful times. "Do what you want to do, not what others want you to do," was the message. George knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to continue looking for a better opportunity.
When he told his wife, not only was she understanding, but she was encouraging as well. "Life is too short to make decisions that are going to make you miserable," she told George. The decision was made. George would turn down the offer. Together they wrote a script to gracefully reject it.
Making the Call
The next morning George placed a call to the hiring manager. "I've thought over the offer extended and have made a career decision not to accept the position," he told the manager. "I am grateful to you for believing in me, and I hope there may be an opportunity for us to do business in some way in the future." The hiring manager was disappointed but said he understood career decisions and the need to do what's in one's best interest.
It takes courage and maturity to reject a job you really don't want. The best way to handle difficult decisions is to weigh the consequences and decide what is best for you. Since you don't want to alienate a business contact in the process, it is best to be as professional about the conversation as you can. Preparing a script ahead of time will assist you with your discomfort. No one likes confronting unpleasant situations, but one difficult moment compared to weeks, months or even years of work you find unpleasant is a small price to pay.

hello?

Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.  Be sure to tell everyone I say, "Hello!"  As for the zoo, I am a huge fan.  It's the only zoo I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.  It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.  Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

You'll have a great time! It's a fun city. Make sure you go to the zoo for
at least a few hours. It's the greatest!

Have fun,

Hey Lis....

As always it's good to hear from you.  I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).

I have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  

Part of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  Chris went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes Chuck and Chris told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly Elizabeth Scott.  My Mom and Chris's Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  Chris is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.

I miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

how's it going?

just thought i would check in and see how you were?  you were
right, my mom said i did received the $1100, pre-tax, so actually
$700. oh well, at this point money is money. priya just found out
she was accepted to SAIS at Johns Hopkins so she has been
frantically looking on the internet for jobs for me in DC. it is one of
the places that I am interested in relocating to but am also looking
in boston and northern california as well. have you heard anything
from the KC, Cincinnati, or Chicago jobs?

hope all is well. i miss you all tons. oh, starting to finalize travel
plans for the summer and it looks like niclas and i are going to be
meeting in Europe somewhere for about 5-7 days. he's mentioned
skiing in the swiss alps and italy? i am sure i wont be lucky
enough for it to work out, but we will see. talk to you soon,
lisa

Hi Jose,

I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days, and more importantly where you are?  I'm still at Enron right now working for the "estate".  I've been interviewing and have a few offers, but am not completely sure what I will be doing.  Hope all is well with you and I'd love to hear what is going on in your life.

I promise I'm not trying to rub it in....actually, I was just going to do the spa thing to give you study time but if you don't need it (and you'd rather go shopping, etc.) let me know and I will forget about it.  I must admit though that an hour long massage sounds wonderful.

Sue

   

hey susan-

you are so demanding with your spa schedule!  : )  are you rubbing it in, or what??   friday sounds better, because saturday we have  bunch of tentative plans....i'm also not as stressed about the studying factor because i took monday as a vacation day to study, but please do go ahead- the spa treatment sounds wonderful!  so anytime friday works great for me....

Caycie,

I just left a message for you at work...How EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe both you and Jen got engaged on the same weekend.  I'm absolutely thrilled for you and look forward to all the fun festivities this will warrant.  You know I think Briggs is great (I've had so much fun hanging out with him at all of these weddings) and you're obviously pretty fond of him so I can't imagine a better bit of news than that of your engagement.  I can't wait to hear all about the event (and see the ring - I'm sure it's gorgeous).

I think I'm actually going to try and come up to Austin the weekend of the 12th...from what I understand Jessica will still be in town, as will Corey, and Jen had expressed some interest in making a road trip so we'll see.

Love,
Sue

PS - Are you coming in for Deborah's wedding?

   

Susan-
I hope that all is well.  you might have already heard by now, but Briggs
and I are ENGAGED!!!!  It happened Friday!  I didn't know how to reach you
so I would your e-mail on one of Lisa's e-mails.  I hope that all is well.
Let me know when you will be in Austin next.
Talk to you soon!

FERC Order Issued 3/28/01 Rejecting SPP/Entergy's RTO 

	The Commissioners were generally displeased by SPP and Entergy's lack of substantive work toward complying with the Commission's previous orders and failure to sufficiently discuss the feasibility of a broader RTO.  As Chair Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission's order in May and taken it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).

?	The Commission declined to approve SPP's scope and configuration because the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.

	o	Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)
	o	Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer control of transmission to SPP.
	o	MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion, will be met.

?	Approves Entergy's proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting rights to the Transco and approves Entergy's Board approval process (states that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee's seven members). 

?	Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation by joining SPP instead of MISO.

?	The Commission did not address EPMI's motion to condition market based rate authority on RTO participation.******

Ditto

   

On March 28, FERC provisionally approved the GridFlorida RTO.

Some positive aspects for EPMI:

States that EPMI's proposal for a real time energy market has "theoretical merit", but practically may not be implemented when operational.  Encourages consideration of our proposal and how it could be practically implemented.
Grants EPMI's protest that Applicants cannot acquire software and other systems implementing market design until after the independent Board is seated and given its approval.

 

I believe this was intended for the other Susan Scott...I'm with Nat Gas Trading. 

Thanks

   

I talked with Rogers, who said that it makes sense for us to advocate one RTO from Entergy through Southern into GridSouth (presumably getting TVA to commit at some point to an RTO).  Florida should probably be separate.  SPP could be in this RTO or the Midwest.  Therefore, the overall theme that Jim discussed this morning (that FERC has started something somewhat positive, but should take the step to actually state that it wants these utilities to work toward one SE RTO) can be put into the GridSouth and Southern request for rehearing (Tom C. is getting the draft of this.)  Thanks.

Hey Kasey,

I just got an email back from KJ and he seemed to think you're going to be in San Diego until Saturday or Sunday of this week...so, I thought I'd drop you a line and let you know I too will be in San Diego.  I arrive Thursday evening and don't leave again until Sunday afternoon.  If you have any free time give me a call on my cell phone, 713-775-6472, and we can try to get together.  I've got your number from your last visit to Houston so don't be suprised if you hear from me.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00, 10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I'm looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I'm looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)

Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or 
a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light 
misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. 
Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.

Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.

Time: 90 minutes

Pacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - 
are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You'll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute 
message that completes the treatment.

Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.

Time: 90 minutes

I'm checking out the L'Auberge website as we speak...it sounds wonderful.  =
As for baseball, I'd love to stop by for a few innings on Saturday.  It sou=
nds like fun and I wouldn't mind checking out the stadium.  I can't stress =
enough how flexible I am on all this stuff.  We can wait a while before dec=
iding which is our best beach day bet.  I'll check out the spa's schedule r=
egarding massages to see what kind of flexibility there is there.  As for t=
he clothing I will try to remind myself SD is casual...Houston's gotten pre=
tty sassy over the last couple of years.  I always feel underdressed when I=
 go out here.  Thursday night sounds great...two days and counting.

  =20

great ideas and suggestions!  i'll respond in more detail later, but wanted=
 to let you know you picked some of the best restaurants in san diego!  i'l=
l try to gather some people to go straight out on thursday evening- that wo=
uld be fun....i was going to study on saturday, but may have to rethink tha=
t if you've found saturday to be better beach weather.  i do like your plan=
 for friday...i've asked my rooomate for spa suggestions....the one i do kn=
ow of is L'Auberge resort in del mar- you can probably find info on the web=
 and/or call them (don't have the phone number handy, unfortunately!).  i d=
efinitely think a jacket is better than a sweater- unfortunately it's quite=
 cold today.  does usually warm up during the day, though.   do you like ba=
seball?  i might be responsible for hosting our skybox on saturday, so we c=
ould drop by for a few innings, but if not, then i can get someone else to =
be in charge.....i am taking monday off of work to study all day, so it sho=
uld make me much more relaxed this weekend. and i'm going to study like cra=
zy tonight. =20

there are several churches near me, so we'll probably go in del mar, cardif=
f-by-the-sea, or encinitas.....still working that out. but definitely plan =
on a run on the beach (if that appeals to you!)- i've been so horrible abou=
t working out these past several weeks. =20

since san diego is pretty casual, you should be able to bring a pair of bla=
ck pants or a skirt or something and have it function for both dinner out a=
nd church.....and of course, i always have sweaters and jackets, so you can=
 always borrow something of mine. =20

i'll drop you more info once i have it!

love,
julie

situations, I was wondering what you suggest I bring along.  For instance,

the morning and then I could go for the massage while you study.)
Supposedly, it's going to be warmer on Saturday than Friday so maybe we
should plan Saturday as our beach day...of course, I'm completely flexible.
As for brunch on Sunday, I did a little research yesterday and came up with
a few suggestions... George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa,
Trattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.  All of these, with the exception of
Pacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into
consideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an
option (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement
both religiously and gastronomically).  All of the places mentioned above,
in addition to The Fish Market, Cafe Japengo and En Fuego Cantina & Grill,
also sounded good for just regular meals.  Depending on local culture (and
your own opinion) I was just going to let you know that I can go straight
from the airport somewhere if you want on Thursday.  I didn't know what
time people typically go out to eat or if you even wanted to go out
Thursday night.

I know, I know...I had way too much time on my hands yesterday.

In the end, I'll really do anything and go anywhere...just thought I'd help

Just heard from the Earl...he said he's okay but has just been really busy the last few weeks.  I encourage you to drop him another line sometime in the near future and suggest lunch, as he seems receptive to interaction at this point.  

As for last Wednesday, we had actually moved on to Steak Night by 9:30 and then were off to Sierra's.  Needless to say it was a big night.  

Glad to hear the game was good and I'm not suprised in the least that you have "get-up-and-go" (I've seen you when an attractive woman passes by).

I'm a no go for Thursday as I've actually already made dinner plans with a friend.  Besides, Dean's is the ex's favorite Thursday night hang-out for the reason you mentioned and for that same reason it sadly is not mine.  I'm sure after this response Ben will be convinced I'm avoiding him, but I assure you that is not the case.

Cheers

I should be in town this weekend if anything is going on...

   

Oh I am so glad to hear from you! How are things? Been thinking about you---no not in that way. :)
No, actually, Daniel and I got back around 9:30 and I went into Farrago's to see if you were there....but you weren't. I looked like death warmed over after the game...it has been way too long since my playing days. To be true, I have the get-up-and-go, but I literally whiffed a few kicks...
Thankfully, Daniel played well. He had one pitch that was sweet!!
What are you up to this week? I am trying to get Ben to go with me to Dean's on Thursday. I love that place on Thursdays....wait, I digress...I like the ladies on Thursdays there. Want to go?
Let me know what the Earl says...I am a little disappointed in him as of late...not that he cares.....

Walle (that's Latin for "good day")

What happened to you last Wednesday?  Were you too pooped after you soccer game for a cold brew?  Hope you had a good weekend anyway and that things are in general are going well. 

 I just dropped the Earl a line to see if he's still breathing.  I'll let you know if I hear anything back.

Caio

<Embedded StdOleLink>

Thanks for thinking of me (the ride back was lovely - lots of gummy food items and carbonated beverages)...i'm very tired from all of the weekend activity though and don't see much rest in my future.  Oh well life is short, right?  

I'm so glad we were able to spend some time together this weekend, and that you got a chance to meet my parents.  I'm going to have to make a trip up to Austin soon for a visit to make sure you're hitting all the must sees/eats.  By the way, how long are you going to be there?

Susan

Maybe I'll hit an "Eaters" outing.

   

Please respond to <mharp@austin.apc.slb.com>
Well, that clarified it...

How are you doing?  I hope that you and Jen had a safe trip back to Houston.
I thought of you this morning when the Uncle Kracker song popped up on
sonicnet.  Song is "Follow Me" and the album is Double Wide.  Classy,
classy.

Have a great week and hope to catch up soon!

Thanks for the info...I will check into it.  Hope you manage to get some rest.  The wedding was fun, super sweet and huge (800+ at the reception).  I got hit on by a waiter at the rehearsal dinner and groped in the hotel elevator by one of the groomsmen...so I'm up on guys right now.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue

   

just got this response.  have not read it, but after what has felt like the
longest day of my life, am not sure i can still read.  go ahead and analyze
and act as necessary.  will chat when i come bk out of coma.  goodnite.

Sounds good...I failed to comment on your movie question.  No, I haven't seen any lately so that sounds good to me too.  I've been going crazy on the internet today looking for things/places to do/go.  Anyway, I was also remembering how wonderful getting that massage was last time I was there and wondered if you knew of a good spa close by your place that maybe we could both go to ( or I could go to while you're studying).  Just a thought.

   

no, i don't really.....do you have ideas??  we have a couple options:  there is an easter service in some flower fields that are just beautiful and have an ocean view- if it's nice, it might be a unique place to go for a service.  otherwise, there's always my parent's church, but that's rather far so i've already set them up for us not joining them.  there is another church in my area which a bunch of friends go to, but to which i've never been.....i'll send out the email and find out where everyone is going this weekend.....let me know if you've heard of good brunch places!

I'm flying Continental and I will check my mailbox for the card...I haven't checked it in a while.  I'm going to bring my pictures from the last two weekends ( very fun activities...I tell you all about them this weekend).

Love ya,
Susan

   

great- sounds perfect!  have you seen any movies lately?  i haven't seen a movie in forever and there are several girl movies out that i would love to see....chocolat among them.- i've heard the scenery is amazing.  what airline are you flying?  i'll be there thursday at 7, and will check the arrival time before leaving work.  i will be picking you up directly from work, but always have my cell phone on me, should you need to get in touch:  619-890-7565.  

yeah!!! thursday will be here before we know it!!

have a great week.....oh- i have several rainy day activities, should the weather be less than stellar. did you ever get the card i mailed you at work?

can't wait to see you!

Hi yourself,

I swear you read my mind sometimes...I was just about to email you.
Anyway, things here are good and I am equally (if not more) excited about
my visit.  I know the weather's been kind of funky the last week or so but
I've been hearing the same rumours as you regarding a weekend warm-up.
Therefore, I'm still bringing my suit/beach clothes and will just make sure
I've got some stuff in case it stays on the chilly side.  I'll also make
sure to include some work-out clothes and Sunday attire ( I'm assuming 
skirt or dress will work okay? ).

No worries about the need to study.  I've been go-go-go the last couple of
weekends and would not mind at all having some down-time during the day for
naps, lounging, walking, etc. while you study to your hearts content.
Honestly, we've got plenty of time to do things so it's no big  deal.

My flight is supposed to arrive Thursday night at 7:00 and I leave at 3:40
Sunday afternoon ( I got direct flights this time so I won't be nearly as
tired).

Hope this week isn't too crazy for you...of course, if it is you'll be more
than ready for a little R&R.

Love,
Susan

                                                      
                                                      
                                                      

hi susan-

how are you??  things are super crazy here, so wanted to drop you a note
before it's suddenly thursday!  i am SO excited for your visit and a day
off- i do have to warn you that my statistics mid-term got postponed
(horrible and a relief at the same time) until the monday after easter, so
i may have to study a bit over the weekend....i'll of course try to get it
all done before you get in on thursday, though!  don't want to intrude on
our beach time!

the weather is odd right now- raining and chilly, but they're claiming it
will warm up to 68 by friday- hopefully warmer.....so still definitely
bring your suit, running shoes, and church clothes for Easter.....

what are your flight times?

can't wait to see you!
love,
julie

Hi Ashley,

It's so funny that you emailed me today because I was just telling Jessica this weekend that I needed to drop you a line.  Unfortunately, I'm no longer moving to London.  I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.  However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.  I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.

Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.  I will be in town basically the 6th through the 11th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).  I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.  Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together. 

Talk to you soon,
Susan

   

Susan,

I know this is a bit random, but I know that you had maybe mentioned coming
over to London for a year.  I have no idea if this will pan out, but I am
looking for a roommate.  If you were comign over and might want to be my
roommate, I would be super excited.  I live in a really cool area in teh
middle of everything and do not want to have to give up the flat.  It is
actually really cheap rent at ?200 a week or so.  the little man who owns
it lives next door and keeps different flowers planted depending on the
season.

If you are not coming, or just do not want to be my roommate, do  you think
you could keep your ears open for anyone you know who might be moving over.
Do you think your friend who you were visiting might need a roommate?

Think on it and let me know any feedback.
Take care,
Ashley

Hey buddy,

Out of curiosity, what all are you bringing with you to San Antonio?  I'm running into some problems in the area of cocktail dresses as I developed some noticeable tan lines from my trip.  Oh well, I guess they're not that big a deal right?  

Also, do you just want to swing by my complex Friday morning to pick me up?  I promise not to run too late.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

We know about Merle...don't know if I'll be able to go though b/c I have to be in San Antonio at a bridal luncheon by 12:30 on Friday.  There's no reserved seating anyway so I think I might be a bit of a mess (remember how crowded the Bellamy Brothers were?)

As for the trip over...I'm arriving on the 6th ( Wednesday morning at 7:45) and I'll be leaving the morning of the 12th.  Not perfect, but if something looks appealing on the mid-week trip front let me know.  I'll have a total of 6 full days over there.  Plenty of time to do something interesting right?

Sue

I'm not going to tell Lisa for a little while, so mum's the word....hopefully she'll already have booked her own flight.

   

did you girls know merle haggard was going to be at tine hall on thurs. the
5th?! can't believe it!  hope y'all are planning on going....

Sunil,

I promise I have not forgotten about you.  Things around here have just been crazy with the beginning of the month and all.  I should have some time tomorrow to get together if you like, just give me a call.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hey stranger,

Haven't talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  

Anyway, I've decided I'm a no go for Austin this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, Lisa's wedding this weekend and San Diego next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and Doug Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and Doug.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hope Law Review isn't wearing you too thin.

Actually, I'm thrilled you want to drive.  I know I like to drive most of the time, but I'm not kidding about being exhausted and thus wanting to limit my exertion.  I think we should shoot for leaving by 8:00 so that if we're running a few minutes late it's no big deal (as long as we're on the road by 8:30 we should be fine).  I have no idea what I'm wearing yet either...oh well, necessity is the mother of invention, right?  

The trip was incredible.  My life has done an absolute about face.  Can't wait to tell you all about it.

Talk to you later, 
Susan

   

Yeah!!!  If you don't mind, I would love to drive... Matt is flying in and
I'm not sure if he'll need a car but I wanted to have mine available to him
if he did need it.... is that alright?

THANK YOU... BIG for making maps... that will be wonderful!

The luncheon is at 12:30 and how long does it take to get to S.A.?  Should
we leave by 8:00 or 8:30????  I don't even know what I'm wearing yet.....
ughhhh!

I can't wait to hear about your trip... how was it?

Talk to you soon friend!

Love,

Jen

Lexi,

I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.

Thanks,
Susan

Okay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in Austin, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San Antonio.  Absolutely no more getting lost for Susan...zapps my energy.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Yes, I am going home before the reception and am going to have Katy meet me at the apartment around 6:15 (at least that's what time I'm telling her).  If you want to tell Laura to meet at the apartment around that time too, I will be there to greet her.  I'm going to drop off some dry cleaning, finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there.  I'm so glad everyone is up for this outing...we are so culturally aware.  

So that's the plan.  I suggest we eat somewhere around the Museum District...I'll do some research this afternoon.

Talk to you later,
Sue

Here you go....Katy wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the "reception" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.  Let me know if that works for you.

Hey, make sure you don't migrate your old last name over to UBS.  You are coming up out of Egypt and need your Freeland name.   

**For New UBS employees***

I am going to send all of our File Migration compliance forms in one batch, so give them to me when you have signed the Document Migration Certificate. I will be sending this the evening of the 8th.

If you don't know who I am or what this is about, ask Dave Steiner or any of the Admins.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland

Would it help if I faxed you the 'you will have your card in 2 weeks' note they just gave me?

Good Morning,

I am going into a meeting at nine for I am not sure how long, so just leave a message if you have a problem or a question.  The loss schedule is per Crandall.

Cara

   

Hi,

I am sitting here at my desk talking contracts and energy, and in my
head I am thinking about kisses, caresses, and waking up with you. 
You make me feel so special, and beautiful, and cherished. I would
really like to play hooky all during your shutdown and just be with you.

I want to have a completely lazy day, just vegging, reading, snacking,
keeping my feet warm, petting cats, watching movies, and snuggling by my
fireplace. How does Christmas Eve sound? Do you have plans?

Bye my special one,

Kitten

I the undersigned, hereby accept the intended offering of the parties in the first part to provide "food" and "beer", with the following provisions:

1. The sponsors of the feast, Christian Yoder and Steve Hall, must attend the function in person and engage in conversation and laughter.
2. Gratitude from the attendees must be accepted at any and all times.

Thanks Guys! I look forward to scarfing a little pizza and brew with you!

Cara (soon to be Freeland)

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter "we" or "our" or "us" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal ("Lunch") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage ("Beer") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve      

Hi Sweetie,
 
I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.
 
I have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.
 
Talk to you later, have a good long weekend off. I have a new cell phone number 810-1105
 
Cara

Thanks Frank,

Hey did that intermittent blank drop down field bug in the physical path area get fixed?

I tried doing a tag a few days ago and still got that error.

Have a good day,

Hi There,

What a great e-mail!  I got a warm glow and a great laugh all rolled into one.  I am keeping that one in my palm pilot so I can read it anywhere I want.

I woke up thinking about you, took my bubble bath and looked at my pink toenails thinking about you, put on my lotion thinking about you, drove to work singing along with the radio to Steely Dan thinking about you, and am just about useless at my desk thinking about you.

I really enjoyed just vegging last night.  You have a good day too cutie pie.

;)

Everything is wonderful......................just wonderful..............................there is a suprise on the way for you today from me.
 
Craig is so nice, we had a really good weekend. Thanks for inviting me to your drunken bash!

About another hour or so and I am outta here. I am tired..........ti..............yerd.

Y'all have a good day.

Should we go ahead and separate our names on the credit cards?  I think it would be wise.

Also, If you want to transfer Pahio to our joint account that is fine,  I would like to have Pahio.

When you come up, if you want to come to work here and get the car and give me the truck keys, we can do that.  Just let me know.

Thanks,

C

Everyone keeps asking my why I am grinning today. I thought I was playing it pretty straight.............................................

It's all good.  

Dear Mom,

I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.

I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. 

Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?

Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.

503/810-1105

Love,

C

My boss just said "It's all good".  I laughed my ass off

Hey , is there any way on the face of the earth that I can get ahold of one of the remaining Drexler basketballs?

Cool!  No problem.  We plan to buy something nice (like your bath goody idea) for each of the mothers', so this works!
You're awesome!

I threw the tree tag away, but I gave Lynn a bunch of bath goodies in the handle bag.

Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Happy Holidays!

----The Enron Elves Team----

I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.

Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.

I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.

I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.

I had to put all my OATI files in a secure non-UBS place, but it is 600 per month for up to 15 users, and 100 a month flat fee for faxing.

They are going to raise the rate to 750 per month to pay for the e-tag 1.7 upgrades.

My contact at OATI is Frank.Billington@oatiinc.com

or  kevin.burns@oatiinc.com

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,

Can you please provide the latest contract terms we have with OATI for the West.  I would think that we too could reduce our # of users and Tags being printed every month.

Thanks for your assistance - MO

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.
Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you. [May, Tom]

Please see the attached spreadsheet,   

I have added leg 2 to both annuities in red.  I looked at the spreadsheet that Diana forwarded me, and probably need for you and I to sit down and just walk me thru it.

Cara

Hi Mom,

I am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!

How is Natalie doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for Monty and Jackie and the whole family.

Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.

I love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.

Cara

Hi Sweeties!

You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?

Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.

I love you and hope you all are well.

Cara

I haven't heard any firm plans, but I am game for nearly anywhere  maybe Perry can scare some folks up?

What's going on this weekend? Are folks hitting the town?

My dancing shoes are ON!
 
Woohoo!
 
 
Wanna go play before then?  If you could use a little company, I would be game for something fun to do!

Dear Little Sister,

Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.

I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.

I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.

I love you,

Cara

Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?

"Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was," Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. "This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal."

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it "didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity."

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.

"You could come up with an idea and get people excited," said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.

"You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover," she added. 

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

"When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative," Mr. Rigney said. "When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb."

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.

"I just got here five months ago," said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. "I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight."

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.

"It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon," said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. "They created a kill-and-eat culture."

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. "People tried to take work away from you," he said. "There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects."

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. "There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently," said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. "I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief."

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.

"They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska," one former Enron employee said. "We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked."

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.

"I don't think Enron will ever be recreated," Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. "Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early."

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.

"Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts," wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. "By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative."

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.

"I really hope the company turns around," she wrote. "But I know it will never be the same."

Cara,
Sounds great.

See you tomorrow at 9am!

Thank you,

John Oh
Let's meet tomorrow morning about 9 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses.  I expect it will take about 15 minutes.

Thanks,

Cara

she said she would get it for me after this conference call.  Are there going to be more Enron layoffs?

I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Amy

I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

Let's meet tomorrow morning about 9 am to let me show you all of the tools that scheduling uses.  I expect it will take about 15 minutes.

Thanks,

Cara

Good Morning,

Due to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.  They have a wide range of experience and abilities, and would be available to assist you in whatever tasks may need handling.

Please let me know if you have temporary room for any one or all 3 of these folks, I would like them to have something to do while we are waiting for trading to resume.

Thanks,

Cara

Hi,

Yesterday Richter asked me to get with John Oh and bring him up to speed on everything that we use.  Although I think this is a good idea, I think that this direction should more appropriately come from you.

Please let me know what you would like me to do, if it would be beneficial to have me explain our stuff to both John and Victor, I will be happy to do so.

Thanks,

C

I am interested in being part of this effort if there is still room

Hi Frank,

Thanks for taking care of the password changes for our real time group.  

Things are still very up in the air here. We hear new developments nearly on a daily basis, and so much remains unknown. I am in kind of a wait and see mode.

Thank you for asking!

Cara

Hi Mom,

Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.

I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.

School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  

I love you!

Cara

Very Cute!!
Cheri

I am still having lots of problems with OATI

We are experiencing problems with the voicemail system.  PGE has Qwest working on it now.  I will follow up with status when it is repaired.
 
Dave

I will be surrendering my cell phone when Enron no longer wishes to pay for it	

AT&T may begin suspension of some Enron Corporate cell phone accounts beginning Friday, 12/7.  All remaining Portland cell phone accounts will be terminated no later than 12/11.  

Individual cell phone users may keep their phone and phone number by accepting financial responsibility for the account going forward.  You may convert your phone to a personal account and request the same phone number or request a new one.  Susan Nothnagel, AT&T Representative, will be here on Friday, 12/7, 1:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. to answer any questions and switch your cell phone to a personal account upon request.  If Friday is not convenient Susan will stop by next week as needed.  AT&T will waive the activation fee to change the account.

Management approved cell phones are eligible for expense reimbursement, based on business need.  Please see your manager regarding cell phone reimbursement.

Regards,

Chris

I need to get my loan approved and my bonus in hand before I can move in,  I am anxious!  woohoo!

We don't have them here, but I will call Stamford and see what I can do.

Thanks!
Amy

There are BPA real power losses for the 7th only  and some transmission only paths

  

I propose that while work is so slow we have some informal tutorials from the folks who know stuff.

SQL
Access
Excel Stuff (Susie is a bona-fide expert teacher!)
HTML
XML

Whatever folks might want to teach

thanks Tara

Cara

I wanted to let you know you have read-only access to the CWI for viewing
your lossess, ancillary services and transmission information.  However,
when you log in now, you will need to use your current user id but your
password has been reset to default.  Type in default as your password and
then you will be prompted to enter a new password.  After you do this, you
will then have read-only capability.  If you have any questions, please let
me know.  I'm at 360.418.2009

Les

You also will have read-only access now but you will not be prompted to
change your password.  We did the change under a blanket authority so it
only requires Cara to change hers.  You should be able to continue to use
your current user id and password and be fine.  If you have any questions,
please let me know.  

Thank you,

Tara Exe
BPAT

I can pop up today if you would like,

Just give me a call and I can dash over.

Thanks,

Hi Mom,

I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  

Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.

Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  

I love you,

Cara

Hi Sweetie,
 
I still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.
 
We are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!
 
I love you, and Pat and Riley

Understanding Enron
FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.
FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk.
PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.
APPLIED COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.
TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.
MEXICAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.
CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Good Morning,

I never got a copy of my UBS agreement, and Amy said you have been keeping them in case something happened to the FED-EX packages?

I can run up and grab it anytime.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland!  :)

 

No changes to any existing data, just adding Real Power Losses

Thank you for your kind words.
 
This is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.  Dave needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends. Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.
 
I am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends. 
 
I promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.
 
Love,
 
C

Dear Cara; 
I want you to know that I love you no matter what 
you and Dave decide. Love, Mom 

Her mailbox must be full or something, we are getting her mail kicked back

Can we tidy up her mail a bit, she returns on Tuesday

I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.

Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.  I told them and they did it on the spot.

They also referred me to this website

www.americanexpress.com/rewards

I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience

Cara

Dave said he called you.  I feel awful.

I want each of you to get out of here for 30-45 mins, I will babysit your stuff while you are out.

This is the smallest sheet in the history of the world

I had to over-return losses, please call if this poses a problem

Cara

 

sempergers@hotmail.com (at least while I still am a semperger, but I am getting divorced)

We will see you back in the states.

We obviously don't have an elaborate backup plan yet, as we were too busy working for the "The World's Leading Company".  So we can't say where we will eventually end up, but please keep in touch and let us know how you all are doing.  We miss working with all of you guys.  If there is an email list for Portland put together, someone send it our way.  

Hang in there!

I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

Hi Guys,

Before it all goes in the tubes and people start to bail, I wanted to get your addresses, if you don't mind to send you the wedding invites.  I can just pass on the info as well, just let me know.

Thanks Tons!

just remember me when you are the boss and are hiring

I was starving!  You rock.

Never know when this will come in handy

 

doubt that is necessary now

Cara:

BuildRoute report is ready for testing now.  Please see version 3.2.3.10 in enpower stage environment.  Two optional check boxes are created as requested: "exclude DART" and "include DART only".  Let me know if it works to your expectation.

Fran

Good morning!
BuildRoute Version 3.2.3.10 is ready for testing.  
I will try to help if you have any questions, but you will be better off calling Nikolay (713-345-7265) with any questions about this.  Please see Bill's email for all the details I know.
Thanks so much for your help.  Sorry I am not more so.
Laura
713-345-4410

QA's:

	BuildRoute has been modified to allow the exclusion of DART deals.  Since they are waiting on it, it is difficult to test and Nik has done quite a bit of testing anyway, we promoted it to Stage.  Please contact Fran Chang about testing.  If it goes OK and she wants to, we can put it in as a production break fix.

Regards,
Bill x53492

Here you go, if you ever have a spot open for me.

I need to hold off for a couple of weeks.  Sorry :(

Hi Cara,

I hope things are going well for you today and that you had an enjoyable
Thanksgiving.

I just wanted to follow up with you regarding your order.  I know you wanted
the basket with the lightbulb, but I wanted to know if there was anything in
particular that you wanted added or deleted from the basket.

Also, I am needing to know when you would like me to deliver these.  You can
email me addresses and the message for the cards.

Thank you for your order.
I hope you have wonderful Holidays.
Renee

I can't wait, what goodies can I bring?

We are pretty much wrapped up.

Thanks Matt.

I have re-started Enpower since the e-mail came out saying that the new version has been put into production.

I ran the attatched sheet, and the last group of deals that I was given had old deals blended with new deals.

These start on line 757.  

Cara

 

Donald was trying to sort by POR AND POD,  Donald gets a repeating error of "invalid variant type conversion".

I tried to do that and no problem, but I am using the app locally, and Donald for some reason still has to go thru the windows 2000 terminal server.  I really want him to be able to use the app locally like it was designed to be used.

Please let me know.

C

It happened twice

Cara,
Did the error take place again, or did it just happen the one time.  If it
just happened the 1 time, everything is ok, the server that you were on just
restarted that piece of code.  If it is continually happening, please let me
know right away.  From the logs that I was able to look at, everything
looked fine so I think the server just restarted that piece of code.  Please
let me know if it keeps happening.
Thank you,

We also need a box that says "Include only Dart Deals"

Please also  make absolutely sure that this is included in the PSW build route, as we use it nearly exclusively now.Vish knows about our problems with that.

Cara

Cara:

Please see the attached email below for what IT is planning to modify Build Routing report to accomodate and differentiate DART products.  From what we've discussed, you would like to have the default as with the "exclude DART deals" checked, right?  Also, did you also say you want IT to create another function for this report to run DART deals only (so the report will only show DART products) so real time schedulers can run it to see what he/she needs to pick up?

-Fran

Fran,

We worked on excluding the DART deals from the BuildRoute report.
The report will look like that:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 
If you have the "Exclude DART deals" box unchecked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP1_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 
Deal 500056.1 is a DART deal.

If you have "Exclude DART deals" box checked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP2_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 

Please let me know if that's what you need to see.
I can send you similar files that show more then 3 deals.

Thanks!
Nikolay

 
Bill:

Since the Enpower status meeting is cancelled today, just wanna follow up with you on the progress of the DART project.  I would appreciate it if you could let me know so I can update the traders on this.

Fran:

	The change would not take long provided if we could easily identify DART deals.  At this point we will have to research identifying DART deals.  We don't know the answer yet.  There is a higher priority project (secondary legal entities) which we hope to complete next week.  We'll schedule this change after that.

Regards,

Bill:

EOL IT group (Torrey Moorer) has created a new DART product for us in testing stage.  We will need the Build Route Reports to be revised accordingly (please see the attached emails).  Would you have someone in your group work on this and let us know the timeline so we can follow up.  Please call me if you have any questions.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about). 

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Hi There,

I love you, I hope you have a good day.  Work is shaping up to be a real snooze-fest. There are only 9 of us on the entire trading floor right now. Normally there used to be about 65-70 of us!

Waking up with you is so nice, I am looking forward to many years of doing just that. I think we are going to settle in just fine together. I love you and enjoy being with you so much. You are the man I have waited all these years for. Thank you for being part of my life.

I will see you this evening, a little dinner, a little laundry action, maybe a little dominoes and sheet-she-me?  Woohoo!

I love you,

CF

We need to be able to rely on the repeated running of the build route. Running a month long sheet from scratch is a huge problem for us, it forces us to do massive amounts of work over and over again.

I need you to find out why this is happening, and let me know when it is fixed.

I propose we just keep AOL

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.
  

I plan to send them in a batch to you through interoffice mail on Feb 8th.

Please call me at 503/464-3814 if you have any questions

Thanks,

Other deals is fine,

Build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine, and including them in the off peak sections. We must be able to see these deals, as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules.

Thanks,

Cara

Hi,

We are categorizing the deals in Build Route depending on type of the deal:

If the deal strip is during Peak hours, Build route includes theses deals in On Peak deals section
If the deal strip is during Off-Peak hours, Build route includes these deals in Off-Peak deals section
If the deal strip is for 24 hours, Build route includes these deals in 24Hour Section deals

 We are observing few deals strips only for few hours and not follows any of the above mentioned sections, they are not part of any Peak/OffPeak/24Hour section, and Build route is not selecting these deals.
I am proposing to add one more section called "Other Deals" and to include all these deals in this section. 

Please let me know, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments in this regard. 

Thanks,

Auntie Cara,
 
How are you?  I am doing fine, I guess.  I think I am passing through the shock stage and may be entering the exceptance stage.  I am still so dazed from this whole thing.  I am supposed to go back to work on the 5th and may not be going back at all.  This whole thing is so heartbreaking.  
 
I am attaching my resume just so you have it, if you think of anyone who should see it from you contacts please pass it on.
 
Take care and I will keep you posted.

Alan,

The forwarded message below contains an issue cited by Dick Ingersoll back in June of 1997 in which Control Areas were changing the properties of our submitted schedules/transactions (tags?) and not informing us.  In a subsequent letter in September 2000 Dick had noted an imporvement but with Enron still experiencing some minor problems.

My question(s) to you and the traders/schedulers are, are the problems noted above still occuring, is this still causing us problems and if so are there specific incidents that you can provide to me so I can pass them on to the WSCC?

Please accpet my wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving!

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS
The Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE>) told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question.
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan. 
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further.
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon.
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night.
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=DYN>), its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through

would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September.
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year.
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities.
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced.
"Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank," Ms. Coale said. "But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived."
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced.
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - currently $11.71 an Enron share.
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9.
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million.
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet.
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
"It is not possible to predict," Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. "An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern."

Murray,

We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.  These logins are to allw the ubs schedulers to continue to perform for us after there login is converted to the ubs system.  I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what?

I would like to get together with the people who have management responsibilities today.  I have no news, but I'd just like to get together with you guys to get your read on how people on the floor are doing.  I'd like to get your thoughts on what we as a management team should be doing to keep our team focused / informed / productive / happy ....

Let's meet at 2 PM in Mt. St. Helens.  Let me know asap if you won't be able to make it.

Understood.  I had populated the market path first

The PSEs in the Physical Path are not populated until the PSEs in the Market
Path are selected.  As promised in training, the PSE's in the Physical Path
will always be a short list derived from the Market Path, saving the person
who is entering the tag from wading through all unnecessary PSE codes, since
no PSE should ever show up in Physical Path who was not part of the
financial chain.

Good Afternoon,

I have attempted several times to make a test tag today, but the drop
down lists for the PSE's in the Physical path area have not been
populated.

I logged off and onto the system several times today to see if that
would help. It didn't.

Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

Thought you might want a little humor in your day?..as dumb as it may be!
 

 
Very sensitive letter.  Scroll Down Slowly as you read.

I was able to create a tag, but when I confirmed, nothing happened.so I hit confirm a few more times, and got 5 copies of the same e tag

I would be personally interested in going to D3,  please try to plan it during mid month if possible.

Please let me know if you would be interested in attending a Derivatives III course in Portland (next year).

(We are working to create a training calendar for 2002 and would like to be sure we have enough interest to offer DIII next year.)

Thanks!

Hi My Man,
 
Yokos! mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I went to see Dr. Soot today, she told me my pain is from the 2 big knots where they started and ended the incisions, and it will only hurt for ...oh....3 months or so.  She also said I can do whatever I want, including the gym! Your ASS is MINE!  ;)  She said lifting etc is fine as long as I listen to my pain and lift things slowly. No jerky or quick lifting that could hurt me.

I am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price!

I wanna do the 19 grand package. Employees and Spouses. Do for us but do the works.

I think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now.

C

Attached is a spreadsheet indicating pricing for a Customer Ski Trip, as well as several pricing options for an In-house trip.   

The dinner priced for the in-house trip would be either a pizza and salad buffet or a Mexican fiesta buffet.  The meal selected for the Customer event is a Western Bar-B-Que.

Mt.Bachelor is debuting a tubing hill this year, and I have requested a group price quote for that activity.  I'll let you all know what I find out, but it sounds like a blast.

Hi

Donald is having an access violation when he tries to run the Path Confirmation Report. Vish is aware of this, and wants to do some investigating tomorrow, but I don't know if Donald will have time.  Maybe you can do this with Vish and Donald's Passwords?

Stacy still has performance issues running the report launcher locally.

I am just ducky.

C

I found the following problems when using the preschedule workspace.

When I ran the error check for my sheet on the 17th, there were no errors to report.  I proceeded to run the confirmation  and route deals and noticed that on some of the rows my supply mws were not equal to my market mws.  This discrepancy should have been caught by the error check function.   The system allowed me to run my confirm anyway.  

Thanks,
Stacy

The old build route remembered what the user chose last for delivery points, and had it in the defaults each time Build route was opened.

Can this be duplicated in the PSW version of build route?

C

Please have the default set to "Starting on" not  "Active on".

We use Starting on Every day, and Active on much more rarely.

Thanks,

MUCH INTEREST FROM ME

 
Anybody have candidates for this?
 
Tim
 
A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

Hi Mom,

I am so glad that Nathan seems to be responding, his well being and future are what is most important. I don't know what to say to the behavior of Beth not taking responsibility for the financial end, and kind of holding you both hostage with this unspoken threat to withold your grandchildren.  I have so little respect for her for treating people this way. If I didn't think she would punish you somehow, I would tell her so.

I am looking forward to seeing you next week!  woohoo!

Things are coming back a bit, here is your sheet

Please copy me on anything that you need to speak to the developers on.  DART changes to the build route need to be done in the PreSchedule Workspace version of build route, as that is what we are using now, we have been phasing out the old build route.

Cara

Noted about the changes need to go thru you.  For now I only forwarded the request for adding a check box for option to exclude DART products.  From what you wrote, seems like we need the report to be able to show DART deals only, so real time can see it.  So basically we have two requests:  one to enable us to exclude/include DART deals and one to enable us to run DART deals only (while excluding all other deals that are going to be scheduled day ahead?)

* when IT gets back to me on the addition of the check box I will let you know so you can play around to see if that's how you want it to work.

-Fran

Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day. Any change to it must go thru me.

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.

Cara

Cara:

Just so you know I have submitted a request to Bill Crook's group (Bill Crook took over Will Smith's old responsibilities).  I will keep you and Sean posted when IT made progress on this.  I am curious what this Build Route report is and how schedulers use it, generally speaking.  Also, I understand that you would like to see the DART products excluded (by a check box) in this report.  While they won't show up in this report in the future, where should the deal info show up in stead in order for Real Time scheduling to pick it up?  Do we need real time position manager modified accordingly as well?

Maybe next time when you run the Build Route report I can go over and watch a bit, if you don't mind.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Fran

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about). 

Sean:

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Good Afternoon,

The last of our kinks has been worked out and we are going to go ahead with all schedules in the new system as of 11/15. We will then have a good couple of weeks under our belt before the start of a new month. The last date you will see any preschedules in Lotus is 11/14/01

Please see me if you have any questions.

Just let me know when the update has been done, and I will pop in and do a few more tags.

Thanks,

Tom and I confirmed this change via phone earlier.

C

 

No, I will just make a note of these two strange deals

Cara,

The Deals 576490.1 & 737863.1 are booked in strange way, we segregate these deals depend on the Day week Mask, 

If DOW is  -MTWTFS- (Monday thru Saturday, excluding Sunday & Holidays), for WEST desks we segregate them into  1-24 Hours category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400) 
If DOW is S------H (Sunday and Holiday, except Monday thru Saturday), for WEST desk we segregate them into Off Peak Deals
If DOW is -MTWTFS--(Monday thru Friday, excluding Saturday, Sunday & Holidays), for EAST desks we are secreting them into  1-24 Hours Category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400)  
If DOW is S------SH--(Saturday, Sunday & Holidays excluding Monday thru Friday), for EAST desks we are secreting them into Off Peak Deals

Where as 
Deal # 576490 DOW is -MTWTFSH,  that is  the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section
Deal # 737863 DOW is SM--TFSH, that is the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section

If you want to segregate the deal into OnPeak/24 Hours/Off-Peak  depending on the number of hours it is flowing, not depend on the Day Week mask, let me know I will make the changes required in Pre - Schedule Work Space an release it in the next version.

Thanks,
Vish

Good Evening

I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the "OFF PEAK" deals. 

The deal numbers are:

576490.1	 
737863.1	 

Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?

Here is my PSW sheet:

Thanks for that laugh! I needed it.

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.

My new Company is called  "Cara-land".  I am working on the national anthem now.

Cara,

Stella and I have been communicating via email and have determined that your vending machine was involved in this somehow.  It all started with Pollard, your predecessor.  Any comments, Ms. Semperger? (we're waiting for your confession)

Susie and I talked, she and I agreed that she would work 7-1 m-th,  and 7-5 on fridays.  We had agreed to that before she left.
 
I also filled her in on our situation as a company, she had no idea.  I didn't want her to get blindsided by any kind of decision.

Hi.  I talked to Julie Kearney about my hours.  She said 7 to 1 is 30 hours a week and I need to work 32 hours a week to keep my benefits the way I have them.  Would it be ok if I worked 7 to 1:30?  I'm pretty sure my babysitter can stay an extra half hour.  I'm also planning on making arrangements to work later on the last 3 days of each month to set up for the new month.   

Let me know what you think.  You can email me back or call me.  I'll be home for about one hour and then I have an appt. 591-9681 Talk to you soon. 

please call  503/464-2099 for the conference phone, I have a dr. appt and cannot attend.  All the schedulers will be there, David Steiner and Diana Scholtes and Sean crandall will also attend.

I don't think we will be able to participate in testing unless we have our TISN registration done and our new OATI account setup

ISAS Members and Interested Parties,

OATI is currently not prepared to accommodate open ended testing during the
WSCC test period of now through Tuesday, February 12, 2002. However, they
have graciously agreed to provide us with two, four hour test periods as
follows:

Thursday, February 7, 2002, 0800-1200PPT
 
Monday, February 11, 2002, 0800-1200PPT 

Please make best efforts to kick the tires on E-Tag 1.7 during these time
frames. We have attached another copy of the WSCC testing guidelines.

Thanks and Good Luck!

 <<E-Tag  Functionality Test V_1.pdf>>  <<E-tag Functionality Test
Report.doc>> 

  

I have created a short list of phone numbers based on what is active now, and it is saved in P:/Scheduling/PHONE NUMBERS

I have also asked Dave Steiner to print out my turret numbers for your reference.

 

Everything that we use is located in P:/Scheduling.  You will find old sheets with tags and paths, documents outlining how the system works, how daylight savings time needs to be represented, there is also the Intranet site

P:\Scheduling\EnronWestSchedulingWebsite.html

On this there is the OATI links, and also the test site for OATI 1.7.  This will go live in April, and will be totally different than any tagging done before. You will need time to get familiar with the new format and practice, and I will be happy to help guide you when you are ready.

All 3 of us are here to help, and will be available to you until you are comfortable.

Good Luck!

Within a couple of weeks, most of the Enron folks will no longer be active, and I will have no access to the system.  Mike Purcell will be handling the account and can be reached at mike.purcell@enron.com

Please call me at 503/464-3814 within the hour if there is additional information that you need to set up Serena and Mike's logins by the end of today.

Thanks

When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

For those companies that have not yet acquired OATI Digital Certificates, to start the process, please download the Company Information document at the following URL:

For those companies that have already acquired OATI Digital Certificates, our OATI webTag Administrator will be contacting your company shortly to activate this service with your current E-Tag 1.67 access.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us at (763) 553-2725 or support@oatiinc.com.

I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846

We are going to plan on being there for the Enron schedulers, until they are ready to fly solo

I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.
 
Tom.

UM ,  NOBODY IS TRAINED HERE, WE HAVE HAD EXACTLY ONE DAY'S NOTICE TO PULL THIS TOGETHER!

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?

Cara, 

Can you double check this deal for me.  Utah is saying that this deal did not flow after the 12/1/01.  I have looked at the SW sheet and it looks like it was cut, but I want to make sure.

Deal 533980.4

Just so there's no confusion: I, too, have accepted a position with UBS War=
burg to be a part of its regulatory affairs team.

Alan Comnes

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what =
has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what=
 is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologi=
zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the=
 last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=
ple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through=
 who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=
o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=
, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=
, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addi=
tion to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have ac=
cepted positions with UBS Warburg:

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Good Afternoon,

Lots of difficulty getting good information today, please call asap if there is a problem

Got this error

 

<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>

Not always feeling better.  I am very sore today

Tim,

I just want to tell you how much I respect and admire how you have handled this situation. It is not lost on many of us that we owe not only our bonuses but also our jobs to you personally.

I am glad to be part of the new crew, and wanted you to know that I am grateful for all of your efforts on my behalf over the years. It is not often that an assistant is given the opportunities to advance that I was given.  

Thank you.

Cara

 

These are the open positions for the Month of February. This is the best way to see our obligations.

Good Afternoon Sweeite,

I have my new driver's license and my divorce papers to change my name over to just plain Cara Freeland.

Do I send them to you or what do I do?

also-

Have you heard if parking or Tri-met will be subsidized at all in the New World Order?

Lemmie Know,

Cara Freeland

You are so cute!  Next time you work a day shift, call me and we will go have coffee and Iwill give you all the sordid details of my divorce and my now nearly 7 week stand.
 
Juicy juicy stuff!
 
 

Cara;
You owe ME a conversation!  I can't stand missing a gossip session!
Congrats on your offer and acceptance!  How exciting, and you earned.  You have always beed a good, heads-down, committed employee.
I got a sniglet of the personal life, but not enough.  Fill me in, please.  Are you separated?  If so, I hope that you are doing well getting through it all.
Well, I'll await your responses, and look forward to working with you in the future!
- Cheri (from PGE pre. & the SKI TRIP!!!!!)

Hi Honey,

I hope you are having a good day, I sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning. (Although I had a little bout of blue bush) I just love having you around all the time. 

I don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, I wanna take us out to dinner. Where would you like to go?  Or we can be turds again tonight and to to YOKO's tomorrow, or whatever.

I am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate VS the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.

I love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!

Love,

Cara Freeland

I have definatly missed you.  I have missed everyone.  I like my new job but Sean was right, it is very slow paced here.  I find myself fighting for things to do some of the time.  I live on my own, I really dig my new pad.  It's definatly different living by myself.  Please tell everyone I said hello and if they want my address or phone number you are welcome to pass it on.

Thanks for your addy, it was so good to hear your little voice yesterday! Things are sure different here, Mark and Tom are not staying, Holden is in real time, and possibly Mallory will trade the SW.  

I miss YOU!

Donald will be helping you with that, he has taken over the NW now for Feb.

Bill and I are considering having Real time do the EPE preschedules since they are the ones that live and die by them anyway.  That way you would be released from that burden and any errors would be all on the ownership of RT.

I'll be out tomorrow and Thursday back on Friday.

Diane Cutsforth will be working on the EPE schedule. She can be reached at 503-464-3831.

See ya'll Friday.

Hi Sweetie,

Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.

The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.

I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.

See you tonight,

C

Let me know if your stuff does not pull in correctly from Enpower or you have any other problems.

Thanks!

Cara, 

	The pos0201 spreadsheet is out there.   We will use CRC as an upstream at Mead 230 HLH and El Paso Electric as an upstream at Four Corners LLH for wheeling to Pinnacle Peak.  AEP has been selected as the upstream for all other requirements.

Thanks 

Mark

I miss you and am wonderin how you are faring in the working world.   I have been checking in on the Riley photo site, she just gets more beautiful every day. 

Dave and I have signed papers and are final, now I am just waiting for the house to sell.  I have already found another place to live, and have an offer on it based on the sale of my house.

I love you and hope to hear from you soon.

Cara

Can you tell me if we are having subsidized parking and bus passes?  If not, I need to plan ahead.

Thanks,

I was able to login to the main platform of Enpower under csemper, but not able to run psw or deal entry.  However, I was able to login as drobins and run things.

Please do what you can to get my login fixed today if possible. I will use Donald's login as a workaround.

Thanks,

Cara

I tried to login with the est_csemper id in estate enpower, and was denied login

Hi Dear Man,

I feel the same way that you do, I feel like you are a gift that the universe has given to me. You are such a rare and special man. I love being with you and having fun with you, I love your tenderness and your competitiveness and your sense of humor.  What did I ever do to deserve you!

If we aren't too tired tonight, let's go poke around a store or something. Maybe linens and things to look for kitchen stuff??  We are going to have such fun together.

I love you,

CF

Good Morning Honey,

I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  

You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what I am going to do".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.

I am looking forward to forever with you.

Love,

CF

Hi Sweetheart,

The trip and all really took it out of me, I am taking off for home now, looking at a little nap action and then if I feel good start packing.  I love you and will see you this after noon.

Don't work my man too hard, but I will rub your feet when you get home if you do!

Love,

CF

What did she say?

I told Gloria. :-)

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

CF

Please drop by when you can.  I get into regular Enpower but when I try to get into preschedule workspace I get an errr

Mine is all done, whiz quiz completed and Paperwork given to Gabrielle

Thanks.

Does this mean that the final stuff is done and we are all locked in for UBS? I understood that there was one final thing to happen before we were officially 'done'

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

Thanks!

Hi My Love,

I have told Sylvia and Cheri about you, and how important you are to me. Phase 1 is complete!  I am leaving in a few minutes for Bandon, and will drive sooooo carefully that it will become the stuff of legend.

I miss you already, it's going to be a long lonely weekend without you!  But I will see you on Sunday, and you are a DEAD MAN! ;)

I love you,

Cara

P.S. Don't cheat on your cards................................ :)

OK, 
I'm going to send to each of the schedulers the EPE procedure. Services is not part of UBS's horizons so my status is unknown. EPE needs have thier schedule completed. I'll do it if I'm still here. I plan on doing it Friday. We'll see next week.

Les, I am still not back from medical leave, please communicate with all 3 schedulers whenever you plan to be out.

I'll be out tomorrow. Could you please have one of the schedulers fill in the tag numbers. 

Les

I love you

C

I got all my stuff signed and done yesterday, so I am now Cara Freeland.  I want to get changed over ASAP in the system.

Thanks for your help, support, and kind wishes. You are among the very small group that I consider real friends.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland

just come get me when you are ready, but I don't normally hang out all day

Cara,

Let's get together Wednesday morning, at your convenience, to talk with Debra Bailey about our NERC identification number.

I want to go to the 10 am meeting, as I am Cara Freeland now.

My divorce papers were all done yesterday, and I will have final copies to you guys for your records in a month or so.

Cara

Please plan to attend the local UBS HR Presentation given by Gabrielle Hagele and Chris Lue tomorrow, Thursday, 1/24/02 at 2:00 PM in the Mt. Hood Conference Room.  The presentation will detail UBS Benefits and UBS HR Policies.  Time is also set aside for Question and Answers.  

Several UBS HR required forms will be distributed during this meeting.  These forms are required to process payroll and enroll in the benefit plans.  If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me or one of the UBS HR personnel.   See you then!

When you get the chance

Thanks

When you get a moment

Uh..........not when I came back to bed.  The score is now Craig 46,  Cara 21
 
 
LoL

THAT was a good one. 
 
I love you.
 
By the way...
 
You're up 21-7 :-)
 
 

Someone sent this to me, it seemed appropriate!

 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."
 
His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"
 
The old man replied, "It's fart football."
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7."
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead
17 to 14."
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"
 
And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."

Good Morning Honey,

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you,

Cara

Hi Dearie,

How are you?  I have been hearing your name more lately, and just wanted to touch base and tell you how much I miss you!  I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.

Do you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.

If you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.

I miss you,

Cara Poo

Are you still planning to come up and sign papers tomorrow?  I need to know because I had to go back to work early. 

Please call my cell phone when you get logged off so we can get in sync with plans.

Good Morning, 

Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.

 

I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.

Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.

His number is 503/464-3902

Thanks,

Cara

I spoke with Serena and told her how to roll scheduling forward.

Let me know if that doesn't do it.

CF

Cara,

I need to talk to you about Jan, it looks like nothing has been auto scheduled.  Serena is going to start doing the California deals.  It looks like from the 1/2 on nothing is in actuals.

Thanks

I was tickled to get such a cool card! Where did you find it?  I am thinking about taking the front off and putting it in a little frame.

I have decided to postpone the catchup Christmas party and instead have a housewarming party when I move into my NEW beautiful Condo that is right on a wetland/woods!  I go to sign papers today.

Thanks again,  

Luv Luv

Congratulations Steve!  How wonderful!  I love the name.  

She missed the tax deduction for 2001, and she missed being a New Year's baby, but we'll probably keep her just the same.  Mom and baby are doing fine.  Dad is still assessing.

Annabelle Grace Swain was born 01/02/02, (she and Kylie Kennedy can compete over whos birthday is on the worst date). She weighs 7lbs and is 20 inches long. Labor was 2 and a half hours (23 hours with Jethro). So far she's treating us right.

Good Morning..........sir,

I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.

I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  

You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

Any news?

I am just thinking I will leave around 1 pm here to go home for a bit. I don't have to be at this party till 7 ish, so if you wanna come hang out or just take a nap, you are welcome to do that.

;)

They think it is a proxy server on my end and that if it is removed we should be fine.

Can you help me with this?

Hi Donald,

I got a smattering of information that the big E will probably go after us contract folks that attempt to defect.  So, I guess it's second jobs for both of us.  I am sorry I got you into this, buddy.

Cara

Hi Again,

Just let me know about Lord of the Rings, when I am done here I am going home to take a nap if we aren't going.

If Saturday or Sunday would be a better lazy day than Christmas eve, then we can do whatever. You are the only thing on my calendar after tonight, sir.

Call me at work, I would love to hear your voice.

:)

Sara has been at a law conference since Wednesday.  She will overnight her 
information on Monday so you will have it first thing Tuesday morning.

Sorry for the delay.

As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the 
underpayment of $60,000.  I need the attachment which I have identified as 
merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We 
discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to 
the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will 
cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).  Also, instead 
of the term "Sonoco Price", I would prefer the caption "Floating Price 
recognized by Sonoco".  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks. Sara

I hope you had a safe trip back to Houston.  I found out Friday evening that 
I had the stomach flu and I was out of commission until today.  I hope I did 
not pass it on to you and Lynn.  

I noticed on Susan's report that the Duke master is still missing support 
documents.  Is this something that can be easily followed up on considering 
the possibility of entering into a trade soon?  Did we ever send them the 
documentation they were waiting for from us?  I tried looking at the swaps 
database but I can no longer get access for some reason.  Thanks.

What kind of publicity have we been receiving over the weekend?
I'm glad to hear that you're doing better.  You didn't look too good Friday.
We had a great flight to Sao Paulo and then on to Houston.  I highly 
recommend going out of your way to fly Continental.
Mark is in Portland for a few days.  We are in competition (with Broadband) 
for our star paralegal, but I don't give up easily.  Shari did announce to me 
about her departure and may tell the paralegals today (I hope)
Lynn and I are preparing a recap memo and we'll send a draft to you soon for 
comment
Talk to you soon.  Sara

In the first paragraph, my reference to "Enron Comercializadora ..."  SHOULD 
READ "Enron Comercializadora de Energia Argentina S.A."

Item 21 is actually a contract being reviewed by Bruce Harris and I.  I have 
already discussed the contract with Bruce, but last time I heard from him on 
the contract he had some questions for tax.  In any event, it is probably 
appropriate to take Andrea off of the list as the "commercial contract" and 
put Bruce Harris on instead.   That way people in Houston can start bothering 
the right person (ie, Bruce) when they wonder where it stands.

Hi All,
For those of you that don't know I am currently on a 7 week trip through
Africa, from Nairobi to Vic Falls, with my brother John-Henry. This will be
our means of updating all you boring non-traveller types of our adventures.
We arrived yesterday safe and well in Nairobi. We were tired, but had a full

day visiting an animal orphanage that raised these animals and set them back

into the wild. We were very priviledged to pet baby elephants, rhino and
zebra. We had a meeting of the folks we are travelling with and they all
seem really nice. All in their early 20's and I think I am mingling in well.

There are 8 of us on a truck made for 20 so lots of room. Last night we went

to a carvery that specialised in the local wildlife. Crocs, Zebra, antelope
that sort of thing. Today has been a long drive into Tanzania, to a place
called Arusha, from here we go off on a 3 day game drive over the serengeti.

We are staying in a place called Snakepark, which is a little unnerving, but

hell thats what we are here for.
We are both fit, well, happy and a little pink. I gave the first of those
little toys out today mum, there was a ?3yr old when we stopped for
charcoal. It took her a few minutes to touch the wiggling frog, but she
loved it. I had to bribe the others with pens so they didn't snatch it off
her. We are off now to eat as we skipped lunch and it is about 4.30pm.
Love to you all
Tessa and J-H

Hey Folks,

How is old blightey!!!
What a week J-H and I have had.
The 3 day safari around the Serengetti and Ngorongoro Crater was fantastic.
The 8 of us were split between 2 landrovers, that the rooves came off so we
had a really good view. We saw loads of game, basically everything. I was
most impressed with the 7 rhino - ok so 6 of them were in the distance and
we only knew they were rhino by looking through nans fantastic binoculars, a

quick thankyou to nan for lending them to me. And 6 cheetahs as I had seen
niether on my previous safari. Other things included 2 eagles eating an
impala up a tree, a leopard must have killed it and taken it up there, we
sat and watched a very bossy male zebra organising this whole herd of zebra
in and out of a watering hole in groups. Also elephant, lions - lots,
especially 11 sat on a large rock together, hippos, hyena, wildebeast,
warthogs, waterbuffalow, crocodile. I have probably left loads out, but you
get the drift, J-H made a list. In the evenings we camped and you will all
get to here J-h's story of the lion, but it is his story - niether lion nor
boy were harmed.
I will have to finish this tomorrow as I have loads more to say, but I have
to meet my group for a sunset beer.
Thanks Mandy for passing all this on. Give mum our love and reassure her
that J-H is really coming into his own.
Ross- don't you dare start lecturing me about settling down, you are only
doing it now and you are a dinosaur compared to me.

Love you all loads, and thanks for the replies.

Tessa

Ok Folks,
Where was I?
If you are interested we just made sunset last night and had a very welcome
cold beer.
Back to the adventure! The campsites we say in vary hugely, we range from
ones with just a hole in the ground toilet facility - like the one in the
Serengetti, to ones with proper toilets, showers with warmish water and
fully stocked bars!! In the Serengetti we were very close to nature. Too
close, we all went to bed early - this seems to be a bit of a trend, bed
before 10 most nights and up at 6, we have even made it up before sunrise a
few times. But the stories going between tents in the serengetti were of the

campers that have been lost to lions. Sure enough we certainly saw evidence
of their presence in the camp when we got up in the morning, even without
J-H's story. The next night after a long game drive, we camped on the edge
of the Ngorongoro crater, a bit windy, but warm, then as soon as the sun
went down it was bitterly cold and we huddled round the fire to eat our
supper, but all retreated to our sleeping bags soon after. It actually
turned out to be the best night sleep some of us had, especially as I always

find a lumpy bit of ground. I share a tent with a girl from Huddersfield
called Helen and we have the putting up and dismantling of the tent down to
a fine art.
The crater was fantastic, very bumpy and we were being thrown around the
back of the landrover as the driver did his best to get in front of a Rhino,

he did a brilliant job and it meant that the rhino passed by really closely.

That evening we went back to the snake park, to find our intrepid leaders
had finished doing some work on the truck. We were all desperate for
showers, even though you get dusty and mucky again very quickly it is lovely

for a while. We tried our best to wash our clothes, and managed to get the
semi clean. Since then Helen and I have discovered that it is easier to pay
a local to clean them properly and it only costs 15p for a pair of trousers.
The next day we played with the snakes for a while in the morning, they have

a baby pyhton we are allowed to hold, then J-H had a ride on a camel.
We went into Arusha to do a few things and stayed at a campsite the other
side of town, just to knock 20mins of the journey the next day. The cooking
has become a bit of a competition, J-H and I did the first dinner, rice and
stir fried veggies. Everyone thought it was great and it set a challenge for

the others, so people get a bit worried before its their turn. Since we did
just veggies, people have been adding meats, doing selection of salads,
cooking the rice with cashew nuts. It is getting like Ready Steady Cook,
when they started the chefs only did maincourses, now they do 5 course
dinners!!
We started the next day at 4.30am, it is a long drive from Arusha to Dar Es
Salaam, but we got to see the best sunrise over mount Kilimanjaro. During
these drives we are very pleased to be a select group, cos it means we get
to spread out and sleep. When we don't sleep it is really interesting to
watch the world go by and wave at the locals. They must be used to seeing
the trucks as quite a few do the same route, ours is the scruffiest - we are

very proud.
The campsite in Dar was right on the beach, we all ran in fora swim mand
gave up after we were over 100 yards in and syill only knee deep.
We had a morning in Dar and took the afternoon ferry over to Zanzibar. We
all fell deeply in love, it is the most beautiful place. We are staying in a

hotel here, Helen and I were in raptures over the ensuite bathroom and
airconditioning. We showered quickly and went off for dinner. In Stone Town
there is an evening market that is mainly selling cooked food, so you wander

down and take your pick. The first night I had tuna, squid and lobster, to
give you and idea, the lobster cost me about 80p. The group decided there
and then that we are setting up a commune here and turning our back on
civilisation.
Anywhere I can dine nightly on lobster gets my vote. We went on a spice tour

of the island yesterday, they grow everything from nutmeg to chilli to
cumerin. And all the fruit, bannanas, star fruit, mangos, pineapple, apples,

lemons etc etc, eat home even has their own tree that produces iodine for
any cuts they may get.
Obviously we went back to the market for dinner, J-H has challenged himself
to try and eat 5000 shillings worth - about 4 pounds, so far he is up to
3000. Today is a lazy day, postcards will be written etc. Tomorrow we are
off to stay at a deserted beach on the east of the island. This has been a
long e-mail - mainly for the family - cause the internet places will be few
and far between when we hit Malawi next week, so you may not here from us
for a week or 2. We will try whenever we can.
Love to all in breezy old England
Tessa

Dear All,

This is our last day in Zanzibar. We have just come back from the East
coast. It was very pretty, with few tourists or hotels. Unfortunately this
made the food and drinks more exspensive - ok, so we may only be talking
about 8p, but we are in cheap-sake travelling mood. There was also not a lot

to do, so it was 2 days of lying in the shade - the sun being too hot -
reading, playing cards and looking for shells on the beach. Boy what a tough

life I have!!
Our swahili is up to about 8 or so words.
Jambo - hello
Habari - how are you
Mizuri - beautiful
Mizuri-sana - very beautiful
Santa-sana - thankyou very much
Karibu - welcome
Fiti-Fiti - slang for very well
Thats about it.
Today we went to swim with the dolphins on the south coast. Apparently
nobody informed the dolphins and only a couple of pods turned up and they
were not in the playing mood. We got quite close to them and as soon as
anyone jumped into the water they were off - honestly you just can't get the

dolphins!!
Then we snorkelled on the reef for a while, there seemed to be quite a bit
of damage. I was really annoyed by a fella that kept diving underneath me
and picking things off the coral. Some people are sooo ignorant - sorry
Ulli, I love you to pieces - but they were bloody Germans.
We have our last meal at the harbour stalls tonight and take the 10pm ferry
back to Dar. Because of some silly rule they won't let us into Dar until
6am, so we kip on board ship.
Then we are back to our wonderfully dusty old truck and more bush camps.
As I said before Malawi is very poor and unlikely to have lots of internet
cafes so it may be a week or 2 before the next one.

Loads of Love

Dear All,

Welcome back mum and dad, hope India was fab. The gang over here think the
Weltons are trying to take over the world.
Well, it has been a long time since the last update. This is due to Malawi
being a very friendly but poor country.
The adventures in the last 9 days are too much to go into too much detail.
The partying started in ernest at Lake Malawi, up until then the driver
thought we were a little slow, I was up late, but everyone else was flaking.

Our first big night the weltons did well, winning a drinking game each and
not being any of the 3 people that passed out. The next big night a few days

later we didn't do so well, the other boys think it is very amusing to get
J-H plastered and they have found 2 drinking games that he is really bad at.

He has even started praticing on the truck as we travel around. That night
though was a bad taste night and we had all had a budget and went to a
clothes market and bought each other outfits. Everyone was hoping I looked
bad, but a very nice unimaginative bloke just bought me an overall, I was
disappointed. All the lads had frocks, J-H had a fetching orange silky
blouse and silky skirt, he looked surprisingly fetching. Slightly less so
when passed out on the toilets 3 hrs later, or passed out on the floor in
front of the toilets, and he annoyed a few people when he woke up at 4.30 am

demanding to know where the party was - loudly. Apart from the parties we
have seen and done other things we have visited a school, a hospital, a
mountain or 2, had a tribal village meal and a brewery. That last one was
really tough. The gang are getting on really well, some how a hitch-hiker
has joined us, but he's cool. We had a couple of days of heavy rain, so
people were getting fed up with the tents, the mozzies have been on great
form, but its Africa and we love it. The crew have been trying to persuade
us to stay till Cape Town and if I didn't have fixed plans I would be here a

few more months. I shall return.
Now we are in Harare the capital of Zim. Just to make any of you sports
lovers sick, we have found out where the England cricket team are and will
be going to their hotel to watch the 6-nations rugby this pm and supporting
them in their one day against Zim tomorrow. As I said its a hard life. Last
night we went to a local night club and the band were amazing and still
going when we left at 3.30 am. I have just enough time to do a spot of
shopping before going to find Goughie and the boys.
I have probably left loads out, but nevermind, you are all going to have to
listen to my stories anyway.
Tessa

Brent:  attached is a draft memo that Lynn and I prepared.  We would 
appreciate your comments.  Also, who else do you think should be a recipient 
of this memo?  Should we prepare a separate "Action Plan" or strategy to 
submit to Mike?  You may recall in our meeting of Friday last that Mike 
committed to assess the long term situation in BA (at least I think that's 
what he agreed to do) and we (foolishly) committed to prepare a review of our 
activity in BA.  Maybe we can discuss on Friday morning at 9 am (Houston)/12 
pm (BA).  Let us know if you have any questions.  I believe that Lynn is in a 
seminar on Thursday.  Sara

FYI - Mike Ettringer from Portland called to follow up on this ISDA.  Not to 
worry, I'll let him know it's in the works.  SS

John Suarez entered into a 2-day swap with NYSEG papered with NYSEG'S "deemed 
ISDA" which I am reviewing.  Are we confirming financial in the name of 
EPMI?  Do you want to pursue the ISDA?  Tanya, are you still the credit 
person for this electric utility?  Is anyone speaking with these traders?  SS

It's not at the top of my list.   Sorry. We'll have to meet tomorrow to 
discuss the situation.  SS

Susan Bailey
03/09/2000 11:04 AM
Sara,

This morning I spoke to Steve Morus @ Puget Sound.  He was inquiring as to 
the status of the draft ISDA Master Agreement.  As you may recall, on 
February 3rd, I prepared a draft for your review.  I beleive this draft was 
nto sent to the counterparty due to some thoughts you had concerning our IOU 
provisions.  Steve is eager to recieve the draft if such matters have been 
resolved.

Let me know if I may be of further assistance.

Susan 

Mike:  An ISDA Master Agreement is currently in the works for Deseret.  Marie 
Heard is the paralegal and I'll probably take a look at the document.  Please 
bear with us as we have lost one of our attorneys and are swamped.  Thanks.  
Sara

I'm  busy today and tomorrow.  But I'll book up to 60 days in advance (like 
the French Laundry in Napa) for you.  SS

Can you do lunch today?Yao

Brent:  sorry for my poor "attaching abilities."  Hopefully we will have a 
lot to discuss tomorrow.  Lynn has a suggested the use of a separate "action 
list" to present to Mike.  SS

The Transaction must get papered whether its GTC's or a Deemed ISDA.  The 
convention in the physical world (as I understand it) is that the seller 
sends its paper.  SS

Tanya Rohauer
03/09/2000 12:29 PM
Tracy - since I 'm in class today and tomorrow will you find out what John's 
up to and circle back with Sara?  The deal should be papered as ENA.  Sara, I 
cannot imagine why we need a Deemed ISDA for a two day deal....if John 
indicates plans for additional deals, we may want to pursue, but I don't 
think its necessary at this point.

By letter dated 3/9/00, Tembec Inc. has requested the transfer of "Contract 
No. EJ7774.1" dated 3/23/98 to the National Bank of Canada pursuant to 
Section 7 of the ISDA Master, to be effective April 1, 2000, but with Q1 
payment to be made to Tembec.  We do have a master with the National Bank of 
Canada.  Please let us know if this transfer is approved.  SS

The update is posted at approximately 6:00 PM EST every day.

1.  Thursday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               +154.20     +1.56%   10010.73
S&P 500                        +34.99     +2.56%    1401.69
Nasdaq                        +149.60     +3.05%    5046.86
Internet Stock Index           +42.29     +3.95%    1111.96

The Dow recovered in Thursday afternoon's trading session,
making big gains before closing up sharply, while Internet and
technology stocks propelled the Nasdaq to its fifth biggest
single-day point gain ever to close above 5000 for the first
time in history.

Thursday's early market action had all major U.S. indexes
performing lower following the Labor Department's report that
the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits increased
for the second consecutive week to 280,000 from 275,000 in the
previous week.  At the same time, however, a more accurate
longer-term measure showed that the closely watched four-week
moving average fell for the second straight week to 277,250,
which represented the lowest figure in 26 years.  Economists
view the four-week moving average as a more dependable indicator
of job market trends since it accounts for weekly fluctuations.

Notwithstanding the Labor Department's report, financial stocks,
which typically are sensitive to news related to potential
interest rate hikes, performed well, with American Express
(NYSE:AXP) edging up 1/8 (+0.10%) to 122 7/8, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) gaining 5/16 (+0.29%) to 107 11/16, Chase Manhattan
Bank (NYSE:CMB) closing up 2 1/8 (+2.69%) to 81 1/8, Goldman
Sachs (NYSE:GS) finishing up 5 7/16 (+5.34%) to 107 3/4, and
General Electric (NYSE:GE), which has a substantial financial
services component, rising 1 1/16 (+0.82%) to 131 3/8.

In other financial stock news, Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's
largest bank, and competitor Dresdner Bank AG, the third biggest
German bank, jointly announced on Thursday that Deutsche Bank
would commence a $30 billion takeover of Dresdner in a
transaction that would create the world's largest bank with $1.2
trillion in assets.  Under the deal, the combined company would
close approximately 800 branch offices and reduce payroll levels
dramatically.  It is estimated that these cuts would result in
annual cost savings of over $2.75 billion.  Following the
announcement, Wall Street began speculating about whether this
deal would put increasing consolidation pressure on U.S. banks,
including financial giant Citigroup (NYSE:C), which edged lower
by 7/16 (-0.87%) to 50 1/16.

One of the strongest performing sectors on Thursday was the
pharmaceutical idustry, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)
jumping 12.04% (up 5 3/4) to 53 1/2, Merck (NYSE:MRK) gaining
6.93% (up 3 15/16) to 60 3/4 and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closing up
8.11% (up 4 1/2) to 60.

Insurance powerhouse Metropolitan Life Insurance announced on
Thursday that it would acquire the remaining interest in
insurance asset manager and research firm Conning Corp.
(Nasdaq:CNNG) in a deal valued at approximately $68 million.
MetLife already has a 61% stake in Conning that was captured
through MetLife's January acquisition of Conning's indirect
majority owner, General America Corp.  MetLife, which is
scheduled to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange by
the end of March, increased its offer from $10.50 per share of
Conning to $12.50 per share.  Shares of Conning gained 15.98%
(up 1 11/16) to 12 1/4, while shares of other companies in the
insurance space performed well, with Chubb (NYSE:CB) rising 3/4
(+1.68%) to 45 1/2, Aetna (NYSE:AET) closing up 3 1/8 (+5.77%)
to 57 1/4, and Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) gaining
15/16 (+3.19%) to 30 5/16.

Investors reacted on Thursday to the request by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for more information relating to
the proposed $135 billion merger of America Online (NYSE:AOL),
the #1 Internet service provider, and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX),
the media and cable giant, after the initial filing by these
companies was deemed insufficient.  While a second request for
information by the Justice Department or Federal Trade
Commission frequently is viewed as a sign of potential delays in
approving a merger, analysts expect that the FCC request will
not delay significantly the agency's evaluation of the proposed
deal.  Shares of AOL rose 6 (+10.93%) to 60 7/8, while shares of
Time Warner gained 7 7/16 (+9.38%) to 86 3/4.

Among the big Dow movers on Thursday were:

<> Boeing (NYSE:BA), which closed up 3/8 (+1.12%) to 33 3/4
following the aerospace giant's announcement that an ongoing
strike could hurt the company's earnings and cause longer delays
of jet deliveries.

<> AT&T Corp. (NYSE:T), which dropped 3/8 (-0.71%) to 52 5/8
following news that Dan Hesse, president of the company's
wireless business that will be sold in what could be the largest
U.S. IPO ever, is leaving AT&T to take the helm at an Internet
start-up company.

<> Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP), which rose 11 (+7.81%) to 151 7/8
and was a driving force behind Thursday afternoon's recovery on
the Dow.

Internet and technology stocks continued to drive the Nasdaq
higher, with several companies hitting new all-time highs during
Thursday's trading session.  Among the several high-flyers
reaching new records were Redback Networks (Nasdaq:RBAK), which
jumped 32 3/16 (+9.82%) to 359 7/8, Nextel Communications
(Nasdaq:NXTL), which rose 15 15/16 (+11.63%) to 152 15/16, Cisco
Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO), which closed up 6 15/16 (+ 5.24%) to 139
5/16, and Phone.com (Nasdaq:PHCM), which gained 24 1/2 (+16.90%)
to 169 1/2.

GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO) announced on Thursday that it would
acquire AuctionRover.com, a resource for online auctions, in a
deal valued at approximately $170 million.  AuctionRover's
proprietary technology permits buyers to search for products and
services that are being auctioned in cyberspace.  Online search
engine GoTo.com operates an Internet marketplace that introduces
Web users to advertisers.  Shares of GoTo.com, which analysts
believe will benefit tremendously from its e-auction acquistion,
fell 2 5/8 (-5.20%) to 47 7/8, while shares of online auction
companies finished mixed for the day, with eBay (Nasdaq:EBAY)
dropping 1 1/2 (-0.82%) to 182 1/2, Yahoo (Nasdaq:YHOO), which
operates Yahoo! Auctions, gaining 6 1/4 (+3.53%) to 183 1/4, and
Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), which runs Amazon Auctions, closing up
5 3/16 (+8.15%) to 68 13/16.

In the wake of International Business Machines' (NYSE:IBM)
launch of a large-scale Internet campaign, the company announced
on Thursday that it has signed agreements under which local U.S.
telephone providers Bell Atlantic (NYSE:BEL) and SBC
Communications (NYSE:SBC) will test IBM's new Internet access
devices.  While IBM did not disclose the number of devices that
would be tested in the trials, analysts predicted that the
testing by Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications would be a major
step in IBM's efforts to shift its focus to the development of
products designed specifically for Internet access.  Shares of
IBM gained 1 3/8 (+1.29%) to 107 5/8, shares of Bell Atlantic
closed up 2 1/8 (+3.76%) to 58 5/8 and shares of SBC fell 1/16
(-0.15%) to 41 9/16.

Old economy fast-food titan McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD)
officially has entered the age of the Internet.  The world's
largest fast food chain announced on Thursday that it has made a
significant investment Food.com, which provides online food
takeout and delivery services.  McDonald's also is exploring
various online opportunities for some of its smaller restaurant
brands, including Donatos Pizza, Boston Market and Chipotle
Mexican Grill.  Shares of McDonald's rose 7/8 (+2.85%) to 31
5/8.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors
included:

<> Smith Micro Software (Nasdaq:SMSI), which skyrocketed 101.80%
(up 10 5/8) to 21 1/16 following the company's announcement that
it has developed a new wireless Internet access solution.

<> Globalstar Telecommunications (Nasdaq:GSTRF), which fell
12.99% (-2 11/16) to 18 and was one among the most active stocks
on the Nasdaq on Thursday following the downgrade of the company
by CIBC World Markets.

<> Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which rose 9.19% (up 8 13/16)
to 104 11/16 and rode the wave of a strong overall Nasdaq
performance.

Leading Internet and tech stocks performed as follows:

Company                      $ Change   % Change      Close
Amazon (Nasdaq:AMZN)          +5 3/16     +8.15%   68 13/16

H.J. Heinz Co. (NYSE:HNZ) announced on Thursday that its fiscal
third quarter profits increased 3.5% year-over-year as
acquisitions helped boost sales growth.  Earnings for the maker
of StarKist canned tuna, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and 9-Lives cat

food company best known for its ketchup gained 1/4 (+0.73%) to
34 1/2.

Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) reported on Thursday higher-than-expected
quarterly profits, as a partial result of greater sales of

from 32 cents a share in the year-earlier period, and exceeded
First Call consensus estimates of 38 cents a share.  Shares of
the #1 U.S. grocery chain closed down 5/8 (-4.07%)to 14 3/4.

Lands' End (NYSE:LE) announced on Thursday a 17% decline in

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF="http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

Two IPOs made their public debuts on Thursday amid a very
healthy, broad-market rally.  Shares of OraPharma, Inc.
(NASDAQ:OPHM), a developer of pharmaceutical products for the
treatment of oral diseases and disorders, bolted 73.61% to close
at 31 1/4, while shares of Riverdeep (Nasdaq:RVDPV), a provider
of technology based educational solutions, soared 243.30% to
close at 66 55/64.

In a show of strength, OTG Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:OTGS), a
provider of online data storage management and data access
solutions, sharply increased its pricing terms:  OTG's
underwriter increased the number of shares from 4 million to 5
million and increased the pricing range from $12-$14 to $16-$18.
In addition, Selectica, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLTC), a provider of
Internet selling system software and services, increased its
pricing range from $9-$11 to $23-$25.

It seemed impossible for investors to become any more excited
about technology/Internet stocks, but apparently they have.  To
find out more about OTG Software and Selectica and to learn of

Can we trade financially in Argentina?

Rodolfo Freyre@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
03/09/2000 02:42 PM
Rod,

We will be sending you the financial statements of Pluspetrol so that you can 
analyse it and send the credit worksheet to legal so that they fill the 
schedule and the credit support annex of the ISDA.  

Pluspetrol (CayCo) is interested in signing an ISDA with ENA so that they 
start hedging Crude Oil.  Pluspetrol is a very important company in Argentina 
and they are one of the largest crude oil producers.

We will send you the information soon.  

Tks,

Rolo

By letter dated 3/9/00, Tembec Inc. has requested the transfer of "Contract 
No. EJ7774.1" dated 3/23/98 to the National Bank of Canada pursuant to 
Section 7 of the ISDA Master, to be effective April 1, 2000, but with Q1 
payment to be made to Tembec.  We do have a master with the National Bank of 
Canada.  Please let us know if this transfer is approved.  SS

I've scheduled a meeting with Guy on March 30

Susan Bailey
03/10/2000 08:59 AM
Guy,

FYI -- the ISDA Master Agreement utilized by Enron for its 
financially-settled swap & option transactions is the industry standard.   
However, for your comfort in understanding how it works I suggest that you 
call Sara Shackleton in our group.   Sara is very well versed with the ISDA, 
and can give you a great overview.  Sara's extension is x35620.

As for your matter concerning a contract employee -- I concur with you and do 
not believe you are being overly cautious.  I have worked with Howard during 
my tenure with EOG, and will therefore revise page 2 of the Schedule to 
Master Agreement to reflect Howard Selzer's name and title.   You will 
receive replacement  page 2 today by messenger.  Please do me a favor -- 
switch out the replacement page 2 with the existing page 2, so the agreement 
will be ready to go for execution.

Give my best to Howard and thanks again.

Susan 

Guy Dayvault@ENRON
03/09/2000 05:20 PM
Susan
Good point.  However, our new VP & CFO is a contractor and thus not truly an 
officer of the company.  We have to be careful of this, so I would suggest 
that the title of the officer you place in the ISDA be our Chief Accounting 
Officer, since that individual (Howard Selzer) has the signature authority 
normally delegated to the VP CFO and he is the most senior employee in our 
department.
This may be being overly cautious here, but it is important that contractors 
not be treated as employees, especially with regard to officers of the 
company.

Thanks for the reminder on getting the ISDA returned.  Unfortunately there is 
no one I have located yet in our business unit who can explain the document 
or has seen one before which means I'm planning on spending at least several 
hours reading and understanding the issues & implications.  Perhaps you could 
help me.  Can you direct me to someone that routinely works with these 
documents that could walk me through the pages?  I think 30 minutes spent 
outlining the agreement & it's nuances would be useful.  If you have no 
ideas, just bear with me and I'll get to it. 

best regards
Guy

Susan Bailey@ECT
03/09/2000 03:46 PM
Guy,

It is my understanding that your VP & CFO will be joining Enron Corp.'s 
Investor Relations group.  In light of such development, I suggest that page 
2 of the ISDA Master Agreement dated August 24, 1999, between Risk Management 
& Trading Corp. (which you have yet to return in executed form)be revised to 
reference the title of the officer rather than the officer's name.

If such change is OK, I will forward the new page 2 for replacement to the 
EXECUTION COPIES in your possess.

As before, all of us are busy, but it would be most appreciated if you or 
someone in your group could see to the execution of this agreement.

Thank you.  

Susan 

I think you're the wonder woman of swapland.  Congrats.  SS

Susan Bailey
03/10/2000 11:17 AM
Sara,

I have just received word from Joe Kishkill.  He has signed the ISDA Master 
Agreement, dated effective July 27, 1999, between RMT and ESA.  We should be 
receiving shortly an executed counterpart for our files.

Yea.

Susan 

I know that we try to limit the provisions but we should consider:

1.  confidentiality (in the miscellaneous section, perhaps)
2.  setoff where there is no early termination date (is this covered by NY/TX 
state setoff laws?)

I'll try to meet with Carol and Shari next week to develop a list of 
issues/recommendations for you.  We may come up with more omnibus items.  SS

Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms 
- including the Omnibus Annex A.  Please give some thought to whether there 
are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to 
minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been 
changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many 
necessary changes made at this time as possible.

Mark

I think this should work for the group (including Mark and Shari)

Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip 
and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am 
not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your 
instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked 
to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master 
format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).  Also, I am not 
planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize 
our financial trading matrix.  I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the 
end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly.

There is a half day Argentine Derivatives Association conference scheduled 
for the afternoon of March 22 here in downtown Buenos Aires.  The topic will 
be primarily regarding credit derivatives.  I am planning on having Andrea 
attend and, if possible, I am planning on attending as well.  I think it is 
important that we begin to get involved in ADA activities even if we cannot 
currently transact in the nascent local derivatives market.  The cost will be 
$250 per person.  

Mark, I believe Sara has a copy of the ADA brochure if you are interested in 
getting more information regarding the association.

Brent

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.  Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning 
to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except 
with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are 
the subject of the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or 
not you agree or can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Sara and Gil,
John Greene is questioning why we need to execute through Merrill only since 
it may affect our abiltiy to get "best price".
thanks. sheila

Sheila,

Another question that is very impotant from a trading execution perspective 
is: why do we have to use Merrill ONLY?  This has obvious ramifications on 
how we execute the order.

BRAZIL: PRIMARY SURPLUS ON R$ 1.457BN IN JANUARY
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. a-7:-
 The primary surplus of the public accounts of the Brazilian government 
reached R$ 1.457bn in January 2000 (R$ 882mn in January 1999), including a 
Social Security deficit of R$ 725mn, taxes collection of R$ 15.144bn (R$ 
11.897bn in January 1999) and expenses of R$ 13.512bn (R$ 11.326bn in January 
1999).

BRAZIL: PROVISIONAL MEASURE FOR TAX ON FUELS
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. b-2:-
 According to a provisional measure which was signed on March 10th 2000 and 
will be valid from March 13th, the payment of the taxes PIS (Employees' 
Profit Participation Program), Pasep (Public Service Employee Savings 
Program) and Cofins (Tax for Social Security Financing) on the Brazilian 
fuels sector will be transferred to refineries.
With the change, the Brazilian federal government will avoid losses of R$ 
1.2bn in 2000 which would have resulted from the lack of payment of those 
taxes by fuels distribution companies which had won preliminary orders to not 
pay them, hindering the balance of the fuels market.

ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES AND FUELS PRICES
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/2:-
 Argentina's oil companies association CIP announced such companies will not 
reduce the price of fuels in the Argentine market, as such price was fixed at 
a US$ 28 value per barrel and it has increased to over US$ 32 over recent 
times. Jose Maria Ranero Diaz, from Repsol-YPF, remarked this sector's 
profitability margins are very low, only 5% while Juan Jose Aranguren from 
Shell expressed companies are working with important losses. 

ARGENTINA: "IT WAS THE RIGHT MEASURE" 
La Nacion (Argentina), 11 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 "If tax collection figures remain stagnant at current levels, taxes may not 
be reduced, anticipated Argentina's Minister of Economy, Jose Luis Machinea, 
who also qualified as "the right measure" the implementation of a tax reform 
which implied significant increases over income taxes. During a recent 
interview, the official also admitted the government will intensify its 
negotiations with oil companies to force them to reduce the price of fuels in 
Argentina, as some companies may be operating as monopolies. Machinea 
announced the government had urged Repsol-YPF to reduce its stakes in some 
energy areas, where it holds a dominant position. Lower tariffs on assets 
imported from Mercosur countries as well as from extra-Mercosur areas and new 
credit lines from the Nacion bank are some of the measures the government may 
include as part of the exports promotion plan it may launch soon. Finally, 
Machinea predicted Argentina's foreign debt will fall, as a result of the 
measures adopted by its government.

BRAZIL: INVESTMENTS AGAINST BLACKOUT
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. a-13:-
 The Brazilian National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel) informed on March 10th 
2000 that US$ 41mn will have to be invested in 2000 in order to eliminate 
critical points of the Brazilian interconnected system to avoid blackouts. 
The investments were estimated in a survey carried out by the Brazilian 
National Electric System Operator (ONS).

BRAZIL: COELCE WILL INVEST R$ 110MN
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. C-6:-
 Coelce, the electricity company of the Brazilian state of Ceara, will invest 
the amount of R$ 110mn in 1999 to expand its distribution network and in the 
automation of substations.

(Aneel) a readjustment of its prices, to be valid between April 2000 and 
March 2001.

BRAZIL: TENDER FOR LIGHT'S SHARES POSTPONED
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The tender for the sale of 9.23% of the control of the Brazilian electricity 
company Light, which was scheduled for March 14th 2000, will be postponed.
According to the new president of the Brazilian National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development (BNDES), Francisco Gros, the sale of Light's shares 
will be discussed in a meeting which will be held on March 13th, and then he 
decided to suspend the tender call.  

BRAZIL: INVESTMENTS IN CARIOBA
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. A-5:-
 The Brazilian energy company Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL), 
together with the companies Shell and Intergen, will invest the amount of US$ 
600mn to repair the thermoelectric plant of Carioba and put it to operate.
Carioba, which is based in the Brazilian city of Americana (state of Sao 
Paulo), is currently moved by combustible oil, but it will be transformed 
into a plant moved by gas.
This plant has generation capacity of 945MW and the prediction for the 
beginning of its operations is the year 2003.

BRAZIL: RHODIA'S PLANS FOR THERMOELECTRIC PLANT
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. A-5:-
 The French chemicals company Rhodia has a project to install a 
thermoelectric plant with generation capacity of 152MW in the Brazilian city 
of Paulinea (state of Sao Paulo).
The responsible for the operations of this plant will be Energyworks. This 
company will use 30MW of the generated energy, while the rest will be 
commercialised by Rhodia.

BRAZIL: COELCE REGISTERED PROFIT OF R$ 74.9MN
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. C-6:-
 The electricity company of the Brazilian state of Ceara (Coelce) registered 
the following results in 1999:
- net profit of R$ 74.9mn (R$ 27.72mn in 1998);
- net operational revenue of R$ 576mn (11.5% higher compared to 1998);
- net profit per 1,000 shares of R$ 0.48 (in 1998 it was of R$ 0.18);
The company explained the increase of its net operational revenue as a 
consequence of the increase of the electricity demand by 5.8% in Ceara and 
also as a consequence of the prices increase by 5.31%.

BRAZIL: ELETROBRAS TO ISSUE US$ 300MN EUROBONDS
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Brazilian state-owned electricity company Eletrobras confirmed that the 
company plans to issue US$ 300mn eurobonds in the beginning of April 2000.
The eurobonds will have 5 years term and will be issued in the US and in the 
European market in an operation led by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.

BRAZIL: NEW ALCOHOL TENDER
Gazeta Mercantil, 13 Mar 2000, p. b-20:-
 A new tender for the sale of 60mn litres of alcohol fuel will be held by the 
Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture on March 16th 2000 in order to avoid 
abusive alcohol prices increases.

BRAZIL: GASOLINE CONSUMPTION DECREASES
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. B-3:-
 The Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) informed that petrol 
consumption in Brazil decreased by 1%, or approximately 54,000 litres, in 
1999 compared to 1998.
According to the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), 
alcohol and petrol production decreased by 15.9% in January. IBGE explained 
this decrease as a result of the decrease of the demand.

BRAZIL: US$ 3.2BN INVESTMENTS FOR SANITATION
O Estado de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. b-2:-
 The Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) 
estimates that approximately US$ 3.2bn will be invested in the development of 
the Brazilian sanitation sector by 2010.

BRAZIL: BAD COLLECTION FOR SANITATION IN RIO 
Gazeta Mercantil, 06 Mar 2000, p. a-5:-
 According to the co-ordinator of the Depollution Program for the Guanabara 
Bay (Greater Rio de Janeiro region in Brazil), Renato Lima do Espirito Santo, 
the shortage of collection network does not allow the use of the full 
sanitation capacity in the Greater Rio de Janeiro region.
One example is that the Sewerage Treatment Stations (ETE) of Pavuna and 
Sarapui do not work, even with total capacity for 1 cubic metre/second, due 
to the lack of 700 kilometres of collection network.

ARGENTINA: LPG TAX OPPOSED
La Nacion (Argentina), 13 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 The tax imposed by the Argentine province of Buenos Aires on the initial 
sale of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) has been opposed by the sector chamber 
Cegla, on the grounds that it prejudices distributors of LPG in favour of 
natural gas, given that the tax will be used to subsidise the expansion of 
natural gas pipelines. The law was imposed in 1979.

ARGENTINA: OIL COMPANIES VS. GOV'T 
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 10:-
 The announcement by oil companies in Argentina last Friday, 10 March, that 
the recent drop in international crude prices would be reflected at the gas 
pump set off a new round of threats from the government. Argentina President, 
Fernando de la Rua, and his Economy Minister, both said they were prepared to 
battle the oil companies over prices. Meanwhile, the legislature is debating 
applying an export tax on oil, the funds from which would go to lowering 
consumer petrol taxes.

ARGENTINA: ENRON NEXT TO START LEGAL ACTION
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 2:-
 The US-based Enron Corp. could be the next company to take its case against 
Argentina to arbitration at the World Bank. Five other foreign firms have 
taken their cases to the World Bank, most of which are over differences with 
provincial governments. Enron, as well as Lancon International and Endesa, 
claim that taxes the provinces want to impose are unfair and were not part of 
concession and/or privatisation agreements. The French Compangnie Generale 
des Eaux is trying to claim damages when the north-western province of 
Tucuman cancelled its water services contract allegedly for serious errors. 
The oldest case is that of the firm, Eriday, which is claiming US$ 1.5bn owed 
by Argentina for its part in the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam. These cases are 
seen as one more negative legacy of the previous administration of Carlos 
Menem.

ARGENTINA: TO STAND FIRM ON YACYRETA ISSUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/7:-
 Argentina says that it will stand firm under any pressure to be applied by 
Henry Kissinger and his band of representatives from international companies 
to pay the some US$ 1.5bn due in budget overruns in the construction of the 
hydroelectric dam, Yacyreta. Eriday, the construction consortium, appointed 
Kissinger as its negotiator for its claims against the Argentine state. 
Officials in that country maintain they will review the claims one by one in 
an atmosphere of transparency, and for their part talk of amounts much less 
than those claimed by Eriday.

ARGENTINA: CAPEX RESULTS
Buenos Aires Economico, 13 Mar 2000, p. 18:-
 The Argentine energy company, Capex, reported earnings of US$ 11.6mn at the 
close of its intermediate balance on 3 January 2000, up by US$ 200,000 from 
the same period of a year earlier. Although net earnings were up, 
profitability was down considering that billing was up by 28%. 
Capex expects earnings to continue to increase especially now that the fourth 
line of the Comahue-Buenos Aires transmission line is working and the 
combined-cycle power plant in the western province of Neuquen is close to 
full operations.

BRAZIL: MEASURES TO COMBAT FUEL PRICES INCREASES
Folha de S.Paulo, 11 Mar 2000, p. 2-1:-
 The Brazilian government is studying some measures to avoid more increases 
in fuels prices, and one of this possible measures is to cancel subsides for 
the alcohol, and also to increase the prices of kerosene for aviation and LPG 
(Liquefied Petroleum Gas).
Allowing the increase of these prices, part of the oil import costs, which 
are included in gasoline prices, can be transferred to these other products 
and gasoline prices can be controlled.

ARGENTINA: PETROL MARKET SHAKE UP DUE
La Nacion (Argentina), 12 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The recent rises in petrol prices have caused new moves to be contemplated 
in Argentina to shake up the petrol market there. While many see government 
threats to control prices as empty, talk of opening up the market to other 
foreign oils imports and freeing up the petrol retail distribution chain is 
gaining ground. One idea circulating is to have supermarket chains act as 
sellers of foreign petrols. Oil companies remain firm in their stance that 
the reason petrol is so expensive in Argentina is because of taxes: 58% of 
the price at the pump.

Hi Delores

Matthias Lee, the legal counsel from Singapore will be in Houston during the 
week 3 - 7 April 2000.  Besides attending the Enron Law Conference on 5 - 7 
April, Matthias will be in the Houston office from 3 to 4 April (Monday & 
Tuesday) and he would like to drop by Sara Shackleton's office to say 
hello.   Could you please check Sara's schedule to see if Sara is free to see 
Matthias on the 3rd or the 4th?  

Thanks for your help.

Angeline
Assistant to Matthias Lee

Attached is a sample "format" for summarizing swap group activity.  Please 
add your own activities and feel free to edit the sample.  Suggestions are 
welcome.  I'll edit responses in time  for our meeting next week.  Thanks.  
Sara

Of course it works!  Had lunch just now with Carson Llewellyn.  He's in 
private practice in Houston and said things had slowed down a bit here.  Have 
a great weekend.  SS

   

Thought I would try this address as soon as I got home.. Hope it works.
Catch you later...

Please review and call me.

Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and 
introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful 
as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that "financial institutions" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

Give my regards to Pablo.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

attached is redrafted language which can "stand alone" or we can also 
incorporate the chart. (Jared, I think you have some prior language we can 
use, and we may have to rename one or two parts of the chart).  SS

OK, I have reviewed Lawhill  and AIG Funds.  Marie is making changes and the 
goal is to get blacklines of AIG to Rod today (since AIG has credit issues 
only).  The issues revolve around the Collateral Threshold and Letters fo 
Credit.  Lawhill will be ready for execution.  SS

Have you run your change past this guy or Morley?
Phil Morley asked me to follow up on the status of the ISDA Master.  I think
you have everything you needed from me--please let me know if I'm wrong.
Phil would like us to proceed with finalizing the form of the ISDA master
even if the pulp plant purchase is not scheduled until June.  I look forward
to hearing from you.  Thanks.

I have agreed, after much discussion with both Bradford and Per, that in the 
case of these two contracts only, we will agree to a collateral threshold of 
$0 for both ENA and the counterparty.  In addition, I have agreed to a 
rounding multiple of $250,000 and minimum transafer amount of $1.  Worksheet 
is attached.

Looks like nothing was ever done on this so I've contacted Tracy Ngo to move 
on a credit worksheet and then we can turn out a draft ASAP.  Do I need to 
call Holli?  Do you recall whether you and I had further discussions on 
this?  Sara

Sara,
Holli Krebs has asked for an update on the EWEB ISDA process.  EWEB means 
Eugene Water and Electricity Board           and is a small Oregon muni.   
She was under the impression that we had already sent an ISDA to EWEB but,  
she just got a call from Jim Deisen (the guy you and I met with at that  
Portland law firm---remember about a year ago?)  and Jim asked if we could 
send over our ISDA and schedule.    So.......   if we have already started 
down the path with EWEB, the West Desk would appreciate it if you could 
please  put it on top of the pile and follow up with Dieson (503-224-3092) 
or, if we have done nothing,  could you please give him a call and get the 
ball rolling on an ISDA.  Thanks very much and let me know if I can help in 
any way.----cgy

Gareth suggested that I forward these swap documents to you two.  We are 
working on a 125 "revolver" structure that allows for several 125 assets to 
use one Trust to complete transactions.  Each asset will be set up in its own 
Asset LLC and Transferor LLC, but the Total Return Swap will be with the 
Master Trust and a new confirmation will be issued for each asset as it is 
placed in the vehicle.  I will be out of town next week, so please let Gareth 
or Charles DeLacey (x35757) know if you have any questions or comments.  I 
will be available through tomorrow.  Thanks.

     RE:  Revised Form of Annex A

     Dear Mr. Sorenson:

     Your letter dated March 7, 2000 directed to the Cargill Legal
     Department regarding the above-referenced subject has been forwarded
     to me for attention.

     We are currently deeply involved in the negotiation of an ISDA Master
     As instructed in your letter, this is to advise that we do not accept
     the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation and prefer to
     continue to use ISDA's recommended standard long form Confirmation
     until the ISDA Master Agreement has been completed.  Any effort on
     your part to expedite the conclusion of these negotiations would be
     greatly appreciated.

     Regards,
     Marty Oelmann
     Documentation Analyst

     On an early conference call, Ian Schottlaender made the comment that in 
previous deals some of the banks have been confused by the termination 
provisions which were the first provisions in the Swap Schedule and, 
consequently, appeared on the front cover.  He asked if these provisions 
could be moved to a different part of the document and so were not 
conspicuous on the front cover.
     Accordingly, I swapped Part 1 of the Schedule with Part 5 of the 
Schedule.  Unfortunately, this meant that the CompareRite documents sent out 
earlier this week contained a lot of blacklined language, making it difficult 
to read Part 1 and Part 5.
     Attached to this e-mail is a blackline of the current Part 5 to the 
Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 1 of the Ghost Schedule, and the current 
Part 1 of the Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 5 of the Ghost Schedule.
     Please call me at 214-659-4414 if you have any questions or comments.

PLEASE DISREGARD THE DRAFT MEMO SENT ON 3/16/00.  I have reworked a new memo 
which prints on 3 pages and which I hope is brief and to the point.  Let's 
try to talk before Friday so that we can send the memo before then.  I still 
have not heard from Patricia Lopez.  SS

I have to leave the office at 10:30 to be at my home.  I should be back after 
lunch.  If you need to reach me, please feel free to call at (713) 664-3207.  
Thanks.  Sara

I gave the Kevin the OK and he was going to prepare a waiver letter.  Our 
conversation was some time ago.  Sara

Sara and Shari:
Could you please take a look at this and let me know waht you think?  Thanks.
Carol
Carol:  How are you?  I hope you are doing well.  I took a guess at your 
E-mail address based upon all of the others I have for your ENA Legal 
compatriots, so hopefully this will get through to your desktop.

One of my partners, Warren Ingber, has been asked to pick up on some work 
that Kevin Leitao was handling for Western Resources involving a  trading 
contract between ENA and Western Resources.  As I think you know, Kevin 
recently left us to take a position with GE Capital.  Warren asked me if the 
conflict waiver had been cleared with ENA and that is the reason for my 
E-mail.  Warren informed me that the draft that had been forwarded to him had 
indirectly come from Jeff Sorenson and that you were copied on the 
correspondence.

In a number of cases in the past involving these types of contracts, ENA has 
granted us waivers to represent the particular ENA counterparty.  I think the 
general consensus was that ENA would rather have us represent the 
counterparty, rather than another outside firm, since Kevin in particular had 
been working with various ENA lawyers on a number of the issues that 
frequently arise under these agreements and that it was more efficient (and 
beneficial to the overall transaction) to work with a firm that had 
familiarity both with respect to the issues as well as ENA's general views on 
them.  Also, it is my understanding that the provisions are somewhat well 
accepted and that it is unusual for there to be difficult legal 
negotiations.  I know that Kevin had from time to time cleared these 
representations on a case by case basis with the various ENA lawyers involved 
(for e.g., I know there were one or more transactions in which Shari and Sara 
were involved) and would let me know how we were proceeding.  My memory is 
failing me on this one, although I seem to recall that the conflict had been 
waived a while ago.  However, I just want to make sure that that was in fact 
done in this case.

Could you let me know if my recollection is accurate or if you foresee any 
problem in this respect.  Our contact at Western Resources said he understood 
the conflict matter had been dealt with a while ago.  Obviously, we do not 
want to take on a representation of this nature without ENA's consent.

I will be out of the office during the early part of the week, but I will be 
checking E-mail and voice mail regularly.  My phone number is 212 424-8125.  
Thanks again, Carol.

John

Gil,
I received my copy of the instructions to Morgan Stanley and the letter to 
the transfer agent.
I have faxed a copy to Frank Moy at Morgan Stanley who has not received the 
original,as yet.
I have requested his verification that the account is open and an anticipated 
timing for the transfer agent.

Have instructions been provided with the account opening authorizing John 
Greene to trade for Enron Communications Investments Corp?
Has Donna been provided with the necessary internal releases for the sale?
Are we anticipating only selling 2,392,058 in the near term since that is the 
only piece being registered in street-name?
John Greene will be provided with  instructions requesting him to sell and 
acceptable pricing guidelines.
 
Thanks Sheila

Instruction letter from ECIC to ECT Investments is waiting on  Mike Deville 
to fill in minimum trade price.I owe Donna documentation of necessary 
internal releases.  Donna--will you authorize on a verbal release and we can 
do paperwork later this week?  We are only anticipating selling the 2.3 
million, the remainder will be back in ECIC's name.

Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second 
"Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account 
which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of 
Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John 
Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my 
understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of 
this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar 
with this transaction.  Sara   

Pablo:  I am forwarding this message that I send to Patricia last week.  She 
may be out of town or otherwise engaged.  Would it be possible for you (or 
someone else in the firm) to respond to my two questions?  I only need a 
short explanation.  If you need to reach me, my telephone is (713) 853-5620 
and my fax is (713) 646-3490.  Thank you for your assistance.  Regards.  Sara

Patricia:  I can't thank you enough for arranging the many meetings and 
introductions for the Enron legal group.  Lynn and I are extremely grateful 
as it made our lives much easier and our jobs much more productive.  As 
always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom 
you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an 
internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently 
affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the 
following two items:

(1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not 
sure which it is) that "financial institutions" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on 
the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)

(2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to 
Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a 
local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master 
agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any 
transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by 
either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will 
be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the 
master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

Give my regards to Pablo.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

I received a message without further identification and I'm momentarily 
baffled.  Maybe the name rings a bell.  Thanks.  Sara

That will be fine (for the sole purpose of negotiating the ISDA).  Regards.  
Sara

Sara:  I am out of town, but receive thed enclosed response from Carol on 
this Western contract.  I assume that you are ok with LeBoeuf doing the work 
on this for Western.  If not, just let me know.  If it is ok with you, I will 
put together a very brief conflict waiver letter like we have done in the 
past.  Because I will be out of town the rest of this week, I might not be 
able to get it to you till the first part of next week, unless I can free 
up.  Let me know if that is any problem.  I hope all is well.  John

I checked with Sara about this and she mentioned that Kevin was supposed to
prepare a waiver letter to address this.  Could you please contact her at
853-5620?  I will be on vacation this week starting on Wednesday and given
your   schedule it might make sense to work this with Sara.  Thanks.

I'll send you a FedEX tonight with my seminar enclosures.  Thanks.  Sara

It was and my apologies.  Sara

Project Hawaii 125-0):
Project Ghost unwind
Project Spector (remaining Rhythms stock put into identical Ghost structure)
Project Hawaii 125-0 (permanent structure to handle FASB -125 deals)

Rod:  I believe you looked at Ghost last year.  Let me know if you have any 
Spector issues.
Bill and Rod:  I will send you summary terms for Project Hawaii 125-0.

Attached are summary documents.  I am in the process of reviewing the swap

Dow Jones Industrials          -40.64     -0.37%   10866.70

Tech stocks propelled the Nasdaq higher today as tech investors
put yesterday's interest rate hike from the Fed behind them.

Yesterday, the Fed raised two critical short-term interest rates
by 25 basis points (which equals 0.25%) each.  Today, Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made positive remarks concerning
the remarkable growth of the U.S. economy.  Greenspan attributed
much of the growth to the substantial increase in labor
productivity.  This is positive news to investors because to the
extent workers are more productive (due to technological
improvements), businesses produce more goods and services
without a commensurate increase in wages.  This, in turn,
suggests that wage inflation is being kept in check,
notwithstanding the nation's strong economic growth, which means
there is less of a reason to raise interest rates.

Large cap tech stocks were the driving force behind today's
rally.  Leading the way was Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO), up 3
33/64 (2.50%) to 144 3/8, Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL), up 3 3/8
(+4.18%) to 84 1/16, and America Online (NYSE:AOL), up 4 1/8
(+6.12%) to 71 1/2.  Other large non-tech movers today included
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), up 1 1/8 (+2.87%) to 40 5/16, General
Motors (NYSE:GM), up 1 9/16 (+1.95%) to 81 3/4, and Citigroup
(NYSE:C), up 13/16 (+1.40%) to 58 7/8.  On the downside, 3M
(NYSE:MMM) fell 4 7/16 (-4.91%) to 86, SBC Communications
(NYSE:SBC) dropped 2 (-4.42%) to 43 1/4, and Honeywell
(NYSE:HON) declined 3 3/4 (-7.50%) to 46 1/4.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares continued to impress today,
edging up 3/8 (+0.25%) to 150 7/8 on continuing announcement
from the conglomerate's announcement yesterday that its first
quarter earnings would come in "modestly" higher than expected.

The online and offline worlds came together today in another
cross-marketing alliance, this one between Pepsi-Cola (NYSE:PEP)
and Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO).  The companies announced a joint
online and offline promotional campaign called "Pepsi Stuff.com"
that will last 5 months beginning in August.  The program will
enable consumers to earn online awards and discounts from
promotions appearing under the caps of bottled Pepsi products.
A Yahoo! logo will also appear in close to 50,000 retail stores
nationwide where Pepsi products are sold.  Yahoo shares rose 5
7/16 (+2.84%) to 197 3/16 and Pepsi shares declined 13/16 (-
2.37%) to 33 1/2.

Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) led tech news today after
announcing an alliance aimed at establishing its position in the
burgeoning market for wireless handheld devices.  The software
giant will team with Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), the world's
largest developer of semiconductor chips for mobile devices, to
develop improved software for these devices, such as personal
digital assistants (PDAs).  Microsoft will use TI's digital
signal processors (DSPs) to enable its Windows CE operating
system that is used in wireless handheld devices.  Microsoft
shares edged up 1/2 (+0.49%) to 103 1/4.

First Union (NYSE:FTU) shares rose 13/16 (+2.26%) to 36 11/16
after the bank announced plans to build and launch an e-
marketplace for small and mid-sized companies in the third
quarter of 2000.  Among other things, the online service will
aggregate the buying power of participants to lower their
purchasing costs on a host of supplies, products, equipment and
services.  First Union has tapped privately held Intelisys
Electronic Commerce to help set up the service.

PSINet (Nasdaq:PSIX) was also in the news after announcing it
would acquire Metamor Worldwide (Nasdaq:MMWW), a business
software and services company, in a stock deal valued at $1.9
billion.  The move will help PSINet, an Internet access and
services provider, diversify into the e-commerce arena =0F-- as a
result of the deal, PSINet will also gain control over Metamor's
e-commerce software affiliate, Xpedior (Nasdaq:XPDR).  Metamor
shares soared 108.30% (up 17 21/64) to 33 21/64 on the news.
Xpedior shares also impressed, gaining 53.71% (up 7 11/16) to
22, while PSINet shares slipped 16.04% (down 7 15/16) to 41
9/16.

The chip sector performed well today, once again on the heels of
a gain from industry leader Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC), which
closed up 5 5/8 (+4.06%) to another all-time high of 144 1/16.
Meanwhile, Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) shares rallied today,
despite its announcement of lower than expected earnings
yesterday, after numerous brokerage firms came to the company's
defense today and offered positive comments.  Micron shares
surged 20 (+16.77%) to 139 1/4.  Rambus (Nasdaq:RMBS) shares,
which have fallen back in recent sessions, bounced back 31.43%
(up 83 51/64) to 350 3/8 today after a Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter analyst offered positive comments on the company and set
a price target of $500 per share.

Bio-tech stocks were again on the move today, this time to the
upside.  These stocks have been very volatile in recent weeks,
so today's big gains must be viewed in the context of overall
recent declines.  Nonetheless, Protein Design Labs (Nasdaq:PDLI)
gained 9 3/8 (+9.73%) to 105 11/16, Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq:HGSI) rose 14.55% (up 13 25/64) to 105 7/16, Affymetrix
(Nasdaq:AFFX) moved up 11 13/16 (+7.47%) to 169 7/8, and
Medimmune (Nasdaq:MEDI) added 15 13/16 (+9.92%) to 175 3/16.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors include:

<> Vignette (Nasdaq:VIGN), jumping 16.32% (up 32 19/64) to 230
15/64 on news the e-business applications provider will join
forces with Breakaway Solutions (Nasdaq:BWAY) to help companies
build successful e-businesses.

<> Microstrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR), bouncing back 22.71% (up 16
27/64) to 88 47/64 after plummeting the first two days of this
week after it announced it would re-state earnings for the last
2 years.

<> Wireless Facilities (Nasdaq:WFII), gaining 20.93% (up 19
29/32) to 115; Sciclone (Nasdaq:SCLN), jumping 52.61% (up 5
63/64) to 17 23/64; and Selectica (Nasdaq:SLTC), surging 58.09%
(up 43 23/32) to 118 63/64.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=3D"http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

Despite the underlying strength in the tech sector today, only
two companies made their public debut and with mixed results.
The big winner on the day was telecommunications chip component
maker inSilicon (Nasdaq:INSN), which surged 79.69%% to 21 9/16.
This company was highlighted in last week's Smat!IPO Report as a
likely winner.

The other IPO on the day -- that of PartsBase.com (Nasdaq:PRTS),
a provider of business-to-business (B2B) services in the airline
industry =0F-- did not perform as well.  The company's shares fell
12.50% to 11 3/8.

Although PartsBase.com did not soar like some of its leading B2B
predecessors, such as Comemrce One (Nasdaq:CMRC), Ariba
(Nasdaq:ARBA), or VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT), this doed not
necessarily signal a shift away from B2B stocks.  Rather, it is
due more to the recent flood of B2B IPOs.  These IPOs should be
judged on their individual merits -- promising ones could still
fly.  SmartPortfolio.Com will be watching.

There are many more very promising IPOs expected to start
trading later this week and next week.  For more information on
these and other upcoming IPOs, please visit

Attached is an updating memorandum addressing the impact of Argentine tax 
issues on our trading business in Argentina.

Please excuse the delay but I was hoping to deliver all of my information to 
you at once.  I am attaching our latest generic Schedule format.  You will 
see our "No Reliance" and "Limitation of Liability" provisions included.  
None of our confirmation templates contain non-reliance provisions (unless it 
is specifically added by an attorney for a particular Transaction).

Unfortunately, I  do not yet have an answer as to the existence of written 
guidelines or policy addressing the provision of  quotes to customers.  I 
will follow up when I have the response.

Please let me know if you need more information or if we need to conference.

Sara,

We are trying to pull together the resolutions, the legal opinions, and the 
guaranty or financials for the LP.

ours).

Thanks for your effort in the meantime.

Don, the ENA WTI swap which you booked for TBS needs to be rebooked into 
another entity which is totally controlled by Enron.  John Novak and I 
thought that perhaps the most appropriate entity would be Enron South America 
LLC.  Please confirm if this is the entity you want the trade booked with.  
If so, you will need to have John Mee prepare an amended deal ticket.  

Joe, can you confirm that Enron South America LLC is an eligible swap 
counterparty (1mm in net worth or 10mm in assets)?  

If anyone else has any questions, comments or issues please respond as 
quickly as possible.  This deal was closed on January 13 and needs to be 
documented.  

Thanks,
Brent  

As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC ("ESA") confirmation issue is 
draining our little brains.  Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort 
through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled.  
Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an 
inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.).  
Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.

Brent:  please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.  Sara

Mike:  I have not heard from since my prior message attached below.  Have you 
had a chance to consider our request? I look forward to hearing from you. 
Please email or call me at (713) 664-3207.  Regards.  Sara

1.  Friday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials                 -7.14     -0.06%   11112.72
S&P 500                         +0.11     +0.01%    1527.46
Nasdaq                         +22.42     +0.45%    4963.03
Internet Stock Index           +16.63     +1.56%    1080.27

A buying binge of Internet and technology stocks sparked Friday
morning's market rally, which led to solid gains on the Dow and
the Nasdaq throughout most of the day, before the Dow finished
lower amid profit-taking by investors, closing a week
characterized by strong performances on the major U.S. indexes
as investors temporarily put aside their concerns about future
interest rate hikes and upcoming quarterly earnings
announcements.

Friday's market action was kicked off by the Commerce
Department's report that new orders for durable goods, including
cars, computers and appliances that are intended to last three
years or more, fell 2.3% in February to $208.45 billion, which
was weaker than analysts' forecasts of a 0.2% decline.
February's numbers for orders of costly U.S. manufactured goods
represent the second month of declines in a row.  The report
came only a few days after the Federal Reserve hiked short-term
interest rates for the second time this year in its ongoing
determination to keep the steaming economy in check.

After boosting stocks on Thursday amid rumors that the mammoth
government antitrust lawsuit against it might be nearing
closure, Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) is expected to make a sweeping
offer to settle the case as the government eases up on demands
that the software titan be broken up.  If the proposal by
Microsoft is sufficiently wide ranging, then it could result in
final negotiations as early as this weekend among Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein
and Judge Richard Posner, who has been serving as the case's
mediator.  On the other hand, if the proposal is deemed to be
too narrow by prosecutors, it could destroy the settlement
negotiations and throw the case back into the courts.  A federal
judge ruled last year that Microsoft had abused monopoly power
in its Windows computer operating system, which allegedly harmed
consumers, customers and other companies.  Shares of Microsoft
dropped 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16.

Oil services companies had a strong day on Wall Street, as oil
prices rose on Friday in the wake of a final effort being made
by the U.S. government to persuade OPEC to agree to a big output
hike at next week's gathering of the group.  Halliburton
(NYSE:HAL) gained 7/8 (+2.31%) to 38 3/4, Schlumberger
(NYSE:SLB) closed up 7/8 (+1.13%) to 78 3/16, Transocean
Offshore (NYSE:RIG) rose 1 3/16 (+2.64%) to 46 3/16, Cooper
Cameron (NYSE:CAM) gained 2 1/8 (+3.28%) to 66 7/8, and Smith
International (NYSE:SII) closed up 1 7/8 (+2.50%) to 77.

The drug sector was buzzing over the statement by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) that Propulsid, a popular drug with
nearly $1 billion in sales last year, had been associated with
341 reports of heart rhythm abnormalities, including 80 reports
of deaths.  Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the maker of the
prescription heartburn drug, reported that it would stop
marketing the product in the U.S. and that it is working with
the FDA to create a special "limited access" program to keep it
available for certain patients that have not been helped by
other treatments.  Following the news, shares of Johnson &
Johnson plunged 10.78% (down 8 5/8) to 71 3/8, while shares of
other drug stocks also had weak performances, with Merck
(NYSE:MRK) dropping 1 1/8 (-1.79%) to 61 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
closing down 3/16 (-0.53%) to 35 1/16, Schering-Plough
(NYSE:SGP) falling 1 1/2 (-3.97%) to 36 1/4, Pharmacia & Upjohn
(NYSE:PNU) dropping 2 9/16 (-4.30%) to 57, American Home
Products (NYSE:AHP) closing down 1 1/2 (-2.77%) to 52 11/16, and
Warner-Lambert (NYSE:WLA) falling 15/16 (-1.00%) to 93 1/16.

The hotel and real estate industries converged on Friday as
MeriStar Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:MMH), which operates 235 lodging
properties, announced that it would acquire BridgeStreet
Accommodations (NYSE:BDS), which offers upscale furnished
apartments, townhouses and condominiums as an alternative to
traditional hotel rooms.  The deal is expected to result in
MeriStar's leading position in the market for providing
temporary housing for executives and business travelers.  Shares
of MeriStar inched up 1/16 (+2.27%) to 2 13/16, while shares of
BridgeStreet soared 29.03% (up 9/16) to 2 1/2.

The Nasdaq had another run up on Wall Street on Friday, leading
to more record highs for many Internet and technology stocks
during the day's trading session, including Adobe Systems
(Nasdaq:ADBE), which closed up 1 5/8 (+1.52%) to 108 3/16,
Xilinx (Nasdaq:XLNX), which dropped 1 3/4 (-2.07%) to 82 5/8,
and Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW), which closed up 2 11/16
(+2.75%) to 100 1/2.

Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) surpassed Microsoft as the biggest
company in the world during Friday's trading session, before
Microsoft regained that distinction in a late-day rally.  Shares
of Cisco closed up 1 9/16 (+2.01%) to 79 3/8, representing a
market cap of $550.7 billion, while shares of Microsoft closed
down 3/16 (-0.17%) to 111 11/16, representing a market cap of
$581.3 billion.

In leading Internet stock news, the Financial Times reported on
Friday that Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) and online auctioneer eBay
(Nasdaq:EBAY) have resumed the merger talks that had collapsed
earlier this month.  In early March, analysts noted several
strategic benefits that would be derived from a Yahoo-eBay
alliance, but indicated that an acquisition of eBay would be
extremely expensive for Yahoo.  Moreover, questions were raised
with respect to why eBay would desire to sell out at a time when
its business is thriving.  Shares of Yahoo rose 3 (+1.57%) to
194, while shares of eBay jumped 20 3/16 (+9.03%) to 243 3/4.

Business-to-business (B2B) news was topped by reports that four
major players in the aerospace and defense industry are joining
forces to create an online marketplace with B2B powerhouse
Commerce One (Nasdaq:CMRC).  The joint venture, which includes
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTNa), Boeing
(NYSE:BA) and British Aerospace, is being designed to bring
together buyers and suppliers in the industry, allowing them to
buy and sell parts and conduct business over the Internet.
Following the news, shares of Commerce One jumped 18 11/16
(+9.12%) to 223 11/16, while shares of other B2B players
finished the day with mixed results as E.piphany (Nasdaq:EPNY)
closed up 6 1/2 (+3.80%) to 177 1/2 and Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL)
gained 1/8 (+0.14%) to 87, while Ariba (Nasdaq:ARBA) dropped 5
15/16 (-2.24%) to 259 9/16, VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) fell 6
9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8 and VerticalNet (Nasdaq:VERT) closed
down 6 9/64 (-3.23%) to 183 7/8.

The B2B announcement was the latest in a wave of moves by
leading companies in various industries to create online
marketplaces.  It wasn't even the first such deal in the
aerospace and defense industry -- last month, United
Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and i2
Technologies (Nasdaq:ITWO) announced plans to launch
MyAircraft.com, an electronic marketplace for aerospace products
and services for approximately 25,000 buyers and sellers.  In a
separate transaction, General Electric (NYSE:GE) recently
created a new online exchange that will allow major airlines to
buy and sell parts via the Internet.  B2B marketplaces also have
sprung up in such industries as chemicals, automobile
manufacturing, construction and pharmaceuticals, as companies
increasingly are seeking to move their supply chains into
cyberspace to reduce the paperwork and time involved in
purchasing, manufacturing and inventory.

The online brokerage sector had a strong day on Wall Street
following the statement by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray that it
was raising its revenue forecasts for online brokerage giants
Ameritrade Holding (Nasdaq:AMTD) and E*Trade Group (Nasdaq:EGRP)
as a result of recent unprecedented trading volumes.  Shares of
Ameritrade gained 2 5/16 (+10.54%) to 24 1/4, shares of E*Trade
rose 4 1/8 (+14.80%) to 32, while shares of other online
brokerage firms also performed well on the day, with National
Discount Brokers Group (NYSE:NDB) rising 5 5/8 (+11.07%) to 56
7/16, Siebert Financial (Nasdaq:SIEB) gaining 1 9/16 (+11.26%)
to 15 7/16, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCH) closing up 3 3/8 (+5.51%)
to 64 5/8, Knight/Trimark Group (Nasdaq:NITE) rising 6 5/16
(+11.97%) to 59 1/16, and DLJ Direct (NYSE:DIR) gaining 1 7/16
(+10.04%) to 15 3/4.

Other Internet and technology stock movers included:

<> GoTo.com (Nasdaq:GOTO), which surged 33.17% (up 11 63/64) to
48 7/64 after the Internet search engine company announced on
Friday that it logged more than 2 million unique visitors during
March 2000 and expanded the number of paying advertisers to more
than 25,000.

<> Xircom (Nasdaq:XIRC), which fell 10.21% (down 4 3/16) to 36
13/16 after the maker of products that connect portable personal
computers to telephone systems, networks and the Internet
reported that its quarterly earnings would not meet Wall Street
expectations.

<> Wit Capital Group (Nasdaq:WITC), the parent of online
investment banking group Wit Soundview, which jumped 29.43% (up
4 7/8) to 21 7/16 after reporting that its first quarter
financial results likely will exceed analysts' forecasts.

<> Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), which fell 1 5/16 (-4.39%) to 28
9/16 on very heavy volume based largely on concerns that the
computer company's first quarter earnings may fall short of
estimates as a slowdown in corporate spending on PCs during the
first quarter might create a revenue shortfall.

<> Teledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY), which jumped 14.68% (up 2)
to 15 5/8 on continued momentum from Wednesday's announcement by
the leading provider of sophisticated electronic and
communications products that it has reached an agreement with
Lockheed Martin to supply turbine engines for the Joint Air-to-
Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) program.

<> Power Integrations (Nasdaq:POWI), which sank 39.97% (down 19
11/16) to 29 9/16 one day after the circuit maker reported that
it expects its first quarter revenues to fall below
expectations.

6. IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF="http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

The action in the market today demonstrated how not all IPOs --
even those tech-related -- are created equal.  Investors recent
love affair with communication/semiconductor stocks continued as
Silicon Laboratories (NASAQ:SLAB), a maker of mixed-signal
integrated circuits, bolted 123.79%.  In contrast however,
eMachines (NASDAQ:EEEE), a maker of low-cost computers, fell
8.33%.  eMachines is an interesting story because it actually is
one of the leading PC manufacturers in terms of total PCs
shipped.  Its low-cost model, however, clearly did not sit well
with investors.

Looking ahead to the next few weeks, the IPO pipeline is still
stacked.  While there are still many quality IPOs expected to
come to market, the glut of IPOs will make the top issues
slightly more difficult to find.  Investors are increasingly
scrutinizing business-to-business- and Internet infrastructure-
related issues just as they started to with business-to-consumer
Internet issues when supply became to much.

outperform, please visit http://www.smartportfolio.com/freetrial

Please, send me your updated report today, not later than 5:00 p.m.
Thanks,

I spoke with Chris Littlefield (legal) a few moments ago and he would like 
for you to call Dial's treasury person, Dave Riddiford.  Dial really wants an 
explanation of how/why all numbers were selected for inclusion in the 
Schedule and CSA, including:

(1)  3rd p. D/F Threshold Amount
(2) whether Credit Event Upon Merger can be tied to ratings downgrade (I 
explained the MAC trigger)
(3) Collateral Threshold  (and, by the way, Chris says that he never 
understood that Dial would ever have to post)
(4) Min. Transfer/Rounding

Not too bad.  Call me if you have any questions.  From the legal perspective, 
I have only to resolve recording and arbitration.  Thanks.  Sara

Dale Neuner on 07/01/99 08:26:51 AM
I am tied up in reviews for at least 4 hours today, and will be leaving 
tomorrow at about 2 o'clock to start my two-week vacation. Starting 
immediately, please send all correspondence, questions or requests to Lucy 
Ortiz. I have handed off all open items to her (with the exception of the 
remaining National Gypsum Company trade), including the trades that came down 
yesterday. 

Melba returns on Monday and will resume her role documenting Confirmations. 
In my absence, Lucy will assume my role of review/additional support, and 
will coordinate any new issues, language, etc. with Sara Shackleton.

As with myself, please realize that Lucy wears many hats, and extend to her 
the same patience and understanding that you give me.

Attached are comments to the Schedule but not the CSA. 
Russell:  Have you had any conversations with FP&L credit?
Sara:  Enclosed are clean and marked copies of a revised schedule for
the proposed ISDA master agreement between Enron and FP&L.  I have
only reviewed and commented at this time on the master agreement's
schedule itself (I have left the credit support annex attached within
the same document, as you sent it, but have not yet reviewed or
commented on it, so ignore it for now).  I have reviewed many such
schedules and found your form to be quite good (as you may know, those
of some large market-makers are not so good, so please don't take this
as patronizing; it's a sincere compliment).  Hopefully you will find
the revisions equally acceptable.  I look forward to your comments or
approval.  Regards, -Serge

As requested.......Regina
      Attached for your review are (i) an execution copy of the Assignment
of Membership Interest, (ii) a draft of the Swap Termination Agreement, and
(iii) a draft of the Guaranty Termination Agreement.

 I told Michelle Vonderhaar that we would e-mail to her copies of the
Termination Agreements after you have had a chance to review them.  Please
let me know when you would like me to send them to her.  Michelle also
indicated that it would probably take a couple of days to locate someone who
is able to sign on behalf of Bankers Trust International PLC, which means
that we will have to execute those documents as of a date after March 28,
2000.

 Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions.

Hello everyone,

Hope you have had a wonderful week thus far.  I have attached the revised 
confirm for ESA LLC, but before a signature is applied, I would like to get 
an okay from you.  I spoke to Sara, and she said that we were working on 
getting Jana Morse as an approved signer for ESA.

Have a great day!

Sheetal :)

Deborah:  I understand that an EES asset is going into an asset trust for 
Hawaii 125-0 and that ENE wants a back-to-back swap with EES.  Is EES the 
swap counterparty?  Sara

"wedding list" and I don't have your address in
Houston.  Can you Please email it to me.  Also, I am

Sara,

Greetings!!!  Thanks for joining us again. I'm sure we'll have a blast and 
yes let's get together so I can update you on our organization.

 I have attached a memo from our guy in Australia who just started in 
January.  Please address his needs and let me know what the status of his 
requests are in a couple of days.  Shane's office number is 011 61 2 9229 
2412.

Paul S. called you because a London group thought they had the ok from Paul 
to trade financials in the UK.  I simply asked him what the difference was 
between that group and mine with respect to Enron's UK regulatory status.

Regards,

Gary

Shane Dallmann

Gary,

I haven't been able to get a hold of you the last couple of days and there 
are a
few things I wanted to discuss.

1. If you don't have a problem I am proposing to put in place an execution
agreement with ABN Amro Futures who will give up to Commonwealth Bank on 
behalf
of Carr. I have already put the steps in motion for this to occur through 
Shari
Stack.

2. I would like to put in place an ISDA between ENA and Commonwealth Bank as I
have been talking to their FX desk and would like to be in the position of 
being
able to trade with them. I will talk to Credit about it if you don't have a
problem.

3. The laywer here told me the other day that we have not signed an ISDA with
Westpac because of a disagreement over guarantees. Apparently Westpac have 
been
hard to deal with through the whole process although all other issues have 
been
signed off. When the FX contact came here for a meeting yesterday I told him
that I wouldn't be dealing with them until the ISDA was sorted out and he said
that Houston is dealing without an ISDA so I should. My concern is that while 
we
are dealing with them there is no pressure on them to sort out the ISDA.

I sent a book to Clara about Australian financial markets and included in the
package a surf lifesaving cap because I had heard you wanted one. It is the
competition cap of Memaid Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.

Everything else is going fine

Regards,

Shane

David,

I am sending you lastest Pulp & Paper disclaimer per Sara Shackleton's 
request.

 Kaye

David,

I am sending you the latest Pulp & Paper disclaimer per Sara Shackleton's 
request.

 Kaye

I will need to leave the office at approximately 5 pm.  Sara

Close.  Credit is considering credit terms for the deal.  If executed today, 
we'll have to do a Deemed ISDA and simultaneously send out a draft ISDA for 
negotiation.  Do you have a deal ticket already?  I understand it's a 7-year 
deal.  SS

Laurel Adams

Sara,

Pushkar is in the process of doing an Interest Rate Swap with EMP Echo LLC.  
The deal has been approved by credit already.  Davis Thames is involved in 
the transaction and can give you the name of the attorney who is representing 
Echo.  Davis was thinking that his attorney (Gerald something) would prepare 
an ISDA and send it to you to put a Master Agreement in place.  Let me know 
what I need to do, as I will be waiting to find out what form of confirmation 
to use for the transaction.  Thank you very much for your help.

Thanks for your help!  I'll let you know what I learn.  SS

Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment.

Please print for David.  Thanks.

Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment.

Attached is the language which should replace (i) in the Additional 
Provisions.  Also, in your part (ii) [now part (iii)], the words "Fixed 
Price" should be capitalized each time used.  Also, you should add the 
following sentence to numbered paragraph "1" on the first page:  "Capitalized 
terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned 
to said terms in the Agreement."

Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you 
were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. 
Also, let's have lunch.  Sara 

Sara and Gareth,

We still need to finish this agreement and have it signed.  To my knowledge, 
it has not been completed and signed.

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

Is there a call in the morning?  Everyone will be in Houston.  Sara

Elizabeth Serralheiro@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
04/03/2000 08:50 AM
Please send me  your updated report today, not later than 5:00 p.m. 

Due to the Daylight Savings Time in the U.S. the above conf. call  for the 
ones in Houston, the time has changed to 8:00 a.m. and will remain at 10:00 
a.m. Brazil/Argentine Time.

Regards,
Elizabeth.

(1)  The term "Threshold Amount" as used in Annex B refers to the threshold 
for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by 
reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., 
"Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets 
the threshold level and we input that number into the document.

(2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her 
number is X34737.

SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara

   

Laurel,

As we discussed on the phone, the floating rate day count convention should 
be Actual/360.

Sara, could you easily explain what the Threshold Amount means in Annex B?  I 
tried to look it up on the web but couldn't find anything.  Additionally, if 
you have an extra copy of ISDA up there, I might like to have a copy (hope 
you don't hurt yourself laughing...).

Thanks & regards,
Davis

 Please find attached a draft of the confirmation for the interest rate 
swap.  Please review and let me know what changes may need to be made.  Sara, 
please pay speical attention to the Fixed and Floating rate payer payment 
dates, and the floating rate option language.  

You'll handle?

Susan,

Can you forward this to the appropriate legal person:

BP Amoco Corporation - still marks up Annex A, Setoff paragraph so that the 
word "derivative" is added (see attached - change in red, Section 5) We have 
recieved prior approval to "Execute" the EOL deals in which this change is 
made, but not the non-EOL deals.  Is this still correct?

Aquila Canada Corp. - marks up Annex A as attached (see markups in red)  (All 
are EOL deals)

Sorry I can't help.
Also, you know that legal will be out of the office from Wed. afternoon 
through the end of the week.  Are there any pressing items?  Sara

Laurel Adams

I faxed the final confirmation to Patti Melcher at Echo yesterday.  In order 
to get the counterparty set up in Global, I need something on EMP Echo 
letterhead.  Does anyone have anything that they could fax to me, that 
indicates the full company name, address, and maybe even bank instructions?  
( I know--I'm asking for a lot!)  Thanks very much for your help.

Am reviewing now.  SS

Just touching base with you re this one.  Any comments to the documents I 
sent to you last week?  We are supposed to talk to WestLB again tomorrow and 
hope to wrap things up with them.  Thanks and hope you are enjoying the 
holiday weekend.

take care,

Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on 
to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the 
outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:

(1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 
5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]

(2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ 
through 4/29/11]

(3)  Currency Swap between "ECT" and "Sutton Bridge" booked 3/29/00 [ through 
3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.

I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending 
Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there 
others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know 
anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and 
payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio 
tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara (X35620)

Jarrod:  that language works fine.  Sara

   

For a deal with Southern they would like to amend the true up period to be 90 
days. 

This is some language we used on an older deal under Special Provisions:

For purposes of this Transaction, the phrase "within 30 calendar days" in 
line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the 
phrase "within 90 calendar days."

Is it O.K. to use this again.

Also, I need to have your respose to Statoil which I left on your voice mail.
And, further, are you looking into Deutsche Bank? 

I'll be checking voice mail while I'm in San Antonio.  I gave the credit 
group in Houston Thursday and Friday off.  Sara

I'm working on it.  Sara

"Following Business Day Convention" means the convention for adjusting any 
relevant date if it falls on a day that is not a Business Day (when 
commercial banks settle payments is USD in N.Y., for our purposes) to the 
first following day that is a Business Day or a trading day for the relevant 
floating price source.  I hope I have given you a simple description.  

   

Sara,

Patti Melcher, ENA's counterparty in the swap, called to ask me for a 
definition of the "Following Business Day Convention" referenced on page 2 of 
her confirmation.  I had not received my copy of ISDA yet, and so could not 
answer the question.  Would you mind forwarding back to both of us?

Thanks & regards,

It is on Thursday April 27th this year. I wanted to go ahead and start

outstandingly well this past year (surprise, surprise...) .  I have

flowers and/or lunch for her. 

Please email me back by the end of the week if you want to participate in:

Also - I am open to suggestions on the lunch place. Anybody have a 
suggestion??   Some that I would propose are:  Mark's, Ruggles, Crostini, 
Boulevard Bistrot. 

I know they approved the opinion but it is redundant.  I'll show you what I 
think should be changed.  SS

of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional

As you may know, Project Ghost was unwound eff. 3/31/00.  I believe that 
Project MacArthur was also unwound. (but I haven't seen anything).  Also, 
Project Blackbird is in the process of being unwound.  Each will have a Swap 
Termination Agreement.  Brenda Funk should be organizing closing docs.  
Please make necessary entries on Lotus Notes and keep supporting 
documentation in the files.  I don't see Projects Ghost, Spector or Hawaii on 
Lotus Notes (these show up on your status of files list to Mark.  Thanks and 
let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Bob:  I haven't commented on preferred guaranty formats, I only asked Kris to 
fax the form of guaranty which Ed Wood had sent originally.  I thought that 
the e-mailed guaranty was the same as Ed Wood had distributed but I hadn't 
verified that item prior to sending.  I have not had a chance to review 
Kris's fax   If you have your own form, please send and we can review.  Sara

Robert.Aicher@kmz.com on 04/12/2000 11:54:27 AM
Sara, I received your e-mail yesterday and was unsure whether the form of
guaranty you attached was the correct form. I understand you talked to Kris
and agreed that the original form distributed was not the preferred
document. Was the attached guaranty another copy of the first form of
guaranty distributed, or is the updated version?

Julia:  To close the loop, it appears that none of the swaps were 
terminated.  Sara

Kris will not be on the call. I would like to see what points we can
resolve before we resort to the business people. Thanks.

Has this ever been finalized?

Taffy told me that Susan's husband had court this morning so she is late.  Is 
this weird or am I weird?  Sara

I am still waiting to hear whether ENA will transact with [Soc Gen] today (or 
whether Enron Australia will document its first weather trade).  SS

Attached is a suggested form of opinion.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Sara

Raymond can we discuss. 

(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?

Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 

One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,

We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.

Premium approx 700k AUD.

What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.

(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?

(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?

(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)

or any other suggestions ???

Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond

Christian & I are at EB level 32, you can call us on x 33238 c/o  Lucy Ortiz. 
I am Hyatt room 2726.

thx very much to David & Heidi for the prompt reply,
looking like have  ENA transact with say SG usa,
then for the portion of Sydney risk, En Aust transacts with ENA
for same % of premium & risk.

Thx,  Raymond  12 april

I am meeting with Susan Musch (APACHI's tax expert) and we will get back to 
you on the tax issues. Immediately I can tell you that back to back deals 
(with no spread) will not work. This raises transfer pricing issues. If the 
deal is SocGen on Melbourne temperatures, why is the counterparty not SocGen 
Aust? Is the deal pure trading, or is it being done to hedge a real exposure 
for Soc Gen. If the deal is being treated in any way as 'insurance' there can 
be issues with the cross border nature. 

I am in 2014 in 3AC if you are around and want to chat about it tonight.

ENA has a multibranch ISDA master with Soc Gen.  SS

After "Written Confirmation of Notice of Exercise", add the following:

"Seller's facsimile number for purposes of giving 
notice:"                      [we need a person and fax number because the 
master refers only to 'President" and

Hi Nancy!  I left a voice mail for you in Sao Paulo since Lynn told me you 
were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm.

Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
SFC compliance officer to kick off.

In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  

A.
Payment Date(s)

want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
days after end of 95 days.
Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.

B.
in Floating amount for 
time, and tighter defn of temperature
and base temp is 18

C.
Data Sources
I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
is not updated when a correction occurs)
but rather the final
Data Source is  "daily temp and climate archive" of the National
climate centre ( NCC) of BoM

Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
directly with Sara ?
Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?

Thx, Raymond

Paul,
as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
help them with an interimsolution on this contract.

Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 

I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!

comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
for public access. Is the website reference OK?

Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.

tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater

in whole but not in part, to any Affiliate so long as the obligations of such 
Affiliate are guaranteed by Enron Corp. pursuant to a guaranty substantially 
similar to the one provided on behalf of Party A, provided that such transfer

The Confidentiality and subsequent Consulting agreement are between ENA and 
Dr. Michael S. Haigh.
His phone # is 409-845-5819 and fax # 409-862-3019.

I would prefer documents sent to me and I will forward on to Dr. Haigh.

Thank you,  Elsa Piekielniak (x37613)

Attached is an updated list of issues based upon our meeting of July 2, 1999.

Yes, we're working on the master swap.  Actually, Ed Sacks, our new power 
member, is working on EWEB.  Legal should be getting a cws very shortly.

Thanks,
Tracy

Have you ever sent a credit worksheet for EWEB?  Holli Krebbs requested this 
again in mid-March.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

You are correct on both fronts. "Enron Power Holdings" is, I believe, an 
error.

Please ADVISE if "European Power Holdings" is the correct legal entity for 
closing out the FX piece of Sutton Bridge and if Maroon Aboudy is the party 
to whom a confirm should be directed.  Thanks.  SS

Sara, somehow your name got dropped when I sent this message.  Please let me 
know what you think.

Sara et al.,

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange 
deal with the parent company--European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form 
of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the 
appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?  
Thank you.

Jeff:  Per my voice mail, please let me know if Friday, May 12 is an 
acceptable date for your group.  This works fine for Settlements.  Thanks.  
Sara

regularly scheduled meeting at that time.  Sara

Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo 
regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.  I would like 
to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since 
they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time.  
I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times.  
Thanks.  Sara

Marie is updating her list and preparing a general memorandum in connection 
with the brokerage and futures agreements.  I have the following times 
available to meet (and I think we should schedule about an hour):

Thursday between 1:30 and 3:15
Friday   after 10 am

Please let me know as soon as possible of your preference and I'll try to 
accommodate everyone.  Thanks.  Sara 

Tanya will come to my office at 1:30 to discuss revision of the worksheet.  
Hope you can make it!  SS

Please invite the swap, confirmation, settlements groups.  The topic will be 
"an overview of the swap documentation process" and there are lots of new 
faces in all  Please ask participants to submit any issues they would like 
addressed, including specific confirmation or settlement issues.

Mark:  I left you voice mail last week regarding a due authorization opinion 
from ENA to Statoil (for execution of a master).  Will you or Haedicke sign?

Also, who signs an enforceability opinion (under either NY or Texas law)?

Thanks.  Sara

Of course I received this except that it arrived at 9:40pm last night.  The 
mansion was FAB! and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to 
Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.  I am currently into Danish 
modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I 
know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was 
outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems 
(which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with 
Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw "Run, Lola, Run" which 
is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother 
how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she 
could check her stock portfolio periodically.  I spoke with Daddy this 
morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME 
when you get this message.  Sass

   

Dear Sass,

Did you go to Dallas?  Did you have fun in Dallas?  How was your July 4?
Zachary called yesterday from his trip out of camp.  He told me that his
counselor has stolen a bunch of his clothes.  I'm not sure if I believe
him.  I think he may have just lost everything.

Let me know if you get this.

I miss you.

Debba

Per my voice mail.  I think Suzanne already reserved a room.

Irena let me know.

Thanks

Dawne,

I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June 
deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration.  
If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  

Thanks,

Errol

We got Irena a day at the spa during the week.  And for those of you that are 
here on Friday,  I would like to take her to lunch as well.

Let me know if you are coming.

I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate 
Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not 
officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put 
together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every 
book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these 
problems can be fixed before the morning.

The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.

Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,

Errol L. McLaughlin

Attached is a forwards detail of a Sithe deal from 1993.  It is an annuity 
totalling $234MM.  Let me know if this is the deal you were looking for.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Frank,

I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.

Thanks,

I will book this tonight.

Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last 
night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor 
behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all 
drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A 
few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the 
alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  

I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left  
Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.

See you soon,

E.L.M.

I'm sorry I will not be able to attend.

How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember 
anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot 
that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and 
was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 
minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember 
picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm 
so sorry!).

Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.

Let me know if you get three files -- one for each subsidiary.  That was the 
only way I could send them out.

Errol

Vikas,

Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
appropriate format.

Jim,

I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
settle down.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Homer,

I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
Email.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Done.

Jim,

 Thanks a lot for great basket - I just got it.  We'll call on Monday.

Errol

The basis curves corresponding to deals listed are saved in O:\ Dropbox 
\Errol\natsourcebasiscurves.  I.T. is still working on a fix for the Gas 
Daily curves.  I will let you know when we have something from them.  I let 
them know this was a time sensitive issue.

Thanks,

Everything looks correct, except for Friday, November 23, 2001.  Truong had 
this day listed as a holiday.  It is not a holiday -- the exchange will close 
early at 12 noon CST.

Please find attached the file that Dawn sent to me.  Sorry for the delay.  
Next month I'll be more prepared.

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Vikas

I finally got through to your fax at 11:00 am Houston time.  Please call me 
at 713-345-8274 if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Agustin,

Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is 
selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received 
a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and 
basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly

Thanks for your help on this.

Hi guys,

I took the liberty of looking in the NG-PRICE book to see if any deals were 
missed,
and came across a lot.  Here are the deals that need to be flipped to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before 2:00pm Houston time as I need to get invoices
off to the customers today.

There are about 40 other deals in this book that still need to be dealt with 
for January
settlement, but these ones need to be fixed right away.  I've left a phone 
message with
Laura, but haven't heard back yet, and I think that Sherry is still out of 
the office as she
hasn't changed her outgoing message to say that she's in the office.

If there are any problems with this message, please let me know.

Thanks for all your help

I will continue to run the financial risk desk.

I will be running the power options desk with UBS. I will still be trading gas though. how about you ?

I will take a look at it and let you know ASAP.

Errol,

We think that we have discovered an error in the system.  Elena has been valuing the San Diego Gas & Electric position.  It looks as if the mid for Dec 01 NGI Socal is in the system as $-.046.  The actual index however was $2.27.  Could you or someone in your group pls look into this and let us know asap.  We need to value this deal correctly so that we can unwind it.

John,

After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.

Thanks,

Errol

I will be there.

Heather,

Can you do me a favor.  The Reward Bucks application I filled out, was for Michelle Nelson.  I will be out all of next week.  If you get it next week can you have it sent to her.  She sits behind me at 3249B.  Her extension is X5-8091.

I have officialized the 14378 and unofficialized 14370.

Thanks,

Kori, Errol --

After speaking with Enpower IT, I was informed there were 2 calcs performed for Lavo's power books yesterday.

14370 - 4:11 PM (officialized)
14378 - 4:17 PM (not officialized)

14370 didn't have the positions, therefore, nothing is being picked up in RiskTrac. 14378 had the positions, but it was not saved as officialized, so RiskTrac is not picking it up as well.

We need to have 14378 saved as official so RiskTrac can pick up the positions.
Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks.

There is an excel queries file out there too.  I moved the files I use so if there is anything else you need please move it.  Greg will be helping us with the million different forwards details we have to get one for financial and one for physical that have everything we need.  The copy post-id macro is also in there.

KK

I think we should also put the position report file in there that Jad/Couch created as a backup to the CEPos/East Positions.  Couch can you put the query file you set up for the price desk?
PL

Jeff was able to create a Netco file under O:\erms\erms_adm without an erequest.  There is a file for each region out there now.  I will save the new p&l to each region but could each of you please pick an p&l from your region as a back-up just in case. 

these are the files I know of

Exotica
P&L
Hedgestrips
All excel queries
Weapon-X & new version
Access financial reports
Exotics file

Do you guys have anything else?

I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.

Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.

Thanks,

Errol

I actually wanted to discuss what opportunities are open in your area, as well.  I'd prefer to discuss this, for now, with just yourself.  Meliza had actually mentioned it earlier , that I should talk with you, so maybe we can casually discuss it during lunch.  I know that being in your area is quite demanding on your personal time, and I have 2 year old.  But I have strong background and I am just curious as to what else is out there.  This group is ok, but I am not being fully utilized.  I will attach my resume, for your review.

Thanks again for agreeing to sit me with.  It's getting pretty tight around here!!!

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.

Eric,

Leg B has already terminated (06/30/1999), and legs 9 and C are in Canadian books.  I left a message w/ book admins in Canada.  As soon as they get w/ me I'll run a minibook for you on those 2 deals.

Errol

Thanks man, however, I think we are missing leg 9, B, C on the JP swaps.  Could you re-run and send back?

I would really appreciate it.

Eric

 << File: EBOYTForwards.xls >> 

Errol,

Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from Jeremy or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?

Thanks

There is no deal in system for a Cal `02 swap.  Can you give me details on the deal (when done, price, vol., etc.)?

Thanks,

Errol

THE POWER INVENTORY AND THE LISTING OF PJM TRANSACTIONS DO NOT SHOW A CAL02 SWAP, HOWEVER I HAVE A CAL02 IN MY SPREADSHEET. CAN YOU CHECK THE INVENTORY AND MAKE SURE IT IS CORRECT/UPDATED. ALSO, CAN YOU CLEAN UP THE INVENTORY SHEET TOWARDS THE FRONT BY REMOVINGTHE EXPIRED CONTRACTS AND THE ZERO POSITIONS.

Anyone going?

A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

Jeff,

The day after Thanksgiving is NXB4.  We (Price-Desk) have some special procedures we have to follow regarding swaption expiration.  Other than that, it should not be that different from a non-bidweeek day.  I apologize, I thought the 23rd was going to be NXB3.

In December, the day after Christmas (Wednesday) is NXB2 and the Friday before that is NXB3.  Monday and Tuesday are exchange holidays.

Thanks,

I've been doing the meeting circuit again this morning, so that has kept me lively.  The post lunch period when things are quiet is going to be brutal though.

I agree w/ this position (67,016 Peak) as of last night.

Hi Errol, 

We're trying to generate our executive reports for Power positions from EnPower directly (trying to avoid using multiple spreadsheets). For the Financial group's power positions, I'm using the GASPOW portfolio in Enpower. For effective date 10/24, the query returned the numbers below for Peak and Off-Peak, respectively. Please confirm that these are correct and that these numbers capture all of your traders' positions.

Thanks.

what is this?

Errol,

Do you know if the trade below Frank is talking about was booked to NGI-Malin or to another curve.  His concern is that there isn't a volatility curve set and the P&L/Positions may be off.  

KK

Bharat was digging around in ERMS and noticed that NGI-Malin is missing a vol curve.. 
The immediate concern was gas VAR, and think I'm, okay given below?
The second concern is Larry May.
Larry booked $8MM last week on SoCal option trade.  The question I have is where is his vol curve?  How can he book $8MM when he isn't even posting a vol curve for Malin?was his trade elsewhere
Can you all noodle around for me?
Thanks
Frank

Frank,

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Regards,

Winston

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
Thanks
Frank

Kam,

Did Brad answer your question?  I've been in NYMEX hell all day and I am not up on this issue.  Let me know if I can help further.

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Regards,

Winston

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
Thanks
Frank

Yes, I ran his book for a while when he was head of the gas floor.  I've done some other projects for him.  Hope the e-mail wasn't too bad.

Errol

I accidentally sent an email to Jeff Shankman.  Do you know him?

Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.  Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.

We have a request from AA.  I listed the books involved in this attachment.  I have asked Kim Theriot group to provide some of the confirmation information or whatever they can get us.  

We need:
deal tickets
print out of curve strip (curve fetch)

new deal forward detail

Per Jeff we need to get this back to them today.

You can drop me off a copy of your deals and I'll coordinate with AA.

Thanks

Kam

   counterparty, executed)
   Contract

Kam,

Did we get everything take care of for you?

EM

Kori,

Can you get w/ Stephen & find out what's going on w/ this.

EM

Errol,

The Canadian Gas Daily that Kori does for Lavo is off between the hedgestrip and GERMS.  Germs is showing just about double what the hedgestrip is showing, 54.8 to 27.5.  I'm going with the GERMS please let Kori know if you can reach her.  

SP

Tom,

The GasPow position is correct.

Thanks,
Errol

All, the numbers below are from EnPower Adhoc (commodity only and without ancillary curve positions) for EOD 10/26. Please confirm if these are consistent with your reports -- we want to be able to use these numbers for the DPR.

Also note, these do not include positions outside EnPower; I'll pull those spreadsheet positions from RiskTrac.

Thanks.

Jeff,

I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.  When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?  My guys (and myself for that matter) have seen and heard of people moving into the program and I am getting a lot of questions on the matter.  

Thanks,

Errol

Guys,
 
Please make sure we have everything flipped out per the message below.
 
Thanks,
 
Errol
Hey guys,
 
I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to please have someone go through all your books to look for any deals with ECC and a third counterparty for October and November 2001 production.  I'll try to find as many as I can, but I'm not as familiar with all of your books as you are, and I don't want any deals to be missed.  If you come across any deals can you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible as there are only a couple more days left this month, and settlements needs to get started on invoicing.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
Thanks
Stacey

I haven't talked w/ him for awhile.  I will give him a call.

Any update from the guy from London?

 
Hey Errol,
 
I did a search in the NG-Price book and came up with these four deals to be flipped right away.
 
QN9713.1  	
QO0166.1  	
YE9269.1  	
YE9269.2  	
 
 
Please make sure the first two are flipped before the end of the day today as I need to invoice them first thing in the morning.
 
Thanks
Stacey

Can you give John a call and get him what he needs.  I don't know anything about the request.  I gave him some of ours and he needed one of yours.

Thanks,

Errol

Which book ?  I think the ENA part at the end is not correct.  It should be CAL or SJ or something like that.  If you give me the trader name or a specific deal to look at I can look it up.  Let me know if I can help you do this.

Working on it -- Joey is running mini-books.

As discussed yesterday, please run a mini-book on two the  P&G deals that I gave Errol (details showing the exact legs involved with NG-MM are also given) to determine the exact position and M to M value of these deals.  These deals will ultimately be given to EES for them to manage but we will keep our traders indifferent P&L and position wise.  If you can get this to me by early this afternoon, that would be great.

Thanks

JR
Jeff, 

Can you take this over for me?  There is a deal with Procter & Gamble that Troy Black originated.  It was booked as a sale with ENA but should be in the EES books.  According to Mark Breese ENA should be kept whole, to the mids only, not against offers.  There were also hedges on the volumes that need to be moved as well.  I have asked Troy and Derek Baily about these hedges and they don't know anything about it.  I doubt that a hedge was done specifically for these deals so we may have to get bids/offers to fill the position that is left when the deals are moved to EES.  Can you get with Derek Baily and take care of this today?

Thanks

Kam

need to work with you to transfer a deal from your books to our.... Your trader is  Troy Black,  Deal is sale at TCO city gate -- retail deal.  We need to transfer the short, the hedges (including basis and some triggers) to our books --- should be flat (i.e., p/l stays with you......

This looks like the macro problem we talked about.  Let me know what I need to do to fix.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Errol,

Is a Macro problem your final answer on this??

I need an answer on this. If the beginning balances were changed in error, please let me know this so I can determine what I need to do to fix this variance. Again, this change did not affect your P&L.

In the January 2001 PG book DPR, for the EOL Gas Daily Roll, you reduced your beginning Gross Balance for January by $9,066,220 and you increased your beginning Liquidated Balance for January by $9,066,220. So, the EOL Gas Daily Roll stayed flat in total and did not cause a problem P&L wise. However, this amount is falling out on my reconciliation for January. Could you please tell me what deal or deals were liquidated for $9,066,220, which in turn caused a reduction in your MTM?? We are concerned that these may be third party deals that Financial Settlements are not aware of.

Thanks!!

Shannon McPearson

Norman,

I am not able to calc using the shortcut on my desktop.  I can copy the Post-ID and set it up.  When I try to calc I get a message saying, "unable to connect".  Can you please help?

Thanks,

Errol

Dear All,

Please test the Stage Release of PortCalc version 4.2.1s1 and let us know of the results.  

The executable is      /stage/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr        

	New Features:

Version 4.2.1s1

Changes Affecting All:

Asian strip

Fixed the Curve shift numbers in the adhoc table.

Index Option

Break up one single adhoc record into two records for physical and financial.

Basis Option

Fixed the issue on the break down of Peak and Off Peak curve shift for the second delivery point.

Performance Improvement

Disable unnecessary sensitivity calculation to improve performance typical for hourly options.

Cross Portfolio flag form deal entry is now used. Before this change, PortCalc used to determine which deal is cross portfolio using internal logic.

Curve and Position Manager

PortCalc will now populate the peak_hours_num, off_peak_hours_num, sun_peak_hours_num and sat_peak_hours_num columns in the adhoc table to provde volumetric information for the Curve and Position Manager.

Changes Affecting Australia:

Asian strip

Always use curve price for effective date to avoid next-day financial true up for that day, so that current previous day value can tie up yesterday's value.

SRA

	New Deal type.

Changes Affecting VATR:

Populate the INSTR_TYPE_CD as TRANSMISSION in the pwr_vatr_port_posn  table for Transmission deals.

Please do not hesitate to ask if there is any questions.

	Thanks,

Norman.

Kam,

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.

Let me know how I can help.

Errol

Errol,

Apparently CES has stopped paying us for the attached deals.  Michelle Stevens in financial settlements is wondering if all CES trades were sold off  to The New Power Company but I have no idea if that's true.  Do you know anything about this?  The bottom 5 trades are in your books.

Let me know if you know more about CES.

Thanks

Kam

Kam,

Here is a spreadsheet that shows all trades that are being disputed.   << File: CES Trades that have not been paid.xls >> 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Done.

Thanks,

Errol,

I have saved a DPR, in the regions path, for the NG Gas Deferred for 10/01. Please save the file NGDKRS1001good, as your file for the NGDKRS1001. I had to change your beginning balances for 10/01 to tie to your ending balances for 09/01 and I changed your gross book balance so that it ties to the value in Schedule C. These changes, however, did not change your P&L for the month.

Thanks!

Errol,

We think that we have discovered an error in the system.  Elena has been valuing the San Diego Gas & Electric position.  It looks as if the mid for Dec 01 NGI Socal is in the system as $-.046.  The actual index however was $2.27.  Could you or someone in your group pls look into this and let us know asap.  We need to value this deal correctly so that we can unwind it.

Tom:

Buffalo Gap would be just fine.

Bert

Tom:

Earlier I wrote that it would be easier for me to meet downtown because I don't have my car.  However, Molly has made an unexpected trip to PA so I have her car.  Meeting @ the Buffalo Gap is not a problem anymore.

Bert

Bill:

For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.  Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).  I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.  Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.  I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.  If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Bert

Tom:

If it is not too much trouble, I would prefer to meet downtown.  I now live downtown and currently do not have a car.  If that is not possible, its no big deal, I will just take a cab over to the buffalo gap.  Just let me know...

Bert

Tom:

I would be delighted to meet with you over breakfast.  I am available for both of the times you suggested, just name the time and the place.

Regards,

Bert

Hi Bertmeister!
Good to have you back in the UBS fold. It is also good to hear all is going
well for you and Molly. I would look forward to getting together sometime,
perhaps for breakfast next Tuesday or Wednesday (2/5 or 2/6). Let me know
which works for you.

Tom

Tom:

Just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that I am again an employee
of UBS.  As I am sure you are aware, we are in process of transition from
Enron to UBS.  I recently filled out all the appropriate paperwork to
complete the transition.  From what I understand we are going to be a part
of the trading arm of UBS Warbug.  This should be very exciting.  Maybe one
day I will have the opportunity to trade stocks, bonds, or some other
financial product if power ever becomes old hat.  

Furthermore, I have will soon receive a signing bonus and a raise, so I
intend on funding my IRA and my wife's IRA for 2001 and maybe even 2002.  If
it wouldn't be too much trouble, I would like to know what the contribution
levels are for 2002.  I think I saw something that changed them and the
income levels one can have for a Roth.

As for Molly, the advertising business seems to be picking up for 2002.  She
opened enough new business in the fourth quarter of 2001 to meet her goals
and is on her way to making it the first quarter as well.  I think she is
really beginning to understand her business.

Anyway, I currently have lots of time to myself since we are not trading, so
maybe we can have lunch sometime.  If that is not possible, no big deal, I
know that you are extremely busy.

I hope all is well with you and your family.

Sincerely,

Bert

Bill:

Last night as I was trying to log onto the ADS machine I kept getting a server error.  You will probably want to let one of the IT guys know of this problem

Bill:

Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:

Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).

Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).

SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).

I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.

Regards,

Bert Meyers

Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young 
people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If 
there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help 
with the kids or anything.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick 
alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big 
Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That 
is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real 
good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

Yes, I will be at choir tonight.

See you then!

My id is pmims

What's happening?  How's your day going so far?  Mine is pretty good so far, 
we'll see at 2:10 p.m. when the Nymex closes.   Are you doing rehearsal 
tonight?  I still need to get me a good black dress, I really liked your red 
dress.  I need something on that order .  See you later!!!!

I heard they closed the schools because of too much snow!  What's it look 
like?

The lady's name is Charlene Jackson.  I don't know here, but give her a call 
and check it out.  See you Sunday!

I really don't remember the name, but it was a man.  He specifically quoted 
dollar amounts of $9,475.808.18 vs. $9,298,971.71.  Hope this helps!

Thank you very much1

Hi Darla,

Could you please help me out?  Someone from Nicor called me last week and 
said we had a discrepancy for September business.  All he said was that there 
is a difference of $176,836 that we owe them.

Can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is?

Thanks for your help.

Scott,

Finally, here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April, 1999.

Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs. $2.74 
on 10,000 MMBtu per day.  If this is true, please pay the difference of 
$0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April, 1999.

If your understanding is different, please let me know, but otherwise please 
pay the difference.

Thank you for your patience, and sorry it took so long to resolve.

Hey Daddy,

What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!!  
Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in 
one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight.  
So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.  So 
needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.  The boys are going 
over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I 
will just stay downtown.  I understand that you guys had some bad weather as 
well, I know Mom was out of school.

I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it 
so much.  Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.  Todd 
bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.  
It's really cute.  On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected 
because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.  It was just  a new 
experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.

Anyway, I'll send your tape.

See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis

Love 

Bernie

How are you doing today?  Boy, isn't it cold!!!!!!  I don't think I will be 
at choir rehearsal tonight because of work.  Isn't the Christmas program 
Sunday?  I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.  We've only had two 
non-dedicated practices for the program.

We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double 
Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not 
being able to get in tomorrow morning.  It's supposed to rain or lightly mist 
tonight between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.   The streets are supposed to be 
treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you 
might want to talk with your supervisor  to come up with a contingency plan 
for the weather.

Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!

See Attached

Well, hell, I forgot the attachment!  Here it is........

What's happening?  I know you've been busy, I remembered that Thursday night 
is Ciera's (spelling?) review night.  Everything is well here at work and at 
home.  I 'm leaving early today, probably, around 3:00 p.m.  We've had a 
pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week..  Next 
week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest, so it will really 
be a busy work week.

  I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today, whether it be late 
tonight (you know they're open until 11:00 p.m. I think) or right after 
work.  I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha 
if I make it out.   Do you want to go in on it, I was going to spend  about 
$25 (believe me, she is looking for a gift!).

 Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party?  We're still going to mine, 
but girl, we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in 
Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field.  My regular 
babysitter could not do it.  Anyway, holler at me!

Please attached!

Hi Melba,

While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a 
new product called:  NGPL North Shore Gas Company.

The description should be:

The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North 
Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago.

I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.

Thanks for your help!

P.S.   Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.

Thanks

Girl, you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .  Now you know I don't 
know.  It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead.  He probably 
won't spring it on you Sunday, because we did not do that good without you 
there.

I am so tired from last night.  Everything is so rushed, and I did not get 
the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m.  I'm 
tired, so I know they are.  On top of all of that, the market is up another 
$1.00 today (yeah!!), but we have to stay late tonight  to go over our 
positions as a group.  My boss said that we will all stay until it's done, so 
make arrangements.  Naturally, Todd is working the evening shift, so I'm 
trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter.  They just 
live right down the street.  So we'll see!  Talk with you later!

Please see attached! 

Greg set me up a nice little sheet.  So here is the updated version with new 
volumes!

	
	

P,

Please forward this to GD.  Thanks,

P,

No, but let me see what I can come up with.  It's early now, so it will be 
about another hour before they start to show up here in the office.  I'll let 
you know.

	
	

P,

Please forward this to GD.  Thanks,

Bobbi,

Here is the final for March, 2001, I'm preparing the April, 2001  sheet as 
well!

Attached are the Chicago prices.  The Michcon and Consumers are coming later.

	
	

P,

Please forward this to GD.  Thanks,

Kevin

Bobbi,

Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November, 
2000.  I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both 
the firm and interruptible.  Those schedules will probably be revised once we 
get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".

Thanks

It's about time, but well worth the wait.  He's is soooooo cute!

We sold Steve a package of 10,000 at the Nipsco city gate.

Thanks for your help!

This is super fantastic!!!  See, it all pays off!  I can't wait to talk with 
you and find out more about it!  Let me know if you are rolling tonight!

Sorry, it took so long!  It's kind of hard to say, but just say that during 
an altercation ......, but you do not have to say with who, I really don't 
know, but let me know what you come up with.  How much detail  are they 
looking for with the Police report!

Hey guys,

Here is the activity sheet for November.  All activity is for the Balancing 
Agreement only!!!!!

I am planning to inject approximately 15,000 MMBtu per day for the rest of 
the month and that should put me in a pretty good position.  Please respond 
when you have a minute.

Thanks

I can't do anything on Tuesday nights, but let me know about Monday.  I just 
need a couple of days notice.

Val,

What is this e-mail about, did you mean to send it to me?  Send me some of 
those funny jokes that are going around.

Talk to ya later!

Hey thanks for the info.   Ann, from Alliance, said that 160,000 MMBtu/d went 
to Peoples, so, it's all making sense.

Thanks again!

So, I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !  Robin and 
Anna have the strangest way of doing things.  I asked Robin at least two 
weeks ago, and she said she had to get with Anna, and now she's telling you 
that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to 
me.  Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again, because 
at this point, I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night, and 
he'll be tired on Saturday (although that's no problem).  But, like last 
time, I don't want to go if you can't go.  Let me try and call her and we'll 
talk later.  So are you free on Saturday?

Also, everything is going okay over here, the market is down severely this 
morning, so we'll see!  

That's news to me!  I don't think I like Razoo's.  I'll have to see if I'm 
available.

Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.    In 
fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.  Are you free?, are 
they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.  What did they say?

So hello,

What happened at rehearsal last night?  I did not make it, partly because I 
was tired and I had several errands to take care of.  I needed to stop by 
K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed, and 
just did not want to be out late.

Let me know!!!

Talk to you later.

P.S. is everthing else going okay?

Hey Rev. Jackson,

Hello sir, how are you?  Well, I tell you Pastor really outdid himself 
yesterday.  I really enjoyed his sermon.  He really has a knack for weaving a 
story and making it applicable to today's events, etc.

Tasha and I got so tickled, watching you sing that song.  You did very well.  
We said, "Look at Rev. Jackson, he's jammin".

Well, anyway, talk to you later!

Hey girl,

What's happening?  Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that 
I will never, ever go back over to that church again.  It's a nice, small 
church, but those folks crack me up.  Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat 
next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.  This time, those 
fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey.  
They're fools!  I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!  So, just 
remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed 
seeing the baptismal pool! 

Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.  Last night, Todd cleaned 
out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.  I was a little 
unnerved, especially with the kids.  I had the kids put on their shoes and 
socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.  I was a praying sister.  
That really scared me.  Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this 
morning!  Oh well, talk with you later!

What's up with this guy.  I guess he called Mr. Palmer.  How did that come 
about!  He really feels as though he's been mistreated.  I don't understand 
him!

Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.   You know how they have the news on 
around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you 
have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a 
wrong or right issue".   Always trying to rhyme!   Can you believe that 
idiot.  I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.

I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is 
suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.  If you're an authority 
on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.  He's something 
else.  He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!! 

When you here from Hope, please let me know what she says about Greg's house 
and get the address and I'll print out the MapQuest.

Hi Mark,

I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance 
Pipeline.  As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to 
start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.  As with any new 
pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.   I would 
like to create a product that has a description that addresses the 
uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that 
gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.

Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.

I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.

Thank you

Girl, isn't that sad about the election results and the recount.  It's really 
terrible.  Everybody over here is watching it very, very closely.  They 
really want Bush to win in a bad way.  I'm tired of hearing about it!   How 
are things over your way.

My day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I 
was shocked, but appreciative.  I think I might go car shopping this weekend 
if the weather is nice.

Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million 
dollar house?  Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it 
probably was correct!  We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days.  I 
want to see this house!

Talk to you later.

Boy, it looks like this is really going to be a tight, tight, race.  As far 
as your other issue, I would just say very professionally, that "there are 3 
subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about, and they are voting, 
religion and salaries." and just keep it at that.  You also might want to 
add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects."

That way, you've communicated your desires in a concise, professional 
manner.  

Talk to you later!

Hey Girl,

I'm back and I had a wonderful time.  Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to 
get around in.  The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a 
result I have a little cold and sore throat.  The wedding was very nice.  The 
wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.  The reception 
was "the bomb".  It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, 
money.  I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.  She had 
a reception for around 150 to 250 people.  I'm not good at looking at a crowd 
and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.  She had a buffet 
dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, 
beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj 
and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.  It was 
really nice.  Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was 
nice.  She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.  We 
went shopping and sight-seeing.  We even went to go find the grade school 
that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix  
many, many years ago.  It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know 
what word I'm trying to say).

Did you go to church Sunday?  If so, how was it?  I really did miss not going 
to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?  Kids and Steve doing okay?  I 
can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.

Talk to you later.  I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me 
when we get the kids wound down!

Girl, I'm on my way to the airport in about 15 minutes!  I'll leave the phone 
on!

Hey girl,

I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!  It's been up 
and down over here, but I'm hanging!  Hope everything is going well with 
you.  Did the kids enjoy Halloween?  My kids sure did.  I did not realize 
that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.  I wasn't 
going anyway!  

Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be 
back on Sunday afternoon.

Talk with you later.

Sorry, I arrive on Continental 1505 at 7:31 p.m. and I leave on Sunday at 
11:30 p.m. on Continental.

What's Happening?

How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get 
my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you 
spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I 
don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  
Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch 
with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and 
still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it 
gets dark.

Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?

Talk with you later!

Sorry, forgot the attachment!

Hey baby!!!

Here you go!!!

Yes, that's fine!  --- Is it inside the terminal or do I have to drag around 
on a bus to find it.  You know the cheap ones are like that!

That's so sweet of you to let me know, but we will not be there this weekend, 
we just went about two weekends ago.   I'm thinking about taking the kids to 
this farm out in my part of town.  My understanding is that it is open to the 
public, but I'm trying to get the name of the place.  Diane Cook has taken 
her kids there, so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info.   
Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!!!  (He'll 
probably be scared to death once we get there!)

I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday.  What costumes 
did the kids where?

Chicago is $0.125 an Dawn is $.245.

yes, cool!

Can we make sure we set up that appointment today?  Let me know.

Okay, I'll send it via the mail.  I like your new hair style, it looks good!

When I remember to put a new book oif checks in my purse, do you want me to 
make it out to you or give you cash!

Hi,

Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here, 
just huge price moves.

Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is 
concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning 
process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So 
make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already 
know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each 
Morning.

My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.  Please look at the Nigas 
Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.

My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2 
days.  If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or 
whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).

P.S. I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara # 
436296.  He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise.   
His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.

I'll be back on Wednesday.

Please let me know why my VAR is $2.2 million.  My position is 108.3 short, 
so I need to know why the VAR is so large .  Hunter would like an answer as 
soon as psossible.

Thanks

 

Hi Nellie,

What's happening?  I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you 
have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.  I made 
the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is 
$159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can 
split it three ways.  Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, 
although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.  
Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.  I spoke with 
Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see 
if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from 
her yet, nor am I holding my breath.  She said her colors are burgundy and 
gold, if I remember correctly.  

Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that 
Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class 
for his age group.  This class is called the "Hope Team"  and it gets the 
kids ready for competition.  I did not realize he was that good, although I 
could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).  I called to 
inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have 
to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, 
ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!" 

Well, anyway, we'll  see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day.  
We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it.
Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.  I 
was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll 
probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).

I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly 
getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.  Let me know what you're 
hearing?  Talk to you later.

Girl, you are good, how much do I owe?

How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Did you receive my response to 
your last e-mail?  I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not.  Nothing new going 
on here.  I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th.  
I really haven't made any plans, but maybe we'll go visit my family in 
Omaha.  It's really hard for me to plan, b/c I may have to work some of the 
week.  I'm not sure yet, so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be 
interrupted.

Church services were  really good this past sunday, Pastor preached a good 
sermon.  

Talk with you later

Thanks for the note, that was very sweet of you.  I always believe in helping 
wherever I can, b/c the next day it'll be me!

I just sent you along e-mail, let me know if it came over, I hope so, it took 
me 20 minutes to type it!

Horace Jackson <hjackson@SWCBC.net> on 09/28/2000 01:56:11 PM
 Hey Stranger,

  I hope your day is going well. It's been an extremely busy
week for me but I'm still blessed.I thought about you this morning and was
wondering how things were going? Thursday is my day that I'm out in the
field visiting members that are sick and in the hospital. Well, I guess I
won't see you until Sunday, Keep the faith and don't give up.

        Be
Encourage,
        Rev. Jackson

Where are you going?

Thanks for the note.  Will you work tomorrow and the weekend?

Girl, you know he's lying.  He's a trip, but it was a good sermon.

Hey baby, 

Getting back to the Alliance issue, what is happening.  I know I have my 
nerve because I was supposed to provide a list.  Sorry, I forgot, but 
anyway.....................here's a list:

Nicor  Dave Brown  630-983-8676 X2106
PGLC  Dave Wear 312-240-4554
Dynegy  Scott Maxfield 713-767-8030
Duke  John Alrich 713-260-8578

You know the rest.

Call me when you get a chance

Jesus,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, 
May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along 
with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly 
volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you 
that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  
The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

Thanks

Hey Home,

Just a note to tell you thanks again for being my "roaddog".  It really 
helped me out!  You're the "bomb"!

Just tried to call you.  Please call me before you leave, and yes, you 
probably need to leave, but where will you go?

If you go straight hme, emotions are running too high for it to be a safe 
environment right now.  I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right 
now.  You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we 
normally would not do.  Please do not put yourself in that position!!!!

Please call me!

Here are the rates that Midwestern and NGPl gave to me about a week ago.  
I'll double-check the rates this afternoon.

Talk with you later

Judy,

I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the 
following contracts:

Wisconsin Power & Light  96045691

WPS     96001003

Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you, 
just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).

Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.  We have no idea what it is, and we're 
looking for the non-performance language associated with it.

Thanks!

Hi Jewel,

Sorry, I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day, 
but things have been extremely busy around here, and plus, there is very 
little room for privacy.

In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the 
day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, 
but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will 
consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I 
think it's one of those things that once you "get your foot in the door", you 
can move on from there.

Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require 
working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.

As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail 
to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he 
has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest, 
and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning 
what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.   
Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then 
he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually 
pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.

Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!

Take care!

Good afternoon Rev. Jackson.

So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured 
out.  Hope your day is going well.  Sometime, please tell me what "A Day in 
the Life of Rev. Jackson" is like at SWCBC.  Do you see alot of people all 
day long (during the day)?  So often, it's hard to picture the church as 
being active all day long.  It just seems like people attend meetings and 
services about twice a week in the evenings.  Funny, how we get perceptions 
in our heads.

My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my "book" 
here at work and it sure feels good.  I've always remembered what you told me 
during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind.  The one that 
I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in 
perfect peace".  I take that with me everywhere I go.

Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.

Appreciate it!

Hi Rev. Jackson

How's it going?  I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but 
I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?

Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.  I'll be leaving at 
5:00 directly.

See you tonight!

Melba

provide as soon as you can, and if you don't mind, can you please give me an 
estimated time.

Many thanks

I have booked my flights, I leave on Thursday, November 2nd at 5:45 p.m. and 
arrive in Phoenix at 7:31 p.m. on Continental.  I leave on Sunday at 11:27 
a.m. and arrive in Houston at 3:00 p.m.   How was the picnic?  We finally got 
some decent weather yesterday and its supposed to continue through the 
weekend.  See you later. 

So nice to hear from you.  Everything here is hot, hot, hot, 107 degrees 
today.  Nothing new going on here, the boys are doing great, just getting 
really big.  I'm taking Kendall to the Dr. today to see if he has an ear 
infection, he was up most of the night last night (rats!).  Jordan is so 
cool, he taking gynmastics again and loving it.  Kendall is my little 
roughneck!, he reminds me of myself, he's hysterical.  I am so glad I have 
them!!!!

The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun, I think it's just going to be 
Mom, Me and Nelle I think.   I'm leaving the kids with Todd.  Todd has a new 
job where he works 12 hour shifts.  In fact, he's working with Ken Cowan,  
but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am,  It sucks when he's 
working nights, but he really likes it.

Anyway, we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to 
roll.  Anyway take care, talk with you soon!

Hi Dexter!

Give me another couple of days, we're still checking.  Did I tell you that 
Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she 
could pay for Shawna's wedding, as well as take care of her business.   So 
you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding, (girl, you 
know how that goes, now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of 
money?)   You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real 
estate, or something like that.  Ralph West came to our groundbreaking 
ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette.  He is awesome.  I told 
him I enjoyed his sermon, and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the 
next day.  Do you have acrobat on your computer?  I'll try to send you 
picture to see if it comes out.

Talk with you later.

I think we should all stay in the same room, especially if we get a suite at 
embassset suites, with a pull-out bed.  We checked it out and I can get there 
are 7:30 p.m. on America West on Thursday.  The rate is $305.00, a little 
pricey.    Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal 
dinner?  I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see.

I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a 
room at Embassy  Suites for $39 per night.  It's supposed to be at I-17 and 
Greenway, wherever that is.   I'll belive that when I see it.   I probably 
will not bring the kids, it just seems like such a hassle.  I can understand 
Mom not wanting to miss work, so it seems like it will be a girls weekend.  I 
have not checked on flight arrangements yet, but I'll let you know.   I still 
want to leave on Thursdat night, so we have time for site seeing.  How much 
was the ticket?

Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last 
Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and 
they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me 
asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went 
to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In 
fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling 
because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha 
and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl 
one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  
Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like 
in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so 
nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind 
you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of 
one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one 
with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I 
didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she 
made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to 
leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 
other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I 
think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff 
together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.

Talk with you later

Hi,

How's it going?  You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week.  
We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week.  Sometimes the Tuesday 
night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys, that sometimes we 
spend Wednesday recuperating (i.e. getting the boys and myself to bed 
early).  It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep 
them.  

Girl, what did you think of that Jon P. Kee song that Joe and that girl were 
singing on Tuesday.  The choir really wasn't into that one.  We just could 
not muster up a good sound!   Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony?  
If so, let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to 
the tent!  I'm 75% sure that I will be attending.

Talk to you later.

Hi Calvin

I spoke with Rickey (boy, is he long-winded!!).  Gave him the name of our 
credit guy, Russell Diamond.

Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.  I 
came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to 
talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I 
still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i 
came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you 
posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!

See you later.

Girl, so now you see!  Karen just has issues!  So how are you doing?  I was 
on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today.

We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion.  The weather 
was great compared to Texas.  Texas is so hot!!  How's Christian doing?  My 
boys are doing pretty good, just growing so fast.

Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance.

See ya!

I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good 
church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and 
encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!

Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with 
Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his 
birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe 
something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, 
socks, etc.)

Talk to ya!

I just called my other friend, her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 
281-484-2380.  She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times 
before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You, but said its a really 
sexy song,  Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas.  She's a 
professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs.  Take care!

Yes, she'snot familiar with the music, but said she would listen to the music 
and see what she thought, but I have put in a call to my other friend, but I 
know she would do it if her schedule was open, but she does is 
professionally, and I know there would be a charge,  I should hear something 
today from my other friend.

Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he 
choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of 
fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be 
gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I 
haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking 
the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback 
riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon 
got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' 
Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, 
instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with 
this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!

That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the 
fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey 
publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this 
issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a 
magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late 
night.  See you later

Daddy,

I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted 
to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.  

I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for 
you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from 
me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!

Love Bernie!

Yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are

"I Believe in You and Me" by Whitney Houston

and

"Kissing You" by Faith Evans

Yes, I'll ask her, but I also know someone else that sings at weddings 
professionally!  Do you know what song?

No, I don't know her number. but Anessa is , huh!  Just call up to the church 
and give them your count for dinner for the kids.

Hey Robert,,

Sorry I was out on vacation, and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his 
headhunter, but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week.

Take care!

Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well 
I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really 
meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 
11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall 
Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!

Test message, I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it,  my e-mail is acting up, 
so before I re-type this, I want to see if you get this!

Hey Bobbi,

Here is a revised nomination sheet for March, and also, I know you'll be 
shocked, but I sent the contract to the lawyers for approval, so we should 
get it back shortly!

See ya

Hi Roni

Charnella had asked that I send you information regarding scooters.

The outfit is called Scoot Around North America.  They have a web site at 
www.scootaround.com.  Their phone number is 1-888-441-7575.

Hope this works out for you.

Take Care!

I'm sorry, I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m.  I thought I had 
responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay, but I checked my 
e-mails and discovered that I did not respond.   Anyway, my fault, what's 
good for you next week?  ( I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back, 
instead of just putting it on my calendar.)

Thanks

Hi Marlo,

This deal was done on Enron Online, so do we need to get further information 
from Enron Online?

Please let me know?

Hey Sugar Bear!

I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay 
for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's 
Erika doing?

You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron 
Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the 
front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they 
hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the 
church, not matter what the situation is.

Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!

 

So nice to hear from you.  I miss not being able to see you and talk with you 
on a regular basis.  I hope the kids are dong fine.  Jordan went to 
children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor.  He just 
starts smiling when I mention her name.  That little mannish boy already 
likes girls, I think.    Anyway, things are going okay, I'm still leaning 
toward trying to find a part-time position next year.  This job is so very 
hard!

Take care!

Thanks for the schedule.  If the game with Seattle is still available on 
Thursday, April 5, I would love to use the seats.

Thanks for your help!!!

Sorry, can't do it on Thursday, but what about Friday sometime?

It s/b sitara # 695208.

Hi Jeanie,

What is your schedule looking like for this week or next in the late 
afternoon?

Thanks for the "words of encouragement".  I just sent an e-mail to my Human 
Resources Rep and will wait to get a response.  I am so READY!!.  I've set up 
a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again 
since I really have made up my mind.  

Talk with you tonight!

Hi Jeannie,

Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time 
employment. I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop 
you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within 
the company.  I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a 
strong interest in part-time employment.  Please let me know if anything 
comes up, and also if we need to meet.

I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( 
please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position 
on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm 
interested in part-time employment.  I've casually mentioned this to him in 
the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.

Thanks for your help!

Sorry, it took so long to respond to the e-mail.  Hope, you guys are doing 
well!  
Yes, I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees!  We 
really need to get something out pretty soon to the people.  Grandpa says 
people are calling, (I wonder if its just one or two people), but 
nevertheless, we still need to get something out.

Talk with you soon!

Hey,

How's it going today?  I've been thinking about you and Siera.  Did things go 
alright last night.  Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or 
are you not going to know anything until tomorrow?  
I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk 
to you tonight.

Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.  I thought that was funny, he said they had 
told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he 
would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.  He then 
went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because 
I was a generous contributor.  I then proceeded to give him a piece of my 
mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.  
By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that 
Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.  That's interesting.  I can only 
imagine what happened there!

Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?  I have some, but it's old, and 
I had been thinking about buying something new.  I might go to Sharpstown and 
have a look, but that is not set in stone.  It depends on what type of time I 
have and what type of mood I'm in.  You know we're supposed to wear our 
African attire on Sunday.  You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan 
Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m.  I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.  I'm 
tired of going to the same places.  We need some variety.  Gregg needs to get 
some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the 
outings.  And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.  If we 
have to sing "In the Sanctuary"  one more time, I'm going to throw up.  

I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off.  
It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, 
and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.

See you later!!!!!

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .

Yes, it is working, you're up early this morning, it's not even noon yet.  
You must be feeling good today!

As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA. 
and just renting a house on the beach.  I've never been there, but have heard 
a few good things about it.  I'm trying to get more information before I go 
ahead and book a house.  Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat 
reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.  God is 
good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.  Have you made any plans yet?  If 
you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.

Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY.  
They all seem to get along real well.

So my girl, has good taste.  I knew she had it in her.  I really, really like 
my Tahoe.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It took me about a month to get 
used to it, but now I'm rolling.  Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know 
when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.  I would love 
to get together again.

So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.  I can't wait until we 
can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.  We're always so 
busy, "A woman's work is never done".  

I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town 
and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.

I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, 
President's Day?  I'm off and can't wait.

I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child. 

Love you!!

.

I certainly will, I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!!!

Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me 
yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as 
well?

I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to 
be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to 
talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the 
last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I 
always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The 
number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but 
anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my 
business card.

Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.

Talk with you soon.

Just in case, I have not made it real PLAIN, you deliver an AWESOME Video,  
It is extremely professional, easy to follow, and concise!

Keep up the GOOD WORK!

Thanks again!!!

Hi there!

Just checking on you.  Did you make it to practice last night and did 
Lucretia's husband keep the kids? (smile).  If so, what time did you get back 
home, I know it was late.  I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what 
they had in the way of western attire for the kids.  They did not have much, 
and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.    I was looking for western 
shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a 
Western store on Gessner.  Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.  
Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.  I walked out saying 
that these people are serious about their western wear.

I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on 
my headphones.  It sure helps alot.  I can get away with it, because we have 
certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear  
headphones to hear, so it looks good.  Plus, the boss doesn't mind.  We 
listen to music just about all day anyway.  Have you heard the Chester D.T. 
Baldwin tape.  I think it's one of my favorites.  Speaking of gospel, is your 
family  still planning on  doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for 
the family reunion?  I was wondering about that!

Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call 
her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her 
business.  

Talk with you later!

Hi 

I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively.   Hunter will be out of 
the office on Tuesday, and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on 
that same afternoon.

Thank you for the invitation!

I don't know where that came from, it's old,  but it reminds me of that song, 
"Hey Little Walter!"

My dad called last night and he had a terrific day on Sunday.  GOD is good!

Hi Shielah,

I agree with changing the deal to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily-Daily Flat for 
the December 22-26 time period.  Please ask Julie to change the ticket, I 
always get confused.  Thanks

That is WONDERFUL!!!!!!

Did you check with Steve about the rodeo on February 18th?  I want to try to 
get tickets this evening.

Talk to you later.

Just checking up on you to see how you're feeling.  Are you feeling alright?  
How did the last test go?

Do you all have any rodeo tickets?  I'm thinking about going to stand in 
line?  I want to see Destiny's Child, what about you?

Yes, We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning, we'll be back on Monday.  
Take care and Happy Easter!

Alright, I'll check into both places.  I thought you were going to the Dr. 
today?  After I typed this, I said to myself, I guess I could have re--read 
your original memo.

Anyway, how often do you check your e-mail at home, because I can start using 
this to talk to you?

Hey girl,

How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two 
days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home 
until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight 
and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the 
grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and 
cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting 
ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was 
exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 
1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was 
tired.

This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would 
like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for 
that.

Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and 
Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.

Talk with you later!

Hi Daddy,

 I was thinking about you earlier this morning.  Glad to hear that you are 
not in any pain right now.  We just need to keep pressing to find the right 
combination of medicine.  My experience has been to be very persistent with 
the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot 
with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not 
communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for 
pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines 
that will get the job done.  

I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your 
"breakthrough" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you 
were talking about!

I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach 
for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were 
closed,I forgot about the time difference.  I 'm probably hesitating because 
I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this 
is the right place.  What are your thoughts?

Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt".  Hope 
it's not too painful.

Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.

Is this your home e-mail or your office?

Hey girl,

Where are the pictures, they were not attached.  I'll call you this afternoon.

Patrice

I bought a car, please do not e-mail me anymore!

I plan to withdraw 500,000 for the month, I will revise sheet as we revise 
the volumes, but the plan is to withdraw 500,000.

Thanks

P.S. Kelli is going to send the Midcontinent volumes & prices.

Sorry, I got a little trigger happy!

How did it go with Lil' Steve.  Were you able to get his fever reduced?  Poor 
thing, I hope he's feeling better.  How Siera?  Well, anyway, just was 
thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line.

Are you rehearsing tonight?

Hey Lizzie

Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily 
Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus 
$0.01.   I have revised both tickets.

Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla.

Hey Kenny.

Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it
gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's
not real good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer
and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very
weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn
out.  Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many
places).  He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking
regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain,
which he's in half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight,
but he's in good spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear
him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really
hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put
on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see
your parents going through this kind of suffering.

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over
matter, along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for
Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really
do.

Talk to you later!

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, 
along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't 
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for Mom 
as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.

Talk to you later!

Hey girl,

You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.  I called her cell phone 
and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.  I cracked 
up!  Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.  That reminds me 
when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.  I 
answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She 
said, oh that's for me".  I cracked up!

Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was 
standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was 
Patrice.  Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?  He's back 
down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.  He's turned into a nice 
looking young man.  I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.  She 
seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.  I'll call her 
back one of these days when I have more time.

Missed you at Jordan's party.  Silly me, I didn't figure it out until 
Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.  I initially thought it was 
from Shayla.

Well anyway, you rolling?

Grant,

Please review and let' discuss how to resolve.

Thanks
	
	

I have two counterparties that we have invoiced for gas on December 13th - 
Coral and CMS.  In both cases I am being told that this gas is also  being 
invoiced by Petro-Canada and that it was baseload and at a cheaper price than 
what we are invoicing them for.

The deal numbers are  CMS Marketing  #529459 22000 @ 9.10 = $200200.00
    Coral   #529442 8000 @ 8.90 = $71200.00

Both counterparties have stated that they will not pay our invoiced amount.  
Is it possible that these deals should be invoiced to Petro-Canada instead of 
CMS and Coral?  Would you let me know what the resolution is?

Thanks  for your assistance

I'm thinking that I have probably missed you, but anyway, it was so nice to 
hear from you.  We're haviing Jordan's birthday party tonight.  So thwat's 
what we'll be doing this weekend!   Talk to you soon!

Love Bernie

Hey Gang,

I've called the trader at Sempra and she is researching and will let us know 
something, hopefully, this afternoon.

Thanks

Well, go with Startech's invoice.

Thanks

Hi Priscilla,

These deals are a mess,  I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, 
can't remember all the details.  I will speak with our Calgary office, as 
well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you 
ASAP.  Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith 
is out of the office until Monday.

Thanks, 

Oh no, nothing urgent, I just feel like i take one step forward and two steps 
backward,  you know the drill!

Hope,

You're the Best!!!!!!

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know 
you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab 
over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the 
baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to 
spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the 
regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said 
something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  
Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call 
you on the way home.

See ya!

Cool girl, that'll work out fine.  It sounds like Hope will be attending 
also.  Kenny can't come, so that was disappointing, but I'll see him on 
Saturday for his daughter's party.  Talk with you later.  We need to talk!!!!

Hey lady,

Just in case you are interested, I changed Jordan's party to this Friday 
night at 6:45 p.m. same place.

Love ya!

It will be at 6:45 p.m.   Todd had such a fit because it was on a Monday, 
which I prefer!

Just wanted to confirm  that you guys are available on Friday night for 
Jordan's party.  You never did call me back!

Thank you.

You may call the other product NGPL Nicor GDD.

Thanks again!

Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal 
tonight!!!!!   
Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in 
the audience, but did not see you.  After church let out, I was gone, I was 
home by 1:15 p.m.  That never happens!  I looked for you guys and I said, oh 
well, I'll catch them later.  

By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 
2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,  Yes I'm having it on a 
Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and 
Jordan has his heart set on it.  It's always too crowded and it drives me 
crazy!  So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. and be out of 
there by 8:30 p.m.  It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday 
or a Sunday.  I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small  
Let me know if you're interested.

See you soon!.

Hi Melba,

Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:

The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois.

I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting 
for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.

I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.

Thanks Melba!

I already purchased the vehicle.

Thank you

Hey Greg,

Please forward to Ms. Bobbi.

Thank you

Hey,

I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there 
you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see 
where it ends up.  

Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just 
as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is 
extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least 
he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot 
that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But 
I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there 
next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to 
drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a 
heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!

Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are 
you off?  

I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, 
but she's hanging in there.

See you later!

 

I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management 
Deal.  Please review and let me know what you think!

On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas 
flow on  December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted 
via the telephone. 

The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 
22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 
22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 
22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 
22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, 
which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, 
from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the 
telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little 
over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to 
intentionally reporting erroneous information.

Thank you,  my boss had me on a rush project and he was stressing me out.

Thanks again!

For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 
for activity for December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was 
estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were 
transacted over the telephone:

Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire
Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor
WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor
Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor
PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor
Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor

 
The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most 
companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result, 
volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published 
a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made 
a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, 
from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the 
telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little 
over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to 
intentionally reporting erroneous information.

sounds perfect, -- do you need cash or is a check okay?

Hi Monique,

We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church 
and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay 
products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same 
place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from 
Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to 
send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.

I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, 
and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in 
stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!

  Thank you so much.

Hi Dan

This memo shall confirm our agreement to deliver 3,000 MMBtu's per day to 
National Steel for the above referenced time period.  Deliveries will be at 
the NGPL Nipsco City Gate.

Call if you have further questions.

Thanks

Oh Hope,

So nice to hear from you!  I think about you all the time.  I miss not seeing 
you every Tuesday!  Are you considering coming back any time soon?  If not, I 
certainly understand, we are so "messy".  We just finished "Take it to the 
Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year.  
We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day.  
A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that 
morning.  I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe.  
I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that 
big, and it sits so high, whoa!!

I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and 
everything is going great for you.   We'll have to get together and do a 
"afternoon at the park" with the kids.  Take care.

Love ya!

P.S. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often!

Call id you have any discrepancies.  Thanks

Yes, I'll see you there!

Hey Pooky,

The rest of the weekend was fine.  I forgot to tell you on Saturday night about our choir's performance at this community function we had.  In fact, I was on my way home when you and I were talking.  Sometimes our choir members are so sad, they don't always show up at functions and events like they should, unless its an opportunity to showboat.  So.....I had to sing on the front row on Saturday evening.  We sounded like crap....I was so embarassed, I actually got so hot and started sweating, because of my embarassment.  It was awful.  I just thought about that when your e-mail arrived.  Kendall was very whinny and cried alot yesterday, I actually thought he might be getting sick, because that was so out of character for him, but he's back to his old self now, just talking alot and being hard-headed.

I just called the lawyer again and got the secretary....she said that she had been out sick with pneumonia and the attorney had some major oral surgery, so she could not talk....so I'll give this firm the benefit of the doubt.  The secretary said she would have her call me back shortly or at least the secretary would call me and let me know.

So "F" is starting to feel the effects of his years of dishing out dirt.  I hate that it hurts, but most men do end up regretting their previous behavior.  I know what you mean about your Dad.  In my case, my dad would be saying, hold on....

Anyway, I love you too and can't wait to see where we both go from here.....

When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.  I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

VAL

Hey D,

What is the status on Nicor Enerchange's Master Firm?

They are correct, Cilco city gate does not exist....the only reference point is the Nicor city gate.  As far as the guarant, I'm okay, but the last time we asked them to draft the guarantee, it was horrible.  I'll ask them to send us a draft.

Call me when you get a chance.

thanks

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

I could be wrong, but I believe that the only industrial Cary spoke to was Cargill.  I will look through his files and see if I find anything else.

Can you forward Cary's old industrials info to Patrice?

Come again, what you                                                              talking about?                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                
Gwen is gone!! How are you????  Things are going great here.  Just working away.  (Smile)

Hi Jan,

So nice to hear from you.  I am glad you are finally "enjoying life".  I wish I could join you now.  With the Enron stock and "whatnot", I'll have to hang around alot longer than anticipated (smile).  Are the boys excited about going to "MDO".  I bet that is a change for them, and alot less expensive for you.

The job is going well, I really like it, it is a different kind of stress, but definitely more preferable for me.  I really like what I'm doing.  My  boys are getting the added benefit of Mom being in a really good mood most of the time.  Jordan is doing pretty good in school,  I'm not really sure that he's in love with school, but he's doing well.   Kendall, what can I say?  My Kendall is something else.  He is so funny, and guess what, he talks in a very loud voice, it kills me, i wonder where he got that from!

Suzy is moving to New York this Friday morning.  Her husband's mom lives somewhere in New York and they will be moving there so that he can hopefully find a job.  I hate to see her go, but if it's best for there family, then go for it.

Anyway, take care

Love ya!

How the heck are ya?  I have been thinking of  you alot lately.  I tried to guess your e:mail address a couple of times  over the last couple of months but there is just no guessing it.  I finally  had to call Laura Vuittonet.
 
Well, I'm having a great time home with the  kids.  I really thought I would be bored by now but I feel just a busy just  not as tired.  In fact, for the first time since I had my kids I feel very  rested and at peace.  It's fun being a kid and  running around Houston  when there isn't much traffic and it nice having the time to slow down the  pace.
 
The boys are in Mothers Day Out 2 times a week from  9:00 - 2:00 which really isn't much time at all.  I could use another day  of alone time.  On those days I am usually meeting with Enron or once in a  while I meet a friend for lunch.  Time really flies.
 
Anyway, I hope all is well for you.  Miss  ya.

Hey Tom,

Not as of yet, but it sounds like maybe shortly.  Talk to you later.

Patrice, I have some reporters breathing down my neck wanting to know if I knew

Hi Gene,

As promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.  These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".

January, 2001			$10.99

February, 2001			$  6.61

Mar, 2001			$  5.38

Apr. 2001			$  5.70

May, 2001			$  5.13

June, 2001			$  3.95

July, 2001			$  3.40

August, 2001			$  3.25

September, 2001		$  2.42

October, 2001			$  2.00

I still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.  Please call me at 713-853-5772 once you have had a chance to review the information and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks

These are the changes that Enron Legal would like you to consider.  Please =
review and let me know if these changes are acceptable. These changes would=

Did you get with Alex to find out what hotel?  It is the Westin.  Also, who is Jason and what are HS numbers?  As far as delivery point, yes, it is the interconnect between Midwestern and Vectren (the LDC).  Please make sure and bring your pipeline statements.  Also, I did meet with Jeff Hodge, our attorney, and I know the details regarding the contract.  I'll be in the office until around 10:30.

Thanks

Hi Patrice,

I'm going to get an earlier flight in on Monday. I'll leave Houston at 7:20 and arrive Indianapolis at 9:42. I'll just take a cab to the hotel that night. This is much better so we don't have to worry about being late. 

On a side note--Jason will be calling you regarding some HS numbers. Did you find anything out about the contract and what it says about the delivery point? Are we going to discuss that there? Also, I'm going to try to talk with Lisa Mellancamp and find out exactly which topics are off limits. I know you're leaving Monday, but we'll have time to talk about all this on the drive to Terra Haute.

Hi Lisa,

Will you please add Petro-Canada Oil and Gas to the list of counterparties for Mid-Market.

Thanks

Hey, how are you,  Yes, I'm still here, I'm doing well. 2001 was not a pleasant year for alot of people, and it was certainly no exception for me.  Along with my favorite company going bankrupt, my father passed after a lennghty illness.  But all is well for the time being.  Nice to hear from you.  Tell everyone I said hello.

Thanks for thinking of me!
I was hoping you were. How are you doing?

Hey Pat,

I've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).

Enron's sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.

Per the contract, Enron uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.

I've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.

Let's talk!

Hi Pat,

I spoke with our attorney this afternoon, and he is in the process of contacting your attorney.  It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron, did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into.  Long story, short, our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision.

Thanks 

Hi Pat,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.

P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to look up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go together.

I'll let you know what I find out.

Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after you.
I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
burning rubber.

Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to pray
for her.
How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to Institute
Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the problem
was.

Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard
time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to
look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well
for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan
and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.
She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and
talk.

   Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
   EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
   Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't
   in
   Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make
   you
   feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
   feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

   I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
   plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

   I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?
   I
   was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
   with
   the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
   Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
   all
   the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

   After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving
   a
   small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
   Steve
   asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much
   he
   loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
   also
   apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
   for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
   treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
   speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
   like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
   what.
   He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
   snuggle
   up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
   immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He
   then
   jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
   he's
   6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
   just
   go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
   ask
   where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
   don't have time for his mess.

   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

   Hey girl,

   What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
   could
   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
   they
   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating
   at
   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,
   Ms
   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
   stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
   length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top
   that
   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I
   wore
   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
   heel
   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
   When
   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
   "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
   husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take
   some
   pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
   was
   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
   she's
   back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll
   get
   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
   too.
   Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.
   All
   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
   independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break
   and
   new environment.

   Oh well, talk with you later!

   Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

      Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
      extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
   report
      card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
      sickness.
      I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
   she
      still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
      4th
      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
   in
      prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
   she's
      dumb
      and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
   letter
      last
      night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
      not.
      She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
   me
      so
      bad.

      Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
      best
      thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

      How's the school search going for Jordan?

Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class:

The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven

Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL

PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments

Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant)

Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area

For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies,  CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents.  The fuel is 2.67%

Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d

Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point

Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only

Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect

Lebanon - often constrained

Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7

Girl, that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned.  I have no idea, all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work.  I really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am.  I love the "hood" aspect of the neighborhood, I love the "colored" folks, and so on.  I need to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for.  All I know, is that I'm not getting any younger, and why not enjoy a new house now, what am I waiting for?  

Girl, I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well, but it has to be done!

Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m.  When I answered the phone, I recognized her voice immediately, and I got scared that something had happened.  That heifer called to tell me that Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft drink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find out what the heck Fruitopia meant)  and she wanted to check with me to see if that were true, because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class because it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one, that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass question.  You are the adult here, not Jordan!  She also said Jordan kind of smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously have no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant matter such as this.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!! 

Now on the other hand, Jordan will have to be punished for lying, but my goodness, can you believe it?

Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to be
EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't in
Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make you
feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?  I
was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang with
the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what all
the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving a
small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but Steve
asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much he
loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He also
apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know what.
He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to snuggle
up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He then
jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if he's
6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so just
go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't ask
where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
don't have time for his mess.

So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

Hey girl,

What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could
have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they
had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at
6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms
Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that
I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore
my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel
sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When
I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
"Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some
pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was
wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's
back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get
a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.
Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All
we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and
new environment.

Oh well, talk with you later!

Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

   Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
   extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her report
   card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
   sickness.
   I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but she
   still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
   4th
   grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up in
   prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that she's
   dumb
   and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a letter
   last
   night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
   not.
   She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt me
   so
   bad.

   Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
   best
   thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

   How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hi Pat,

I spoke with our attorney this afternoon, and he is in the process of contacting your attorney.  It appears that the bill of sale that your attorney had sent to Enron, did not specifically address the agreement that Enron and Heartland Steel entered into.  Long story, short, our attorney is following up with to obtain documents that contain this provision.

Thanks 

Hi Pat,

Just a note to recap our recent and ongoing discussions regarding the disposition of the Heartland Steel and CSN agreements:

At this point, Enron's Legal Department has requested documentation from CSN that substantiates the fact that CSN did purchase Heartland Steel.  I have contacted your legal counsel, Mr. Tarter, and obtained information that will hopefully satisfy Enron's request.  The next step for me is to meet with my legal staff on Monday, October 15, 2001 to determine the following:

1) Is the relationship between Heartland Steel and Enron completely severed?

2) Do we come up with a brand new pricing and deal structure with CSN, or does the existing structure with Heartland Steel remain in place?

Once, these determinations have been made, we'll follow up with the necessary legal documents.

I'm hoping to have resolution to these entire process by early next week.

Talk to you then.

P.S. As a notional indicator, November, 2001 pricing for Chicago city gate delivered volume (which is comparable to your location) would be estimated at NYMEX (currently $2.41) plus approximately $0.10.

Please keep in mind that the NYMEX price changes on a second-by-second basis, and this will impact your price.

Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

How was your weekend?

See ya!

Hi Patrice:

How are you today? I am wondering if you know who is over the PMO
department over there at Enron. My cousin in Austin received a phone from
them regarding employment and is curious about it.

Regards,
Hope

You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers.  How is everything going this morning?  What is your state of mind?  Are you feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive?  If you are feeling apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that you have, so that you don't waste your visit by being overcome by emotions.  Call me when you get back from your visit.  I will probably be leaving here around 2:00 or so.  Call me on my cell.

Love ya!

I will be leaving here at noon today.  Keep me in your prayers.

Hi Dave,

Please feel free to call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.

Thank you

 

Hey Missy,

Sorry we missed your call last night.  I was not home and Todd was up to his eyeballs in cleaning up a plumbing problem that we had and still have at our house.  Boy, was I glad I was gone last night.

Alice had invited me to go to a gala that her book club put on last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  They featured the poetry and readings of Thomas Melancon.  Have you hear of him, he was there, very good, although I am not a "poetry kinda sistah", but it doesn't cost much to be considerate and supportive of other folks' passion.  Anyway, it was sooooo much fun getting all dressed up, the attire was semi-formal.  When I got dressed and came out of the bedroom, Jordan goes "Oooohhhhh Mommy, Todd says nothing......needless to say Jordan made my evening.  He is really going to be the kind of guy that looks out for his Mom.

As far as Todd goes, I'm trying so hard, I remember you saying "be still" and I have been, but boy it gets hard sometimes.  Alot of times, I feel so confident about breaking out of my own, after all, it could not be much different.  Sometimes my mind says do it now, since the stock markets are down and I am broke at this time (laugh).  Anyway, I'm semi-cool.

What's up with you?  Any more phone calls from Mr. Yoga?  I heard it's supposed to be cool, weatherwise, for you guys over the next couple of days.  When I went over to your Dad's house, Nell said that you had your hard "pressed" for the wedding.  Are you still wearing it "pressed"?  You go girl!

See ya!
Girl..........YOU ARE CRAZY!------I laughed out loud at my desk when I read about your yoga instructor!!!!!!!!!!!

HAVE FUN GIRL!

LA YA!

Hi:

Sorry.  I got the message, but I've been running for the last week.  The divorce is almost final....I am DIVORCED !!!! YEAAAAAHHH.

I WON SOLE CUSTODY OF THE GIRLS ....YEAAAHHH.

But since Reggie is representing himself, after three hours, we ran out of time.  So we will resume the trial on 10/25, and we will argue over the value of the house, the stuff in the house, and decide how much I have to pay him.  You know I have every little receipt I could find so that it reduces this amount.  But, the final decision on division of the home is up to the judge.  The child support amount will be determined too.

It really doesn't matter, the judge wants the kids to be in the house, and the most important thing, is that I will make all parenting decisions with regard to the children.

Since then, it's been crazy at work, then I was on the program committee for the annual conference of a professional organization that I belong to.  The meeting was here in Chicago, so I spent the weekend and Mon and Tues. socializing with that group.

My "church" girlfriend stook me out for drinks last Friday, and I've been partying ever since.  Patrice, I didn't know how much of a burden that man was to me until that judge said "your divorced effective immediately".
I haven't been this happy since I was in college.

And guess what.....don't tell anyone, I haven't even told my sister or mother this....my yoga instructor asked me for my phone number on Saturday, and actually called me Sunday.  He's 41, divorced , has an undergraduate degree in biology and has the tightest ass you've ever seen.  But, he's short and has a gold tooth.....(and he probably really likes white girls).

that's enough for now.  I got to get some work done.  Talk with you soon.  Robyn

>>> <Patrice.L.Mims@enron.com> 10/11/01 12:20PM >>>

Hey girl,

How are you?  I hope everything is well with you and the girls.  I was
hoping to hear from you this past weekend.  We called and left a message
this past Sunday.  You've kinda got me worried.

I enjoyed visiting with Uncle Charlie and Nelle last week.  It was nice to
see Rayvn as well, she's so cute!  Thanks for the suggestion.  That worked
out well for me.

As for me, everything is going okay for me, I'm just in a mellow mood, just
hangin tough.

Write back!

   You sound good.  I'm glad you made it home safely.

   Here are the numbers:
   708-216-8395 (w)
   708-386-3558 (h)

   yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.
   Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not
   going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing
   money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were
   worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has
   two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA
   and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30
   hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got
   there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

   Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking
   until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

   Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good
   and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is
   questionable.

   I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

   I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

   One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to
   disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This
   will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

   Love, Robyn

   So good to hear from you!

   Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
   conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
   drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
   total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
   Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
   get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
   way.

   One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at
   the
   World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to
   be
   dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you
   ever
   think you would see this in your lifetime?

   Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".
   I
   will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first
   or
   second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do
   you
   do?

   How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

   I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
   wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
   roll....we can't wait around.

   Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received
   very
   good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
   class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

   Talk to you later!

   Love Patrice

   P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
   Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have
   them
   at all times, when I'm in the city.

Hi Bob,  

Per our conversation this a.m., here are the notional sales prices for Nicor City Gate deliveries for the following:

Five Year Price out of January, 2004	=	$3.67 estimate

Ten Year Price out  of January, 2004	=	$.3.92 estimate

(Please keep in mind that these are ESTIMATES!!)

If you need these prices further broken out by year, please call me.  I will also forward the ISDA and Long Term Gas Purchase Agreement to you early next week.

Thanks

Patrice

P.S. You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under,  is it Corn Products International?  Write back, because I need this information for the contracts, etc.

Hey patrice -

we will get you a price the Nov-Mar Trunkline STX later this morning.

Update:

I spoke with Jeff Hodge and was able to obtain a Bill of Sale document from CSN.  Jeff is currently reviewing this document and will let me know how to proceed.  

I'll let you know more when I hear back from Jeff.

Hey girl,

I don't know what in the heck I was talking about, Nicor Enerchange did send me the correct version.  Please review and let me know what you have for them.

Thanks,

Patrice

Hi Patrice,

I am attaching our comments (red-lined) to Enron's Master.  Please call once you've had a chance to review.  Thanks.

Hi Bob,

Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.

I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).

Year 2003			$.3.355

Year 2004			$3.45

Year 2005			$3.54

Year 2006			$3.62

Year 2007			$3.71

Year 2008			$3.81

As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.

Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.

P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.

Please reply when you have a moment.

Thanks

Did you know......The Royster Clark Nitrogen facility was originally built and constructed by Nicor Gas Company in an effort to stabilize pressure at the East Dubuque location of their system.  Royster Clark is currently listed as the largest industrial consumer of natural gas in Illinois, burning 30,000 MMBtu/d.

Quote of the Day:  There is no "I" in TEAMWORK.

Yes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you?  How are the proceedings coming along?

Everything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.

I've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?

By the way, has Marcus learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.

Write back!!!!

When this email reaches you, I pray that you are fine and well.  Just because I have not spoken to you, does not mean I don't MISS YOU.

VAL

Thanks so much!  What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron?

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.

I understand that you were out of the office on Friday, and I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will call you on Monday mid-morning.

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

fedexing 2 contracts today

John, are your responsibilities concerning Heartland Steel fulfulled if the contract is terminated?

Yes, we're getting paid--our payment for August gas came in under CSN. Why we're still able to supply them given the contract is terminated is my question. Wes Dempsey made it sound like a contract was being considered/negotiated and that we were in fact supplying them in the interim. CSN is upset that we are issuing bills to Heartland Steel, however, I am constrained to doing just that since there is no contract or counterparty in existence. Obviously we will continue in this manner until there's a counterparty and contract established. The only information I received from my contact at Heartland Steel, Carrie Allen, who is now at CSN is a number and name for the attorneys handling their bankruptcy. They are Alvarez & Marsal @ 212-759-4433 and she gave me the name TJ Schultz. I hope this information helps somewhat. Please let me know how to handle this customer...

Whoever is doing gas settlements should know whether we are getting paid.  The contract was terminated as of the date of the sale.  

Hey Guys,

I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Jimbo,  how are you?

You can tell that we're real busy at the present as evidenced by my timely response.  In answer to your question, we are still in a holding pattern.  We don't have much information, other that the same information that you see.  I would like to say yes, I have a new employer, but it seems a little too early as of yet.  Keep pulling for me, I need all the help I can get.

See ya!

So are you working for Netco now, part of UBS?

Hi Dave,

I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  

Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.

Thanks

Patrice

 

Good morning Rob,

Thanks so much, it's been a pleasure working with you.

I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!  (you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!  Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!  We've got much greater concerns right now!

Love ya!

P.S. I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available.

Well, Robin isn't pleased at all.  She thinks that he's extremely rude and
arrogant.  I have mixed emotions.  I enjoyed most of his songs, but I won't
like his style all the time.  There has to be a mix.

                    Patrice.L.Mims
Get our of here!!!!

That's so exciting, did they kick Dorian to the curb!  I like the
professionalism that the choir with achieve under Mike.  I'm excited!  How
do you feel about it,  how did Robin feel?  I know we'll be jamming!.  I
just hope we don't have to sing too many V. Michael McKay originals

Hi John,

Once again, so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.

We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.  I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.

Please call if you have further questions.

Thanks

 
  

Thanks so much.

This has been taken care of for you.

Lizzie,

We have a new customer that needs the billing and payment address and contacts for the new gas purchase and sales contract that we are working on.

Can you please em-mail that information to:

derek.ashing@auxsable.com 

when you have a minute.

Thank you very much

So sorry about that.....We do not have a date for you b/c the  contract does not exist as of yet.  Legal said that we could just end that sentence right after the word "transactions".  take out the language that says "including without limitation the Enfolio.......

Once you make that deletion, how long do you think it will take to have it executed and a copy faxed to me at 713-646-3390?

Thanks, we're almost there!!!!!!

Hi Vonda

Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece.
If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.

Enron offers the following:

Period:				November, 2001 - March, 2002

Region:				Trunkline South Texas Pool

Volume:			10,000 MMBtu/d

Demand Charge:		$0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times
				the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily
				basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.

Notification Time:		7:30 a.m. 

Thanks

Hi Vonda,

Here are the October offers for your consideration.

Thanks

 

Hey Lizzie,

That deal should have been booked to Nine Energy Services, LLC.  Can you please change that in Sitara.....thanks!

Good morning Elizabeth,

Would you please check with the trader on the above deal. I don't know why, but my contact at Detroit Edison swears this invoice is not there's. Please verify with the trader WHO this deal was done with. Then, the trader may have to call this woman over there or his/her contact at Detroit Edison to get this thing handled and paid.

Hey Rob,

Last time, one more change, if you will?

 I can agree to 7 business day with a revision to the proposed language in the second line to read as follows, " ... Guarantor shall pay the Obligations within 7 business days ....."

 Let me know if this goes?

Hey lady,

Does the below referenced language work for you?

Let me know.

Thanks

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   "must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . "
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

Girl, that's extremely reasonable!  I'll order mine early,  where are we purchasing them from?

P.S. Please send "Tarsha" a picture of my dress.  I think I accidentally deleted the picture of my dress, doggonit!  (You know I need to brush p on my e-mail skills.....they laugh at me all the time.)

You are a mess! That is a shawl sweetie not a bow :o) and it is priced at
$110. If purchased by October 31st, you will get 15% off.

I really hope that Jordan will want to do it :o)

Here is one picture of the bridesmaids dress. I am using two different
tops. Some of the girls will wear the one below and the other girls will
wear a strapless top. The color of them all are Rosebud. My sister will
wear a Rosebud lace outfit. They don't have a picture on the web of the
strapless top or my sister's dress but I can show it to you in a book. The
girls who are wearing the strapless top will also wear the same straight
skirt that is pictured. I am also attaching a picture of my mommy's dress.

(See attached file: bridesmaiddress.jpg)(See attached file:

Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go
to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is
that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the
dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about
the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will
be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain
everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as
well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!

P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!

   You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress
   but
   the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
   tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

   Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a
   girl
   and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question
   :o)
   Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
   talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to
   walk
   with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with
   the
   biggest smile on her face.

   Love ya!

Hey lady,

Does the below referenced language work for you?

Let me know.

Thanks

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

I'll probably be there at around 7:15  or earlier if I need to, what do you think about that time?

Hey girl!  Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  I was in
bed by 9:30.  Steve got home around 11:00 and didn't say a word to me.  He
turned on lights and made lots of noise, but said nothing.  He slept
upstairs in the game room last night, so evidentally, he goes in late
today.  He could've at least dressed and taken the kids to school, since I
do it every morning, but he didn't.  I can't worry about it.  I'm so use to
doing it all by myself anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  What time will
you be at rehearsal tonight?  Maybe we can talk before then.

Hope's number is (713) 207-7103.   Talk to you later!

Hey good morning,

How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane
Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is
Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it
better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.

Good morning Elizabeth,

Would you please check with the trader on the above deal. I don't know why, but my contact at Detroit Edison swears this invoice is not there's. Please verify with the trader WHO this deal was done with. Then, the trader may have to call this woman over there or his/her contact at Detroit Edison to get this thing handled and paid.

Hi Robyn,

How are you?  I hope everything is working out well for you.  I know you had to go back to court last week and I was wondering how that went for you.  Everything here is the same.  The boys are still being "the boys".  They're alot of fun.  Todd is still being Todd.  Although I must say, I think he's getting a little concerned regarding my somewhat "cavalier" attitude.  Nothing seems to really bother me that much any more, because I've made some resolutions in my own mind that work for me.  I guess I better start fussing at him more to get him back on track (not).

I thought for a moment that I might be visiting Chicago again real soon and even contemplated spending the weekend to do some shopping on Michigan Avenue, but I don't know now.  Our company, in case you haven't heard, is really going through.  Out senior management allegedly was involved in some "suspect" deals and joint ventures that have cost this company dearly.  We are suddenly finding ourselves going from hero to zero in a "heartbeat".  Last year around this time, Enron's stock was trading at $85 plus and right now our stock is trading at $11.29.  Just since news of this scandal came out a week and a half ago  (we took a $1 billion third quarter write-down), we've come down  from $30 to $11 (roughly speaking).  It hurts, and it appears that it's all because of 5 or 6 senior level executives.  If this company survives this, it will truly be a miracle.  Pray for me and pray for Enron.

How are the girls doing?  I know they're doing fine.  How's Cecelia?  Tell her we said hello.  How's Uncle Charlie?  Any word when Grandpa Thurston is moving down or is that still on hold?   I know Todd talks to Sherry alot, so I know she's doing fine.  How's the yoga instructor?

I attended the Harlem Dance Theater Production lasts Friday night with a girlfriend.  Interesting, although, I found out I really don't have an appreciation for that ballet "thang".  I was hoping for more "sho nuff" modern dance.  It was interesting, but now worth the $50 I spent.  My girlfriend and I went to a club afterwards....what an experience!  I'm glad I'm not into that scene anymore..rough life!  We stayed a couple of hours and came on home.

The same girlfriend kept the boys overnight on Saturday night and I actually had a free day to myself from about 3:30 that afternoon until I got out of church the next day.  Boy, what a good friend.  Todd was in Austin this weekend, so I was totally free.  I ended up shopping for an hour or so, and came home all excited about watching a good movie on Lifetime, and fell right to sleep.  Didn't wake up until 11:00 p.m.  Oh well, I enjoyed myself regardless.

Talk to you soon!

Love ya!
You sound good.  I'm glad you made it home safely.

Here are the numbers:
708-216-8395 (w)
708-386-3558 (h)
630-293-0293 (dad's)

yes the wedding was beautiful.  I didn't think it was going to happen.  Steve literally through a fit when it looked like his family was not going to make it. He wanted to postpone, Nell was concerned about losing money (girl...I was on Steve's side, and could not belief they were worried about the cost of flowers and the cake).......however, Steve has two blessings in his best men. He spoke with them  (one from Spokane,WA and the other from Montana.  They drove in to Chicago to be with him. 30 hours straight through. He was so happy on Saturday, because they got there in enough time to enjoy the city on Friday.

Everything else went off without a hitch, but Karen didn't stop shaking until they cut the cake. (I think she needed a cigarette).

Of course Jordan is doing well.....he's a Thurston, with all there good and bad traits.......intellect runs large, conduct however is questionable.

I hope Todd quickly sees that making a life together is the big payoff.

I'm attaching a special message, that I'll send to Todd separately.

One suggestion (if you don't mind),  come to an agreement on how to disciple the children. Kids will play you, even at Jordan's age.  This will drive a fatal stake in your relationship with Todd.

Love, Robyn

So good to hear from you!

Yes, I did drive back to Houston.  I was there on Monday, went to the
conference in Lincolnshire, went to dinner Monday night, got up Tuesday,
drove to the conference, and all hell broke loose at that point.  Total,
total chaos, I was so frightened.  The group said we're driving back to
Houston, once they announced that all airports were closed!  21 Hours to
get back, but I Thank God we made it back, and none of us were in harm's
way.

One of my close co-worker's father just happened to be in New York at the
World Trade Center for a meeting that Tuesday, and has been presumed to be
dead.  It is just a crying shame!  Also, the impending war.....did you ever
think you would see this in your lifetime?

Incidents of this kind really show you that"tomorrow's never promised".  I
will be back in the Chicago area real soon, more than likely the first or
second week in October.  I'm really skeptical about flying, but what do you
do?

How was the wedding?  I know it was beautiful!

I'm taking care of myself and living my life.  I do what I can, if Todd
wants to participate, I'm glad to have him, but if not, me and the boys
roll....we can't wait around.

Jordan seems to be getting his self together in school, he's received very
good conduct grades recently, and the teacher says he at the top of his
class, as long as he keeps the conduct grades up to snuff.

Talk to you later!

Love Patrice

P.S.  Please e-mail me your work, and home number, as well as Uncle
Charlie's...I need to program these into my cell phone, so that I have them
at all times, when I'm in the city.

   Hey:

   How are you?  I saw Lonnie at Karen's wedding.  He said you drove back
   to Houston.  I hope you are taking care of yourself. How are the boys?
   Love,
   Robyn

Got it!

Thanks

Hello Clark,

Pat Monahan of CSN asked me to forward the attached gas purchase contract to you for review.  We are currently scheduled to deliver natural gas volumes to CSN's Terre Haute facility for November 1st activity.  As a consequence, we would like to have your comments or approval as soon as possible.

My telephone number is 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.

Sorry for the rush!

Thank you

Thanks Ed,  I was visiting with Nicor and they talked about some deal on the electric side and they acted as though I knew about it....so I thought I would just inquire.  I'll give her a call.

Thanks

Terri Clynes is working with compression services (Jean Mrha's group) to convert compressors at one of Nicor's storage fields to  be electric driven. Terri can provide more info. on current status. Hope this helps.

Ed 

Are you going tonight?  I think I'm just going to go tomorrow.  What's happening?  What time is the shower on Saturday?

The number is 713-623-4893.

I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to look
up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go
together.

I'll let you know what I find out.

    -----Original Message-----
   Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after
   you.
   I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
   burning rubber.

   Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
   grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
   she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
   early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to
   pray
   for her.
   How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

   We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to
   Institute
   Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

   I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the
   problem
   was.

                       Patrice.L.Mims
   Hey Sister Sims,

   You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
   rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a
   hard
   time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need
   to
   look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

   How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going
   well
   for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for
   Jordan
   and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very
   immature.
   She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

   You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials
   and
   talk.

   Write back

      Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, "Wow"!!  It has to
   be
      EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo
   crazy.
      Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you
   weren't
      in
      Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it
   make
      you
      feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
      feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

      I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd
   call a
      plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

      I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on
   Sunday?
      I
      was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
      with
      the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
      Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
      all
      the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

      After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was
   giving
      a
      small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
      Steve
      asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how
   much
      he
      loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
      also
      apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to
   Siera
      for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way
   he
      treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her
   for
      speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I
   felt
      like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
      what.
      He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
      snuggle
      up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
      immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, "Why"!  He
      then
      jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
      he's
      6 yrs. old.  I said, "Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
      just
      go on & get out of here."  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
      ask
      where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just
   really
      don't have time for his mess.

      So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

                          Patrice.L.Mims
      Hey girl,

      What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
      could
      have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last
   night I
      had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
      they
      had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It
   was
      nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their
   at
      6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and
   seating
      at
      6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But,
   girl,
      Ms
      Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
      semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my
   favorite
      stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my
   floor
      length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The
   top
      that
      I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!
   I
      wore
      my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the
   ones I
      wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
      heel
      sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
      When
      I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
      "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
      husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan
   take
      some
      pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

      We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home,
   Todd
      said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
      entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

      Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
      was
      wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
      she's
      back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

      How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe
   we'll
      get
      a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be
   home
      until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to
   Power
      Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
      too.
      Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing
   much.
      All
      we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule
   different,
      independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean
   break
      and
      new environment.

      Oh well, talk with you later!

      Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

         Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've
   been
         extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
      report
         card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
         sickness.
         I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God,
   but
      she
         still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.
   The
         4th
         grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted
   up
      in
         prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
      she's
         dumb
         and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
      letter
         last
         night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because
   she's
         not.
         She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That
   hurt
      me
         so
         bad.

         Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.
   The
         best
         thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

         How's the school search going for Jordan?

Hey Lady,

I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

Hey Tricey!

I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been going
on? How are the boys?

Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but
she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you.
Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at
4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
address I have one for her too?

Girl, you know Tasha has no concept of time!!!!!!! (smile)

Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her
or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because she
had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a chance
to.

Royster Clarke

Thanks

LL,

In compliance with my 2001 Performance Plan, I have attached a "client landscape of potential customers" to be completed by November 1, 2001.

An action plan will follow within the next couple of weeks.

Please let me know if you have any comments.

Thanks

 

Hope,

I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

Hi Bob,

Per our conversation, here it is!!

 Here is a draft of the Master for Corn Products.

  

Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?  They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle is registered for?

Hey noonie!

I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her about
it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might have
to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there with
something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I have
all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

What is your favorite mascara?

      Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it
   to
      you.
      Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on
   Westheimer
      at
      4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
      address I have one for her too?

Hey Handsome Fellas!!!!

I'm thinking about coming up  to visit Nipsco next week.  Let's talk about a PLAN!!!

Please call when you guys have time.

Now what location of Vickie's secret are you talking about?  And give me an example of midday, evening or morning stuff?  You just lost me!

I love Clinique. I haven't tried their mascara but I've been using their
powder for about 3 years.

She is registered under Danielle Crusoe. Victoria doesn't have a registry
but when we went the manager let me write down all of the things that
Danielle wanted and she said that she would make sure that everyone in her
store knew about it for when people came in. I called it "Danielle Crusoe's
Wish List". I must give you the invitation. Her theme is "Around the
Clock". Have you been to this kind of shower before? It wear you bring a
gift that the bride-to-be will use during the morning, midday or evening
hours. I absolutely love during bridal showers they're so fun.

                    Patrice.L.Mims
Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?
They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle
is registered for?

   Hey noonie!

   I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
   invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her
   about
   it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
   places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might
   have
   to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there
   with
   something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I
   have
   all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

   What is your favorite mascara?

                       Patrice.L.Mims
   Hope,

   I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the
   Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her
   then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle
   registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church
   tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she
   registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for
   myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my
   favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

   Hugs

       -----Original Message-----
      Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5
      hours
      because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What
   subject
      is
      he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating
      just
      about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam,
      especially
      to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

      I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please
   tell
      her
      or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address
   because
      she
      had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a
      chance
      to.

      Smooches

                          Patrice.L.Mims
      Hey Lady,

      I just asked "Tarsha" about you the other day.  I hear you two have
   been
      shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
      Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are
   doing
      great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.
      I'm
      very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little "stinky".

      Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home,
      I'll
      call you if I do, or just call her for you.

      Talk with you later!!!

      Hugs

          -----Original Message-----
         Hey Tricey!

         I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has
   been
         going
         on? How are the boys?

         Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with
   Taylor
         yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

         Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on
      Tuesday
         but
         she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't
   either.
         Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give
   it
      to
         you.

   It was good to have you over on yesterday.  Really enjoyed it. (Smile)

Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help with the kids or anything.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

Yes, I will be at choir tonight.

See you then!

Un un, Stan's gotta barbeque!!!!!  That chicken was "da  bomb"!!!!

Hi Patrice,

I left you a voice mail earlier, but I wanted to send a spreadsheet so you can see what I'm looking at. 

Have the buyback prices been changed in Sitara? 
Which months are you going to change?
Is CSN going to be a prepay? If so, then I will add the Nov prepay to the invoice.

Please take a look at the invoice and let me know if you think this is what they're looking for.

By the way, I never got a chance to really thank you for bringing me along on the trip. I truly appreciate the learning experience and the chance to see firsthand how you interact with our clients. And it wouldn't have been quite as enjoyable with just anybody---you were great company! 

Thanks!

Cool!!!

we called you back but you weren't there.  Lets try to get together this afternoon.

Hey Handsome Fellas!!!!

I'm thinking about coming up  to visit Nipsco next week.  Let's talk about a PLAN!!!

Please call when you guys have time.

Just a FYI---Recent developments---there is a slim chance that you may here from Tony Conway or Donnell in the near future trying to be nosey about me and Lonnie...please keep everything on the downlow.  As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!  I'm a grown ass woman, dealing with this shit regarding someone who doesn't mean a damn thing to me.  (I hope I'm not too late!)

I hope we can roll tonight so I can fill you in, I have a 5:30 hair appointment, so I'll be leaving at 4:50 so let me know.

Hey Homie, 

   I got a funny feeling I will be working late tonight.  (Smile)

  Thanks for your help on yesterday.   

I'll give a hollar when I take my smoke break--what times are good for you?

I agree, BULLSHIT..............Even if I can't ride, which I hope I can....................I won't know until later..............I'll keep you informed.  Maybe we can take a smoke break today.  Just let me know when........................and of course.......................I ALWAYS KEEP THINGS ON THE DOWNLOW......................My house is clean now..... I don't talk to anyone...........and that's a good thing.  (Smile)

  Thanks for your help on yesterday.   

Girl, you're a mess!  Although, you are causing me to smile "in the midst of it all".  You really do need to find this guy.  What's his full name?  Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely, someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go, go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.  His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from this day forward.

I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.

With your knowledge, experience, and all those who know you, you would never have to worry about finding another job.  You might have to leave TEX.  But, mirant and elpaso is growing, just as well as AEP and Aquila.  There are a lot of rainbows on you side.  :)  By no means should you ever be worried.

You are so sweet!!!!  Thank you.

Are you on Enron's MSN Instant Messenger?  Will you be ready at 5 today?

Hi Patrice,

I know it's never going to be a good time to take care of this deal, but we've got to do it sometime. Let me know what time is good for you. Please let me know the payment terms of the new deal, so that I can get with the new coordinator of this account. More specifically, are they still prepaying??? Since the name changed to "c," I will no longer be handling it. Bummer, huh?

Thank you for the information.

Talk with you soon!

You may already know this, but I heard from guys at Nipsco that they did their first nom on Vector yesterday.  Also, Border interconnect expected Dec. 15th.  The heater hit a bridge so they are trying to do some field repairs. Not much else to report. 

Hey Louise,

How are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.  It was quite scary, but his spirits are high again and he seems to be making the adjustment.  

It means alot to me to get messages from you regarding my family's well-being.

Thanks again for your genuine concern!!!!  You're the best!

I understand your little boy had an accident.  I hope things are ok, family is always first - please take time off to make sure he's ok.

	Kaztex is saying that deal #1074625 should be at the flat gas daily price of $1.87, and that deal #1074647 should be at gas daily + 0.01 or $1.88.  Can you please either confirm that our prices are correct, or change them to match Kaztex's prices?  Please let me know as soon as possible - I need to get this finalized today.  Thank you!!!

Hi Debra,

Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".  Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.  I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.

I will be on vacation Tuesday and Wednesday,so I would appreicate your help.  As always, tomorrow I can be reached on my cell if you need me.  

Thanks

P.S. Did you get ahold of Mr. Hunt from Nicor yet.

Patrice, per our conversation.  Please look the attached over and give me a call.  Thanks,   Shirley

Hi Pat,

As we discussed the pricing for December, 2001 will be as follows (all prices are estimates at this time and will follow the direction of the NYMEX):

For Enron to perform full balancing, this means if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 2,000 MMBtu/d or if you nominate 1,000 MMBtu/d and you burn 500 MMBtu/d..... the price will be  an estimate of $3.10 per MMBtu for December, 2001

For Enron to perform the service, just as we are currently doing for November, 2001, whereby you buy or sell the difference at a Chicago Gas Daily price.....the sales price for a baseload quantity (you select your quantity up to 1,500 MMBtu/D) will be an estimate $2.85 per MMBtu/d.

As I stated above, all the prices listed above are estimates.  As of this date, Enron will need to receive a pre-pay on the above listed deals.

Please call so that we may discuss.

Thanks

P.S.  The burns are as follows:

Date		MMBtu/d

11-12		  581
11-13		1876
11-14		1287
11-15		1180
11-16		1038
11-17		  690

You are so nasty!!!!!!! Who is Henry (that get's on your nerves)? I can take a breather anytime now.  I have an 11:45 meeting today and then after that, it's just wait and see.   I am thrilled for you, you deserve everything you're receiving now and so much more!!! 

I too am very glad to be your friend...I only wished that we lived in the same city and could visit more often.  When God put us together, he knew what he was doing, AS ALWAYS!  

I love you my sister.

Also, you need to be careful on the e-mail and use code words, if you know what I mean.  You know I know how to READ!!!

Love ya!

I want to say that I am very thankful that the Lord has blessed you to be apart of my life.

Let me know what happens to you, on today.  You have soooooo much experience that you can go anywhere.  If I can be of some help let me know.

Patrice I really Love Ron.  My sister-in-law say my eyes were beaming.  I was a good girl.  Henry gets on my nerve sometimes.  I was running late this morning, therefore I did not have enough time this morning.  It would have been oooonnnnnn.  There is so much I would like to disclose to you on today.  I know other things are on your mind.  Let me know when you can take a breathier.  Your brother man is trying to act right, but, I am playing hard ball.  I need to go to Tex, and Denver.

Hey Lady,

How was your holiday and time off?  Hope everything is well with you!

Nicor is inquiring about their netting agreement, what is the status?

Thank you.

Hi Debra,

Nicor Gas Company wants to amend our base contract (their form of agreement) to add some "netting language".  Please review ASAP and let me know what you think.  I am most anxious to get this amendment reviewed, as this is our biggest LDC in the Midwest and they are continuing to do business with us, and have even sleeved some deals for us, when others would not sell to us.

I will be on vacation Tuesday and Wednesday,so I would appreicate your help.  As always, tomorrow I can be reached on my cell if you need me.  

Thanks

P.S. Did you get ahold of Mr. Hunt from Nicor yet.

Patrice, per our conversation.  Please look the attached over and give me a call.  Thanks,   Shirley

It s/b sitara # 695208.

I certainly will, I know you can't wait to go home and begin your life!!!!

Yes, We're going home to Omaha tomorrow morning, we'll be back on Monday.  Take care and Happy Easter!

Hey Lizzie

Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus $0.01.   I have revised both tickets.

Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla.

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.

See ya!

Hey Jimbo,

Good morning,

Will you please send me your address and fax number, we're going to try and get some contracts sent our sometime real soon.

Thanks

Since your old trading system was known as "EOL", can I assume the new
one will be known as "UBSOL"

I want to make sure we're on the same page concerning the Asset Management Deal.  Please review and let me know what you think! 

did you get the word from max that everything is cool to release the $?

Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

Hi Jordan,

Pam called this morning to inquire about the status of the above referenced amendment.  I apologize for the delay on Enron's part in sending this document.  It is my understanding that this is the same document that would be used for the Dynegy guarantee as well.

Please send me a red-lined version of any changes you have and I will personally make sure that legal responds immediately.

I can be reached at 713-853-5772 should you have further questions.

Thanks for your help!

 

 

Well, hell, I forgot the attachment!  Here it is........
 

Bobbi,

Here is the final for March, 2001, I'm preparing the April, 2001  sheet as well!

Val,

What is this e-mail about, did you mean to send it to me?  Send me some of those funny jokes that are going around.

Talk to ya later!

Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

What's Happening?

How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.

Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?

Talk with you later!

Please let me know why my VAR is $2.2 million.  My position is 108.3 short, so I need to know why the VAR is so large .  Hunter would like an answer as soon as psossible.

Thanks

 

Jesus,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.

Thanks

Please sign me up.

I did not realize there was a problem.  Pretty bad out there huh?  You really need to get a cell phone for bad weather, you could have been stranded.!

Glad you're there!

Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.

Talk with you later

Phillip.

The following four deals are the only ones that need to new mid for NBPL:

459238

606567

689712

68792

The rest of that list is misleading, etc. etc. etc.!

I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!

Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, socks, etc.)

Talk to ya!

I just called my other friend, her name is Renee Lewis and her home number is 281-484-2380.  She has sang the I Believe in You and Me song mnay times before at weddings and she is familar with Kissing You, but said its a really sexy song,  Have Barbara call her because she has alot of ideas.  She's a professional now and she can suggest all kinds of songs.  Take care!

Yes, she'snot familiar with the music, but said she would listen to the music and see what she thought, but I have put in a call to my other friend, but I know she would do it if her schedule was open, but she does is professionally, and I know there would be a charge,  I should hear something today from my other friend.

Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!

That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late night.  See you later

Daddy,

I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.  

I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!

Love Bernie!

Yolanda gave me the name of the songs--they are

"I Believe in You and Me" by Whitney Houston

and

"Kissing You" by Faith Evans

Yes, I'll ask her, but I also know someone else that sings at weddings professionally!  Do you know what song?

yes, yes, yes, looking forward to it!

Are you still available for lunch on  Monday?

Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!

Test message, I wrote up a whole e-mail and lost it,  my e-mail is acting up, so before I re-type this, I want to see if you get this!

Hey Bobbi,

Here is a revised nomination sheet for March, and also, I know you'll be shocked, but I sent the contract to the lawyers for approval, so we should get it back shortly!

See ya 

No---thank you.

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.  I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.
Hey girl!  Welcome back!  I had a great Easter with the exception of the
bad news I received late Sunday night.  My cousin (Renee') passed on Sunday
around noon.  She lived here in Houston.  Her husband gave her and her baby
AIDS.  Her husband died some years ago.  Her mom now has her little boy,
who is close to Siera in age.  My 2nd cousin (Kenny), who lives here in
Houston also, lost his wife on Sunday around 2:30 pm.  She was only 22
years old and they have a two year old daughter.  This situation is really
sad, because it stemed from a disagreement that was very petty.  The
Saturday before last, Kenny and his wife were on their way to Blockbuster.
They were arguing over Kenny buying a DVD player.  He stated that she was
selfish when it came down to him spending $, etc...  He told me that the
next thing he knew, she jumped out of the moving car.  He was going about
35 mph.  She had bad head injuries and underwent two surgeries.  She lived
a week and one day.  Her family is now blaming my cousin and they called
the police on him at the hospital.  The police had to escort my cousin and
his family to their cars because her family was trying to fight him.
Kenny's wife was responding when they brought her in to the hospital, and
the police asked her if Kenny pushed her out of the car and she said no.
It's a good thing they have this on record.

I will most definitely keep your father in my prayers.  I can't believe
he's lost that much weight.  He is blessed, and we're praying for God to
heal him.  We're praying for eternal remission right now in the name of
Jesus!  I know he was so happy to see you and his grandchildren.  You all
alone give him the strength to keep fighting.

Church service was good on Sunday.  Greg sho nuff preached!  However, the
choir didn't sound too good.  Doren was out sick, so Gerald had to play and
direct.  It was aweful.  We were all rocking different ways.  No, we did
not sing any of my songs.  I only made the 11:00 service.  Are you going to
rehearsal tonight?

Well, I did buy that cute dress from Lane Bryant with the shirt to match.
I also bought the green print skirt with the green solid shirt and the pink
solid shirt.  Honey, I was a fox in that dress at the wedding on Saturday.
I missed the wedding, but made the reception.  When I walked in the room,
all eyes were on me.  For once, I didn't feel self conscious about my arms.
My husband was all over me and giving me compliments.  Several of his
cousins told me how good I looked also.  Steve wasn't too pleased about
that.

Have you worn those capri pants and spaghetti top that you bought?

Hello,

How was your weekend?  My weekend was great visiting with my family.
Everyone is doing fine.   Daddy is doing okay.  The radiation treatments
put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer
would just move to another part of his body.  He thinks it may have moved
to his leg,  He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the
results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again.  He's has to
use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went
from 170 to l00.  It's really sad, he is so small and frail.  He's starting
to get his appetite back somewhat.  He sure had a good time eating this
weekend.  My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner.  Please keep him in
your prayers.  It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in
everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN!

How was church services on Sunday?  Did you make it to all the services, (I
don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's
a bit much).  Did Greg show out on Easter?  Anything new going on with the
choir, did you sing any of your songs.  This month is going to be extremely
busy with the revivial and the other church outing.

You know I never did get a  chance to ask you what all you ended up
purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.

Anyway, talk with you later!

I just spoke with Sharon Mahon and she asked me to tell you hello.  Did you know that she was expecting a baby girl in August?  She's five months pregnant and getting married on this Sunday to 
Tyrone.  Can you believe it?  She seem's happy.

Did Barbara ever talk with my friend about singing at the wedding?  What did she decide?

Talk with you later!

Good afternoon,

Robin called last night after I spoke with you and told me that her impress=
ion was that Rev. Jackson was resigning.  I called Horace this morning and =
asked him if he resigned and he said, Oh no, he had just made a mistake (I =
get the impression that Greg caught Horace dogging him out and called him o=
ut on him, and Horace being the good, honest person that he is, couldn't li=
e).  He said that it was his idea to get up and talk to the church.  Robin =
said he was just crying while he was talking.  He said he's in "time out" n=
ow.  I tried to ask him if Gregg put him in "time out" but he kind of kept =
talking.  He said he's really having family problems surrounding this churc=
h thing and he's just going to be sitting out for the next couple of weeks.=
  He won't be in the pulpit, he said Gregg would probably have him sitting =
with the deacons.  I asked him what is going on with the deacons,  and he s=
aid it would take all day to talk about that, and he had someone in his off=
ice.  I let him go after that.  Now isn't all of that interesting.  =20

I forgot to tell you that I spoke with Sharon Mayon on Friday.  She married=
 Tyrone this past Sunday. =20

That revival is this week isn't it?

Talk with you later!

Oh, Happy Birthday!  I'm so sorry I forgot to write it down.  I'll have to
take you to dinner.  I know you'll enjoy KiCi and Jo Jo.  I want to go!

I did not hear about Dana.  What's wrong?  What hospital?

Hmm, so you hooked Cynthia up with a customer.  Yeah, I hope he thinks
she's cute also.  She dresses nice and keeps herself well maintained, but
sometimes when I look her dead in the face, she's not the cutest person.
Keep me posted on that.

Well, have a great time tonight!  Happy Birthday again!!  By the way, how
old are you?

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.  

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates again.  

Talk with you later.

   

How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your job.  I
was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some of his
Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker than
teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take some
getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in when
we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is the
Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know
you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a
cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has
had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her
to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned,
we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.
Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have
dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll
try to call you on the way home.

See ya!

Our Michcon and Consumers Guy is iyt having a baby, so here's what he left me for Michcon and zero for Consumers. 

Yes, you may us me...are you going to have trouble getting home?  How much snow is on the ground now?

We are having a winter storm here today.  The apartment lady just called to
cancel until Saturday due to the weather.  Supposely we are  going to receive
another foot on tomorrow.  May I use you as reference?

Hi Darla, I've put in a call to Nicor.  The objective was to pay them $0.01 for the swap between Peoples and Nicor.  Thw other ticket involved is 664363.  If I'm not mistaken, I think we have accomplished that.  I'll let you know.

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

Darla, I spoke with Michelle at Nicor and I believe that everything is correct.  I corrected the tickets back on April 12, 2001.  Please let me know if this issue is settled or if we need to do more.  Thanks

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

Thanks

okay, how many people are you all expecting?  

Patrice, get with your folks you invited to the picnic and get a head count
of how many folks will attend.  We're trying to get a head count.  Sandie
will call you Friday or Saturday night.  This way we will know exactly how
to handle the food.

Kenny, is there a fee for reserving Tom Bass Park?  If so, how much and are we going to split the cost?

I believe that I will have approximately 15 guests..

Tasha & her family----4 people ( 2 kids)
Hope & family  ---  4 people (1 child)
Me and My family -- 4 people (2 kids)
Ora & family --- 3 people ( no kids)
Angie - possible 3 to 4 people (possible 2 kids)
Todd's friends from Dynegy - (2 adults)

Not as many as we originally thought, Sandie is calling folks the next
couple of days.  We invited about 5-6 families/friends, Marsha maybe
invited about the same. I know Todd had a couple of DYN folks.   When its
all said and done we may have about 40 people including kids.  I'll know
for sure Friday.  Mom and Jackie will be down that weekend so they will be
there.

Hello!

How are things going?  I'm pretty tired this morning, I went to get a relaxer last night and got there at 8p.m. and did not leave until 11:30p.m.--pretty exhausting, but Todd is out of town today and I wanted to squeeze that in before he left and I'd have to get a sitter.  

Anyway, is everthing going well with the house?  Hope so.....My daycare notified us yesterday morning when Todd dropped the kids off that they will be closing their doors permanently on June 1st.  Talk about not getting much notice.  Anyway, needless to say, that is my new crusade!  

Talk with you later!

Oh, Happy Birthday!  I'm so sorry I forgot to write it down.  I'll have to
take you to dinner.  I know you'll enjoy KiCi and Jo Jo.  I want to go!

I did not hear about Dana.  What's wrong?  What hospital?

Hmm, so you hooked Cynthia up with a customer.  Yeah, I hope he thinks
she's cute also.  She dresses nice and keeps herself well maintained, but
sometimes when I look her dead in the face, she's not the cutest person.
Keep me posted on that.

Well, have a great time tonight!  Happy Birthday again!!  By the way, how
old are you?

Hey what's Happening?

Just wanted to let you know that today is my Birthday!

We're going yo go to the KiCi and Jo Jo Concert tonight at the Arena
Theater,  should be very good!

Also, did you hear from Robin that Anna's daughter, Dana, is in the
hospital, I'm going to call up there this afternoon and see how she's
doing.  I'm assuming her last name is Brown.

Also, I hooked Cynthia Patterson up with one of my customers (A divorced
brother from S. Carolina).  Girlm she called me this morning, and she
was so giddy.  She said they really had a good time talking on the
phone, they talked two hours.  They are meeting for lunch on tomorrow.
I'll be anxious to hear what he thinks of her after meeting her.  I know
she'll like him, because he is a nice looking brother, and nice
conversation.  I just hope he thinks she's cute.

Oh well, talk to you later.

Patrice,

  Thank you for the time in answering some I'm sure some of
my questions were witless, but I'll assure you that I can
be articulate, give me alittle time.

If you could, please tell me is there a difference between
the execution of longer and short term contracts?

Answer:  They are generally the same; one of the major differences might be firm or interruptible.  The standard duration for a short term might be day to day or one month or less and the long term would be any trade over 30 days.  In an effort to get started, the ideal contract to utilize would be the "GISB" contract, which stands for Gas Industry Standard Board.  It's just a standard boiler plate contract that "the Board" (comprised of reps from various pipelines, marketing companies, LDC's etc.) put together.  It's widely accepted!  Just double-check on the firmess of the contract.

What is the usual process going from short to longer term
contracts?

Answer: There is no process, it just depends on what type of trade your end-use customer desires.

Can you describe to me in detail what a typical exemplary
trade is like?

Answer: A trade in which all facts/risks were clearly and accurately represented/communicated and the price is commensurate with the type of trade you are providing (i.e. firm or interruptible).

What is the problem that most marketers make with traders?

Answer: Misrepresentation, if you don't know and you are not sure, please communicate this to your potential buyer.  There is nothing wrong with arranging a conference call with you supplier and end-use customer.  We do it all the time, and we don't go around you.  Oftentimes, it gives the end-use customer a comfort level, that an experienced, reputable company is backing you. 

I appreciate your time and you tell me when it's a good
time to go to dinner.

Answer: I'll have to let you know,take care!

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks

Got it, let's talk tonight.  What time is good to call you? or you give me a call!

I appreciate all that you have done.  There are 7 days remaining.  I wish I
was leaving tomorrow.  I miss him dearly.  Three to four years is going to be
a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my daughters
would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let her
know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that is
not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not move
until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I would be
set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last night
and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the lady on
today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all goes
well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head up
about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with him
personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

>>> Patrice.L.Mims@enron.com 01/30 1:01 PM >>>
Hey "G",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse
and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this
afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's
on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me,
I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this
stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its
hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

   When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was
   your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with
   mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this
   week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of
   us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there
   before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went
   in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.
   I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem
   evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
   him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive
   a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

   VAL

would it be possible to leave it on ENA paper, it seems that would be the easiest

Patrice/Geoff, How do you guys want to handle the contract with this customer?  Will he stay on ENA paper or do we, EES, send him a new contract?  I need these answers today because the customer will be moved an EES pool today for June 1.

I would also like to see the contract you guys have with them so I can understand what obligations I would owe them.

Thanks,
Jesus

Dan Hyvl went back to the original trader and wants to double-check, but it seems pretty likely that everything needs to be done under Crestar.  Hold tight!

Yes, your correct, I'm sure that we are going to have the same issue.  I'm still waiting for the lawyer to respond back to me.  I know he had to contact the Calgary trader to get a resolution.  I'll contact him again today and will let you know what he says.  Thanks for reminding me again!

Just wanted to keep on top of this...

We are getting ready to settle Apr-01 production and I believe that we might have the same issue.

Here is my best attempt at month-to-date volumes, holler if you strongly disagree!

 

Hi, 

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.  

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear my
schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.  The
visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how to
use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all of
us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern that
is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back over
there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on May
31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there and
keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a hard
time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about it, I
would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed fine
last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up to
him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's boss
and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we wondered
about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned) if he
does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all are.
It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
Talk with you later.

Hey girl,

Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to
say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to
seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little
bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the
concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several
acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15
p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates
again.

Talk with you later.

   How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your
   job.  I
   was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

   I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some of
   his
   Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker
   than
   teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take some
   getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
   I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in
   when
   we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is
   the
   Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

   Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know
   you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a
   cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina
   has
   had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want
   her
   to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned,
   we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams,
   etc.
   Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have
   dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so
   I'll
   try to call you on the way home.

   See ya!

Hi Lizzie,

Will you please call this lady at TransCanada, Tracy in Gas Accounting at 402-505-8800.  She says we have a couple of term deals that have the incorrect TransCanada counterparty.  They are not deals in my region, so I thought it best to have you handle, as opposed to passing her around..

Thanks

That's fine, but I think I got off kinda cheap, so let me know if I need to contribute more!  It was so much fun!

Cost

Patrice        $70.00
KC        $0
Marsha         318.00

Total          $318.00

Collected $136.00

Balance   $182.00

Divided by 3   $84.00 each

*I was supposed to pay for the meat at Sams, but since I wasn't a member I
couldn't pay so Marsha paid for the meat.
I gave Marsha the $136.00 I collected plus my $84.00 plus $14.00 (your part
of the  $84.00 Patrice) .  You don't have to pay anything, the $70.00 you
paid for food is your cost.  I know we all ended up probably paying a
little more than we anticipated once you add it all up, but after it all
was said and done, I think EVERYONE had a great time!!

Hi Liz,

Thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline.  This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information.  Also could you please add Lisa Kinsey and Mark Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas.  One last request, could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations.

Thanks again.

I called you back at 10:31, i'll try again in about 15/20 minutes.  You should carry your cell phone in your purse in case you need to call me.  Then you van hang up and I'll call you right back!

Bernie, call me as soon as you can. I am trying to make flight arrangements
for San Antonio and I have a question for you.

Hi,

I need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on
Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or
so and come on through to Omaha.

I'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had
to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some
nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you
stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like
Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom
yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how
everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad
shape.

I asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not
ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and
not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of
pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so
hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is
any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's
certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if
there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying
for Daddy as well as Mom.

If there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.

Talk with you later!

   Hey girl, what's going on?  When are you going to be here so I can clear
   my
   schedule.  I have graduation tonight so I will probably be home late.
   The
   visiting nurse came out last night to check on daddy and to explain how
   to
   use the feeding tube. I went over there around 9:00p.m. from church.
   After she fed daddy thru the tube, he upchuck again.  So this tells all
   of
   us that the feeding tube is not going to do the job.   The main concern
   that
   is being expressed by everyone is we have to find some way to stop the
   vomiting.  The Hospice nurse will be out today at 4:00 and I go back
   over
   there to hear what they have to say.  Daddy goes to the new doctors on
   May
   31.  The main concern is the vomiting.  We just have to hang in there
   and
   keep praying.  After my doctor's visit with Daddy on Thursday, I had a
   hard
   time dealing with it on Friday.  Everytime someone would ask me about
   it, I
   would start crying.  I am doing better today and daddy's spirit seemed
   fine
   last night.  I told Junior about the nurses on Saturday and I left it up
   to
   him to talk with Corey.  The next thing I need to do is call Daddy's
   boss
   and ask him about his retirement.  Even though he is eligible, he is not
   ready to take that final step.  when junior and I were talking, we
   wondered
   about what would happen to the retirement (as far as Mom is concerned)
   if he
   does not officially retire?   Daddy is still very optimistic as we all
   are.
   It is very important that his attitude stays positive.  Enough for now.
   Talk with you later.

   Hey girl,

   Sorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So
   little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to
   say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to Teena
   yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.

   I spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop
   trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he
   will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to
   concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going
   to
   seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and
   fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was
   hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little
   bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.

   The concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However,
   the
   concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had
   several
   acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until
   1:15
   p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The Hilton
   Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that
   dates
   again.

   Talk with you later.

      How come I have not had a response from you?  You better get on your
      job.  I
      was beginning to wonder if you were on vacation or something.

      I saw "little" Corey last night for the first time.  You can see some
   of
      his
      Indian heritage.  His hair is hair is very straight and he is darker
      than
      teena.  It was so weird calling him Corey.  That is going to take
   some
      getting use to for me.  Teena told me that you called her yesterday.
      I finally got the name of the hotel that the choir will be staying in
      when
      we arrive in houston on 6/27 & 6/28.  It is not embassy suite.  It is
      the
      Hilton Houston Southwest.  Where is that in relations to you?

      Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I
   know
      you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll
   hail a
      cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina
      has
      had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want
      her
      to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is
   concerned,
      we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams,
      etc.
      Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have
      dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so
      I'll
      try to call you on the way home.

      See ya!

I just found out we have a toll free number 1-800 97ENRON, they tell me you have to select the Enron Bldg and my extension is 5772!

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 

Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power

No, I didn't make the party.  I just kind of fizzled out!  Anyway, hope you're feeling better and hope we can roll today so we can catch up chile!

I'll call before I leave.

Good Afternoon Ms. Thurston!!	

   Did you make Tony's party????  I hope you did..........I've gotten several calls from Donnell, however, I was a little under the weather over the holiday and still not doing so great.  I had to cancel my dental appointment today, because I'm sure they won't give me the premeds.  They confirmed when I called.  Anywho, I left your home number with Donnell to call you and give you Tony's home number.

Anywho, I hope you and the kids had a great time over the holiday.  I finally left the house on yesterday to go with Stan to visit his parents.  He had to go to work, therefore I was stuck a little longer than I would have wanted to, we played cards so that helped me a lot.

Anywho, I'm working on performance reviews, not sure what time I'm leaving today, but do call.

See Ya!!

Yes, I thought we had sent you the contract already.  The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates, and not specifically Peoples or Nicor, if I'm not mistaken.  Is this going to be a problem?  I'm sorry, I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!!!

Patrice, Have you had a chance to locate the Cargill contract?

We need to get together to discuss how our desk can help you on a day to day basis since we are now EWS.  

So sorry everyone, I inadvertently sent you prices from the May 1, 2001 model.  Thanks for your patience!!!

 

Please prepare a wire transfer to Crestar in the amount of $873,572 for the above referenced time period. This wire transfer should be made effective June 1, 2001.

Thank you for your help!

Hi Lizzie,

Will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st.  The sitara ticket Number is 761773.  

I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on (a good deal for Enron), so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period.  So as a result, to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations, would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations?

If not, no big deal, it would just make less work for everyone concerned.

Thanks

Hey Jimbo,

I will be on vacation that entire week.  Sorry!  It's so funny, I never take vacation and the one week that I do, that's when I'll be gone.  Anyway, you can have my space!

I am scheduled to come on Jun 12 through 14.  I wanted to make sure you two will be there and to be sure there is space.

Let me know

Hello,

Tasha told me that you just got back from your trip abroad.  Was is just Fantastic! (smile).  Any brotha's and sistah's over there?  Hope you had a great time.    I would love to see pictures sometime.  I would like to purchase some of that eyeshadow base.  I think it is the triple action cream or something like that.  It has the gold cap to it.  Also, I would like some black eyeliner.  Just call me whenever you have it.  Also, I'd like some of that "Stress Free" cologne from the Private Spa collection.

Just let me know when you have it.  

Thanks!

Guess what, i will be on vacation starting next monday for a week.  Maybe we can hook up this weekend?

I have the eye creme and the eye liner.  However, I will be out of the office until Monday.  So I will bring it then.  Also, I will see if I can get the stress free cologne.  I don't have that.

Per Your Request:

Average Monthly Temperature - Basis Normal:

May 2000:  +3.1
May 2001:  +1.1

From a demand standpoint:
 - May 2000 - Heating Demand:  There were 13 days with a minimum temperature below 50, 6 days below 45 and no days with a minimum below 40.  There was 1 day with a maximum temperature below 50: May 19th featured a maximum temperature of 48 degrees.  The lowest maximum temperature was 48 degrees on the 19th and the lowest minimum temperature was 40 set on the 14th.  There were no periods during the month where the minimum temperature dropped below 45 degrees for 3 or more consecutive days.
- May 2000 - Cooling Demand: There were 8 days with a maximum temperature 80 or higher.  3 days reached maximum temperature 85 or higher.  The warmest maximum temperature was 86 degrees on May 6th.  There was one stretch of 3 consecutive days where temperatures were 80 or higher - May 4, 5, and 6.

- May 2001 - Heating Demand:  There were 17 days with a minimum temperature below 50, 9 days below 45, and 3 days below 40.  The lowest minimum temperature in the month was 37 on the 13th and lowest maximum temperature was 57 on the 12th and the 27th.  There were two stretches of 3 or more consecutive days with minimum temperatures below 45 - May 11, 12, 13, 14 and May 23, 24, 25, 26.
- May 2001 - Cooling Demand:  There were 8 days with a maximum temperature of 80 or higher.  4 days reached a maximum temperature of 85 or higher.  The warmest maximum temperature was 89 on the 16th.  There were two stretches of 3 or more consecutive with maximums 80 or higher - May 1, 2, 3 and May 15, 16, 17.  May 15, 16, 17 each featured temperatures of 85 or warmer.

Comment:  I think that May of 2001 should have prompted more overall demand than May of 2000 based on the more extreme nature of heat and cool. 

June 2000:  -1.3
June 2001:  To Date: -11.1
                        Forecast for the month:  -3 to -6

From a demand standpoint:
- June of 2000 - Heating Demand:  There were 4 days with a minimum temperature below 50 and no days below 45.  The lowest minimum temperature was 45 on June 3, 5, 6.  One period during the month featured 3 or more days with a minimum temperature below 50; June 5, 6, and 7.
- June of 2000 - Cooling Demand:  There were 12 days with maximum temperatures 80 or higher.  5 days reached 85 or higher.  No days over 90.  The warmest maximum temperature was 89 on June 8.  There was one stretch with 3 or more consecutive days over 80, June 8, 9, 10, 11.  This stretch also featured 3 consecutive days over 85.

- June of 2001 - Heating Demand:  To date:   There have been 5 days with a minimum temperature below 50 and no days below 45.  June 3, 4, and 5 were consecutively below 50 for minimum temperatures.  Forecast:  The forecast through June is likely to bring at least 3 and as many as 6 more days with minimum temperatures below 50.
- June of 2001 - Cooling Demand:  To date:  No days 80 or higher.  Forecast:  June 7 through 20 will likely bring fewer than 4 days with a maximum temperature over 80 and 2 or fewer days over 85.  No days are expected to top 90 before June 20.  No stretches of 3 or more consecutive days over 85 are expected before the 20th.  Long range forecasts would indicate that it is unlikely that any significant stretches of heat will impact Chicago through the end of June.

Comment:  With below to much below normal temperatures continuing for much of June 2001 - cooling load will be less than June of 2000.  I'm not sure exactly how much the increased heating load will off-set the total monthly demand.

Let me know if I can help more...

Looks like your Harvard team pulled it off! I know you must be excited about the team. What a great season. Hope you have a good thanksgiving. Kate and I going to OKC and to an OU football game. Take care.
Matt

Thanks for the Dog Bat Matt.  He is still chewing on it today -- sign of a
great gift.

Spoke with Dylan a while back and said he took a job with you. Sounds great! He is a great guy and will do well there as you already know. I am off to Mexico for a few weeks starting saturday and will call yo when I resurface in a month or so. Hope all is well.

I sent this last week but was to the wrong address. Hope all is well.

Brian,
Hi. Hope things are well with you. I wanted to drop a line and say hello as well as to thank you for your extreme generosity   with respect to our wedding. I am humbled by what you are doing for us and know Kate feels the same. I am looking forward to September and know that all will have a great time!
Kate and I are going to CT and NY next week to find a place to live (hopefully). We are planning on renting initially then look to buy later. Real estate is crazy there. I guess it is not much better where you are though. Take care.

Harvey,
Hi. Hope things are going well for you in Europe. I was going through some old emails and ran across this one and thought I'd drop you a line. How is the family settling in and how is the job going? Things are fine here. I turned down a job with UBS and am waiting for my contract to expire. I will be glad when this whole Enron chapter is closed in my life. I'm sure everyone will. Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know how things are going for you. Take care.

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards

(If you're not planning on going camping this weekend, please disregard
this memo.)

The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by
scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go
camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B:

The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a
caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there
around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later),
information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under
"Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher".  Depending on the outcome of the game
Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close
to your phones.

As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night (
hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a
burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will
also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever
snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff
(optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra
tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to
the park, call Butch (professional mover).

Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan):

From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed
South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15
miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance.

From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or
FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the
Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right.

Yah-teh-hay!

please add to my schedule.

The guy in B.A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 
14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 
minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's 
name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights 
lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We 
aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. 
shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of 
fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the 
heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from 
Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour.

You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated 
with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful.  
Don't hesitate
to call if have nay questions.  

I talked to Scott Neal - he lived in BA for a few years and has attended and
hosted bird hunts.  He is going to get me the names of some people he hunted
with to compare prices, accommodations etc.  A few things he wanted us to
check on;
 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class?
 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times.
Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much
shooting (and then some) as he needed.
 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.  Again he is going to verify and
get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting
(not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he
stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons.
I will get back to you with more details as I have them.
Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com)
Are you up for a hunting trip of a lifetime?

Pawpaw and I met with an outfitter last week to discuss details of a dove
hunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshell, the trip includes six (6) shoots
(i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody can
attest, there is no limit and you can shoot 400 to 1000 birds per day
depending on how mad you are at them!

I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includes
the following:

3 nights & 4 days (6 shoots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia)
Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be as
low as $800)
Shells ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shoot...75% kill
average)
Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705

We need at least 4 to book a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are opposite
from ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smaller group will
be booked to go with an other group.

I know all of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 large
for a trip like this?

Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start looking
at dates. If you have any questions call Pawpaw or myself. See ya.

please forward to everyone on the East Desk.
thanks,
scott

Due to credit exposure to Mieco, we have shut them down for trades, with the 
exception of physical gas purchases.  We need to notify the gas desk to 
purchase daily physical gas at index to help offset our exposures (ENA 
purchases only).  Please call your respective trade desks (gas, power, crude, 
coal, weather, etc).

I really don't have a clue.  However,it seems that most of the costs are

I'm working with some guys that are trying to build out some software to
improve back office efficiencies...do you have any good reference points for
back office costs in power trading on a $/Mwhr basis?

I figure it is  bit busy at the moment and will call you this afternoon to
follow up...

Thanks, Lynn Bourdon

pay only the $1750 referenced below to Robin Barbie from my book. 
	
	

as i discussed today listed below is the trade that i would like orgination 
granted on and a summary of the other 
deal i spoke with you about.

bought 5000 dracut from hydroquebec sitara deal number 610884  purchase price 
$6.10 
sold      5000 dracut from conn nat           sitara deal number 610959   
sell price            $6.45
                                                                       
orgination  $1750

additionally on a daily basis i attempt  to market  the tenn zone 5 above the 
cng bid.
usually with success.
the production costs roughly 28 cents at current prices to move to cng.
today the cng two way  was 6.51 by 6.55.  i sold 5800  at $6.48 which is a 
$6.76 cng equivalent or
.25 over the cng bid   or $1450   

i can't try to forward sell this gas because we don't know on a forward basis 
if we are going to have this gas.
i assume that this position would go into the cng position when the books are 
broken out and i can't imagine that
scott will have the time try to market it.  thus if i am spending a 
considerable amount of time in the morning trying to add 
value to the desk with the illiquid assets that we have and i am successful, 
then i feel that signficant quantifiable contributions 
made to the desk should be recognized.

please pay this origination from my book to Robin.
	
	

today i did an intraday deal between hydroquebec and connecticut natural

i bought 4000 of dracut from Hyrdoquebec @ $5.65  sitara deal number 618541
i sold it to connecticut natural at their gate @ $6.03 via unutilized 
intraday capacity  sitara deal 618626

the capacity costs are $0.09.  orgination should be granted on 
$6.03-.09=$5.94 equivalent at dracut.

or $5.94-5.65=.29 on 4000 mmbtu = $1,160

also i haven't seen the orgination on the feb8 transaction per my previous 
email

thanks,
robin

I moved to SP 10 days ago. Very exiting city, don't you think so? Not many 
places to play golf here, but I will have to look better. Are you playing??
How are things going there? How is your desk doing this year? Things are 
difficult in the region - I believe you are aware of it - but as usual, we 
are trying hard.

Well, just wanted to let you know thta I am in SP now, working for Remi

Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and
who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state
park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr
away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other
commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!

To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park
Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down
there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be
at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are
bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys
playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER
SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND
BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate
headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting
your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer
(or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery
tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be
provided next week.

Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,
flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.
Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the
final call on that by Thursday.

To date, below is the headcount:

          Friday Night   Saturday Night

Fallick        ?         ?

Hello Scott,

I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active 
contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file 
containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas 
Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 
9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract 
Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both 
of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a 
letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement 
to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the 
term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the 
file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts.

Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

(besitos)

Thank you for the info.  I call if I have questions after I review further.

   

Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.  
There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about 
financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a 
forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against 
them too much.

Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to 
maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first 
come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas 
trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a 
fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their 
transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  

The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so 
Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report 
its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, 
have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases 
they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate 
for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue 
could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for 
system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed 
in the next rate case.

As you know, Mog has been selected for the trading track program.  Her 
initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up 
rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial 
trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be 
supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per 
Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity 
hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her 
trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then 
proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of 
you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato 
asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided 
those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group 
would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be 
very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not 
receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed 
ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation.

please add to my schedule.

on January 25, 2001.  The latest appointment in the evening will work if it 
is at all possible for Scott to meet during that time.  If I can even get 30 
minutes I would be greatly indebted to you and Scott forever.  If not, is 
there anyone else on the trading floor able to give me some time.

Please advise as soon as possible?

Thanks, Geynille

I have a seat for Frank and I am working on Gil and the rest of those guys.  
Ina is out until Thursday, but I will be giving her a call at home this 
morning to see what can be done.  I will coordinate the move as  soon as I 
have a space.  Meanwhile, I am checking with the guys periodically to meet 
their needs while they are on the 31st floor.  Call me if you have any 
further questions x35193.

agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00

Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks

I would like Joe Casas (currently East logistics) to participate in the 
interview process.
We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  
If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and 
associates arrive and do a session then.

before this memo goes out - please advise.

Please keep this note confidential until release.

Scott,

Find attached my resume as we had arranged yesterday.
I you believe that I should be there the sooner the better I'll reschedule my 
vacations so as to be there on the first of January, if you believe arriving 
there on January 9 or 10 is OK I'll do that.
Probably on the first week of January people wont be at the office from their 
holyday season.???

Thanks buddy I appreciate your help. 

Great.  I look forward to seeing you.  Feliz Navidad!

Pablo Acevedo @ ENRON   12/15/2000 11:01 AM

Scott,
I will be in Houston in Jan 10th onwards. Will be calling you. Hope we can 
work something out up there. I am planing to do a US road show. 

Saludos y abrazo.

Merry Christmas to you and your family.  We had a great time this football

Please note that as of Wednesday, December 13, Gas Daily will begin 
publishing an Electronic Trading Index for the gas market. We will be 
contributing to this index, which will show prices similar to those currently 
available in the EnronOnline Content section under "EnronOnline Price 
Reports".

If you or others in your organization get questions from customers or media, 
please refer to the following points regarding the message we're trying to 
promote:
An increasing number of transactions done online are proving the 
"staying-power" of the platforms and are legitimizing transaction data from 
them.
Ideally, these numbers should be audited before being given to the 
publications so as to minimize reporting errors.  EnronOnline's numbers are 
audited by Arthur Andersen on a periodic basis.
An increased participation from the other platforms will allow these indices 
gain more credibility/appeal and encourage customers to settle on them.

Please forward this email to appropriate people in your dept.

If you have any questions on the above, please contact Rahil Jafry on 33206.

Thanks,

Dave

we had a good day.

i heard the gas desk made $400 million yesterday. True?

Rolo

713 503 3466 is the correct number.  Have a great day.

Scott:

I just got a new cell phone, and I'm entering everyone's numbers.  I realize
that I have two cell numbers for you:  713-503-3466 and 713-203-4029.  Is
one of these Carol's, or is it an old number?

you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The

it and in the required format.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George:

Scott Neal gave me the following quotes for your December only volumes:

Transco Zn3 WH: Index +.01 minus IT feeder to Ste. 65

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able 
to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas  and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to 
grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical 
emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had 
hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating 
plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an 
electrical problem and into  a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and  electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants 
and  transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, 
chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  
organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. "You  
can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  
of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. 
In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural 
gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are 
generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  
some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. 
But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution 
when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that 
power  plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was 
short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, 
including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now 
undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough 
to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers 
and  not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard 
last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic 
feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% 
less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million 
British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are 
down about 8% from a year  ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said  
High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. 
In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times 
the price a  year earlier. 

Let's set up a meeting to discuss.  The Wellhead Group is responsible for 
everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, 
operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd 
Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool.

George, Could you please answer a few preliminary operational questions 
before we proceed..
Has Scott Neal approved this for our desk (assuming risk and swings)?  Is our 
logistics group nominating, scheduling, confirming and balancing this 
wellhead?   Are we buying from you or are we buying from Cabot??? Who's 
responsible for deal entry and management in Sitara? Who's responsible for 
notifying us of changes?  Do we need to acquire transport for this or is it 
moved IT (Transco charges for pool receipts)
Operationally we need as much lead time to submit timely noms daily and at 
the first of every month.  We would like changes/swings to be communicated 
via e-mail, fax if necessary and followed by phone call to ascertain 
receipt.... 
Once we have some of these questions answered we can talk details....
Thanks

Shawna, as we discussed, please adjust the pricing provision of the two (2) 
Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation gas purchase agreements to provide for 
the following:  on a daily basis, we will pay index minus $0.005 for the 
first 80% of the gas produced that day and gas daily minus $0.005 for the 
remaining 20% of the gas produced that day.  I believe this pricing mechanism 
roughly approximates the Kerr McGee pricing provision you recently prepared 
for Brian Riley at meter 6884.

Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
system? 

   

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central 
gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.

Thanks,

Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing 
mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well.  
He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of 
commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would 
recommend him highly.

yes i want to contribute, and thank you for doing this.

   

I picked out two kids today for our group.  I will be collecting money for 
christmas gifts for the kids through next Wednesday.  Please let me know if 
you would like to make a donation.  Last year we gave $20 each.

Dear Wildcats:

What a great game you guys had against the Titans!  The team party at
Speedy's was great - a special thanks to Mrs. Burge and Mrs. Gwydir for
organizing the event.

For this week, I spoke to the Commissioner this morning and he stated our
Tully Bowl Game is "95%  sure for Sunday, November 19, 2:00pm".  If this
is so,
I would like everyone to report at 1:00pm.

Here is the balance of the schedule for the week:

Wednesday, Nov. 15 - Practice 4:30-6:00pm
Thursday, Nov. 16 - Backfield only - no pads - 5:15-6:00
Saturday, Nov. 18 - Practice 9:00-11:00am

Special note: Do not wear your football cleats to the Tully Bowl - They
don't
work on the Astro Turf - WEAR TENNIS SHOES ON SUNDAY!

Lets work hard this week  and Beat The Mustangs!
Go Wildcats!

I will correct the spelling and forward the letter to you tomorrow.

Scott:

This is very kind of you and I really appreciate it very much.  I shall phone 
you to thank you on behalf of my family and myself as a stop gap measure till 
I am back from India by 1st week of December to thank you in person.

The lawyer has asked me to compile all the letters, thus kindly send it by 
internal mail to Amr Ibrahim, EB4737B.  Finally, strange as it might sound, 
the lawyer has spelled my first name in the letter wrongly as "Amir", and I 
wonder if there is still time to correct it to "Amr" without the "i".  If 
this is a bit late, then it is fine as it stands.  

Once more, thank you very, and I really appreciate it.

Very best regards

I have prepared  a recommendation letter as  you have requested.  It is my 
pleasure to do so.  Please advise as to when to send, etc.  I am available to 
visit on the phone any time after 2:3opm any day this week.  However, I will 
be out of the office on Thursday and Friday Nov. 16-17.

Scott:

I hope that all is well.  India is still going strong with additional 
involvement in commodity trading (electricity, fuels...etc.)  

Please advice of the best time to phone you this week to seek your help in 
reference to compiling letters of recommendation for the Green Card 
application.  The application, supported by Enron, will be under the "Alien 
of Extraordinary Ability" Category.   I am sure that your recommendation will 
go a very long way and I am hopeful that you will agree to help.  

I am enclosing the email I received from the lawyer and the sample letter 
suggested. I am trying to highlight--where the lawyer indicated--the attempts 
to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,  the rapport I had with 
the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on 
character and ability.  Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and 
advice of any comments and/or suggestions.    

Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and 
advice.

John/Dave,

Frank and I would like to recommend assigning Phil Demoes outside of our new 
group as part of the upcoming reorganization.
Please let us know if you would like to discuss further and how we should 
proceed.  
Frank W Vickers
10/23/2000 09:56 AM
Scott, hope all is well.  I will get to the point.  What are your suggestions 
on the individuals that we have been assigned ?  I need to rely on you for 
any input that might suggest that we not take someone on.  I understand that 
Dave wants any personel changes as soon as possible.  What do you think ?  We 
do not want to begin with HR problems if we can avoid it upfront.

Please e-mail or call at 503-464-3940.

Frank

i think gil muhl wants to meet with us on Monday at 4pm to discuss PSEG.  he  
will let us know monday morning.

please print the attached letter on my letterhead.  thank you.

Suggestions for offsite:

1)  Non Enron speakers/presenters
2)  Cabo San Lucas, The Biltmore in Coral Gables,FL, The Broadmoor in 
Colorado Springs

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Haven't forgot about you yet.  I will have the information for you this 
week.  Thank you for your persistence and 
patience.

Sincerely,

Scott

 Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who
would be contacting me had my email address.  It is cgraeter@tamu.edu.  I
know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.

Sincerely,
Chris Graeter

Any ideas on who to talk to regarding a possible summer internship?

We will get working on this.

I have no problem with you sitting in on the PRC process.  We are scheduled 
to have this meeting on Nov. 29, however I think there is some chance this 
date might change due to bid week activities.

Frank W Vickers
11/12/2000 02:16 PM
Scott, great to see you last week even if it was only for a short period.  I 
hear that the Org announcement is scheduled for Tuesday November 14th at 
3:00.  Have you heard the same ?  I will be back in Houston early next week 
for the announcement.  I suggest that you and I plan to meet with the group 
either immediately after the announcement or perhaps after trading the 
following day.  I tend to think that the next day may be better.

In addition, as we discussed I would like to get one of the 
analysts/associates working on pulling the following information together.

List of our states.  maybe there is some overlap with the mid-west but as you 
know this new organization will have everyone focused and we do not want any 
confusion.
Master list of ALL gas users within those states.  If there are any LDC's 
etc. that cross state boundaries or cross regional boundaries we will need to 
know that and make sure Enron coverage is appropriately assigned.  Delainey 
continues to say that he wants to make sure that everyone is covered and 
nothing falls through the cracks.
From the master list we can determine our current level of business and 
relationship with that particular market, high, medium, low.
From Master list we can determine 2001 assignments.

This is fundamental but important in my opinion.

Another issue that I was thinking about is that it would be helpful for me to 
sit in on this years PRC for all members of our staff.  I will not add 
anything but it will give me a sense of how they are doing and what to expect 
as we move forward.  Do you approve of that ?  When is that scheduled ?

I did not get the metrics from Janet yet but am scheduled to do that when I 
am in next week.  I will get you a copy at that time.

Thanks

Frank

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible 
for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense 
contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of 
me.  Thanks.

The account is low so send contributions if you can.

Hola amigo !!!  I am already missing the Houston beers che.
Hey, we are going live on EOL here in south america.... incredible but real !
Rolo launched gas on monday and I will be coming on probably the following 
week.

In order to show potential customers how a liquid product works, could you 
tell me what product I can show them to actually reflect a moving bid/offer.

Thanks, Julian

I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students 
that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  
 I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her 
and I agree with your comments. 

Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought 
might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option 
Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading 
that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock 
Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have 
read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It 
is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A 
must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal

Hi Geynille and Scott,

I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyed
meeting you.  Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to make
our classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.  We
appreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuable
contribution.

One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later in
the day to tell me about her Enron interviews.  Milagros was very excited
about Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.  I want to
offer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.  Milagros is one of the
most impressive students I have ever taught.  While her GPA (3.9) is
sufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on her
intangible qualities.  Milagros is mentally tough, hard working,
determined, and ambitious.  Just as important, she is a genuinely nice
person.  She deals with people very well and possesses what I would
describe as quiet leadership characteristics.  In other words,  she leads
by example and by reason.  I also find her to be mature beyond her age and
willing to assume responsibility for her own choices.  In short, I think
Milagros would be an asset to any organization.

Again,  it was good meeting you.  Please fell free to contact me if I can
help you in any way.

fyi we have 2 weeks to check this out without cost.  maybe we can get 
additional ideas about how we incorporate capacity trading into EOL.
Sean Boyle@ENRON
10/23/2000 03:23 PM
Guys,
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on 
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on 
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, 
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the 
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months 
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I 
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here 
http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and

reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call

Hey guys, I spoke with Carol and told her we would have an overview for ENA 
by next Friday. Could each of you e-mail me a brief summary of your business 
in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your 
market, general themes we might want to get across, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, 
this may be a very good opportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for 
deregulation and power development, and what we would like to see the 
Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious 
connection with the Bush brothers), if it's appropriate to use Texas 
deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. 
If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. 
Thanks.

How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas 
Daily and which group will hold this risk?  
Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
system? 

   

Eric & John

Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

1 year term
or
2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000

firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
Department

gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
term

Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.

George x3-6992

Attached are initial comments of ENA which were filed Thursday in the Order 
637 Compliance Filings of the indicated pipelines.  For all other pipelines, 
we filed plain interventions.

Objected to "use it or lose it" provision on alternate primary points on 
segmented capacity.

Protested no tolerance on imbalance based on highest or lowest daily price in 
the month.

Protested additional charge to create a primary point on segmented capacity, 
forced daily balancing service, and change from unauthorized overrun penalty 
(which is credited) to a service which is not.  Requested technical 
conference.

Same as Tennessee

Attached below is the transport model I have been using for new deals.  It is 
set up right now for the Cranberry deal, but Kyle can show you how to modify 
it for any new deal.  Obviously, I have not been relying heavily on the

*********************************************************

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=
=20
$0.20
above residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=
 a=20
slightly
lower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=
ber
Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=
=20
expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=
=20
market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=
5=20
Bcf per day
of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =

the gas
market should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=

October, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20

lf=20
in short
supply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=
 of
demand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=

shutting
down production comes easily or cheaply.

Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=
s
justifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20
significant
settling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20
sustained in the
mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=
=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=

AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

The  CERA  executive roundtable meeting  summary  results are as  follows:
If you are interested  in  a complete  set  of  the graphs from the  
presentations  please  let me know.

ELECTRIC POWER  PART  ONE
PEAK  TRENDS
It is  noteworthy how  rapidly volatility can change geographically in the 
electric  markets.  Last  year  the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were  the 
peakiest,  but   it reversed  this year  with  the  West  being highest  at 
the peaks  and in New England --  but only   in early May 2000 were  hgih 
peaks  apparent  there.

Demand  can vary from half the peak max  to the max.  Peakers  can be on the 
margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.  We need to 
watch  gas prices  this  winter  as they can effect  winter peak power 
prices--not  just a  summer phenomenon.

Where  are  the most gas plants  now on the margin?  Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, 
NYPP, SERC, WSCC

A  DISCONNECT
There  is  a disconnect  in the on-peak forward market price for power in 
Texas now; with the  added  5 GW  Texas forward markets  do not seem to   
take this  into account yet.  (Note:  Vince Kaminski) The  Texas forward  
market  should be  very soft  next summer  unless  we return to  105 degree 
F  temperatures.    New England  is  just one year behind  Texas  in its 
overbuild.

One main  reason for the  spikes  in Calif  is   power plants  did not  get  
built in Calif   due  to  a lack of  a capacity  charge ..and  this is not a 
panacea...as Calif also  has  many  enviro/siting  hurdles  that challenge  
developers  who want to site as well.  

  .

TSUNAMI OF  MERCHANT  CAPACITY PLANNED?
CERA   sees  over  240,000  MW  of planned  capacity over  the  2000-2005 
period;  with   25,000 MW  being  completed  in  2000;  35 MW under 
construction  for   2001 and 15 000 MW under  construction for   2002--  but  
the market  only needing   13 000  to  15 000 MW  a year.   This   shall  
lead  to  many  and large deferrals and  delays, especially in  2001  and 
2002.  What  has  been the recent  history?   US  wide  over the
past  3 years  just  11 percent of the planned  capacity  was  actually 
finished  and   18 percent  of that planned  was  actually  under 
construction.  They  assume  a  24 month  construction completion  time.

FOR PROFIT  TRANSMISSION
Cera   sees  Allegheny Energy  in PJM West;  Entergy in SPP;  Southern  in 
SERC  and Alliant  in MAPP  as all for profit transcos.
TYPICAL   O&M COSTS  IN U.S.  TRANSCOS
 Why  do  O&M  costs   differ  widely  among  transcos?  Some  costs  are  3  
to 8 times higher  than the norm  at 
$5000 in O&M expense  per 5000  system  miles  in size.  Regulatory  
overhang  allows  this...this is  weather  adjusted  to remove  high  costs  
from  big  freezes  etc.

USING REAL OPTION MODEL  VS  POWER PLANT  NPV
You  want to  try to have  the base value of  an asset  going  forward  when 
you expect volatility  and include  historical  spreads  and  fuel/power  
price  swing  assumptions.

CALIFORNIA  MARKET IS BROKEN
This market  starts  to  work  only after it   gets into  a reliability 
crisis.  No incentives  to add power  plant  capacity  and
huge hurdles   against  siting   even when the market  signals the  need is  
there.  Will the  regulator's post 2000  fix  make it  worse?

PEAK POWER  DEMAND  FORECAST
As  percent  per year  change  vs   2000  Cera  sees   2001  as follows:
New Eng  / New York 6.3 /  6.2  percent
PJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percent
MAIN /  MAPP    3.0 /   -0.1
SERC /  FRCC   1.3 /  2.3  percent
SPP /  ERCOT    4.0  /  2.3
NWPP /  Rockies     -6.8  /  -0.6
AZNM /  Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0
USA  avg    up  2.6  percent   It  looks  like Calif. in in for a   touch 
summer  in 2001  as well.

NATURAL  GAS  PART   TWO
SUPPLY  SHORT
Year   2001  supply  rebound could  be  800mmcfd   to 1.0  bcfd;  Canada   in 
2001  up only  400  a  day; in the US  we  need   2  bcfd  more supply  for  
2001  demand.  alone  let alone  storage   refill.... yet  a
cold winter  now  could   add   3  to 4  bcfd  to demand  and slash  
storages.  The  fall in drilling  in 1999  and early  2000  took   3.5  bcfd 
productive  capacity out of the  supply pool.  It  will  take  till  2005  
for US production to  reach a 4.1 bcfd  gain versus  today's production.

ADDED  GAS  FOR POWER PLANTS
Right now  Cera  expects  an incremental  need for   1  bcfd  next year for 
these plants..this will  keep prices  high

MUCH MORE POWER SWING
1990 to 1992  we needed   5  bcfd  for power plant  swings;   now  we need   
10  bcfd;  offpeak use is  even up  5  bcfd vs  10 years  ago.

RESI  USE  IS UP
The  AGA  disco members   adds   750 000 new gas   homes  each year  and 
this  builds  demand  year   round.

INDUSTRIAL   NUG  DEMAND
Of  the   24  bcfd ( 8.77 Tcf) industrials  gas use  in the US;     8.6  
bcfd   (  3.1  Tcf) of this  is for  power plant  and non-mfg  use.

HOW  FAST  CAN CANADA  ADD?
Canada  can add   3.6  bcfd   by  2005   versus  now;   adding  each year 
from  2001 to 2005 as follows:  500/800/900/700/700  mcfd annually.

IS  ARCTIC  GAS  ON THE HORIZON?
Its  is  far away;   maybe   4  or  5  bcfd  by  2015..  This  means  up  to  
2.7  bcfd  to  flow  to Midwest  by 2015  and up  to  2.4  bcfd  to 
Calif./PNW   on expansions  by  2015.

Scott,

As you are already aware, we have to provide volume (settled sales only) 
explanations to Investor Relations each month.  Given that it's a quarter end 
month, it is even more important that we receive good explanations which 
sufficiently support your trading business.  The format includes a year to 
year comparison, quarter to quarter comparison as well as a month to month 
comparison for any increases/decreases greater than 10%.  Your stats are as 
follows:

EAST GAS TRADING (Bbtu/Day - Settled Sales Only)

Year to Year
September 2000 7,258
September 1999 3,179
Increase  128%

Quarter to Quarter
3Q 2000  7,282
3Q 1999  2,910
Increase  150%

If you could send me an explanation explaining what's driving your increase 
by tomorrow morning, that would be great.

Thanks, Paula

yes, I would love to see all the potential candidates within the entire 
organization.  Thanks for all your help.

   
	
	

Scott,
Is the purpose of this to find potential candidates and if so, wouldn't you 
want to see who is available within the entire organization?

Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  

Thanks,
Jennifer    

do you need any info from me?
How did our volumes look for Sept.?

It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for September is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, 
this is the shortcut on your desktop called "Statistical Database". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
analysis.  Please review the analysis for September 2000 and provide 
explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
personnel.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 3:00pm 
Tuesday, October 10th.  Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Misti

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

Dear Wildca t Players and  Parents:

In planning for this Tuesday's game, it could  be damp and cold.
Therefore, in order to maximize the comfort of our players, I would
suggest:

1)  have a tight fitting leather or imitation leather glove (Jacob will be
using
    his baseball gloves).  The key is " tight and thin".

2) Extra (Thin) layer of clothing under uniform (Thermals work well). The
    Key is "tight and  thin layer".

3) Large oversize (cheap)  pancho - cut open in the front. The key is
"oversized"
   and easy on/off.

See you at practice tonight!
Go Wildcats!

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=

future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

I am ok with intraday recall, however this should be agreed to by the parties 
to the capacity release deal.  In other words, the parties should have the 
flexibility to make deals to include intraday recall rights or not. 

   

Please see Gary's memo below.  Basically, Gary needs to know ASAP whether we 
have changed our stance on partial day capacity releases.  In the past, we 
have been against partial day recalls of capacity; however, with the growing 
need for on peak, off peak service, have we changed our stance?  There are 
obviously pros and cons to both approaches--we just need to agree on what we 
want our official stance to be.  Please advise ASAP.

Donna, As per your request, the attached is from the GISB comments filed by 
Keyspan, National Fuel and the AGA about Capacity release issues on Order 637 
and what GISB did or did not address in its evaluation of the FERC Order 637 
changes needed for the Current Capacity Release Standards. I have only 
researched the requests that have to do with Recall, Right to do Partial day 
Releases and Partial Day Recall. 
As you know, these have  been added to a Two day BPS meeting in Colorado 
Springs next week (OCT 10 & 11),  which I will be attending. At the last EC 
meeting the LDC's wanted this issue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an issue that 
needs further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC 
asked for guidance from the members and it was suggested by the EC members to 
send this issue back to the BPS committee for further discussion, with a 
commitment from the LDC's to have parties in attendance. Then BPS was to 
present a report, on progress, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeting. 
In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of 
any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.

Cindy, I think we may have a few things missing.     This is what Alagasco 
shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:

There are four  old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to 
ENA.  They are:

Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/00  (has 
associated demand fees)     Alagasco ref # --  ENA No. 2,  Sitara #-250042
Bring Reference number  #10055, volume of 10000 expires 11/30/00 (has 
associated demand fees)      Alagasco ref # -- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-250050

These are the only  two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance 
with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES 
contracts that have expiration dates in 2001 and 2002 that  they have no 
intention of  terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we 
would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them.   
They are:

Bring reference number #10219, volume of  5339, expires 10/31/01  (has 
associated demand fees)     Algasco ref # -- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196
        Please note that in the system we have the termination date is 
correct but the volume is incorrect.  It reflects 10,000 and you can see that 
the date ranges have been split  each monthby  Joe Casas, whom  changes the 
volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what 
Alagasco is actually taking.  This needs to be corrected.     .Again, 
Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.

Bring reference number #10326,  volume of 10,000 during the winter only, 
months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)  Algasco ref # -- ENA No.4
This deals expires October 31, 2002.  Sitara # --250186       This is the 
contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to 
exercise. 
AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing 
language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since 
they have yet to exercise  those swing rights and I did not want to bring it 
to there attention.    I do not know how much the demand fees are on this 
cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant.

Alagasco has sent  two termination letters to cancel the first two above 
contracts, only.  i.e.-- Bring ref #'s  10170 & 10055.    ENA does reflect 
these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate 
these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two 
termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal 
contracts that were done in Apirl & May 00  between Roger and myself, Sitara 
deals 242653 & 271301; Algasco  would like to tie these contracts  to the 
newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.

All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare 
# 250196, which I mentioned above.  I do not know the demand fees associated 
with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or 
if they are being billed accurately.

Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the 
confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.    Please get with 
me once you have a minute.    Thank you.

Just wanted to let everyone know I started a new job last Friday:
    Pipeline Power Partners
    10000 Memorial Drive, Suite 200
    Houston, Texas 77024
    713-290-8762
I'm back working on compressor stations and gas storage projects with some
of the guys I worked with on the Columbia Gas Compressor station in '93-'94.
Note new email address also.

Barry called me last week about the well pump. It was not working and he had
tried everything he knew to do. We decided to call Western Water Well
Service in Conroe to check it out. Bottom line-it was beyond repair and we
had to replace at a cost of $765.52. When our tenant at the time took it
upon himself to dig a new well ($1500) he had them put in a real cheap
pump-so that's why it went out in a relatively short period of time. We now
have only $90 in the account so everyone needs to think about making a
contribution sometime soon. If you have a question, please call.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the 
Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September 
of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly 
speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in 
December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  
February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high 
of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 
the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the 
Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and 
geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking 
openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its 
way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were 
wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

No interest at this time.

Thank you.

fyi  -  interesting storage information.

FYI.  We should get a copy of the filing next week and will forward.  Based 
on this, I will probably file a protest as well.

On September 22, 2000, Dominion Transmission, Inc. ("DTI") and its customers 
(and interested state commissions) continued to meet to discuss DTI's 
upcoming TCRA filing to be submitted to FERC on September 29, 2000.  The 
customers had numerous questions for DTI about why its upcoming TCRA filing 
will result in such a large rate increase, and advised DTI that it needed to 
provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful 
response to DTI's settlement proposal made on September 15, 2000.

DTI opened the meeting by defending its upcoming TCRA filing as prudent, in 
accordance with FERC's prior orders on its TCRA mechanism, and legally 
defensible.  DTI then asked for responses to its settlement proposal made 
last week.  The basic feedback was that the customers "were not there yet."  
The customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement (in an 
effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming TCRA filing), but they wanted 
more of an explanation from DTI of its proposed substantial rate increase.

Much of the customer's questioning focused on DTI's "non-purchased" fuel 
supply (i.e., fuel gas DTI has borrowed from storage) and the continued 
growth in this element of its fuel supply mix over the past few years.  As of 
June 30, 2000, DTI has borrowed approximately 23 Bcf from storage for fuel 
use.

DTI also revealed that it had "liberated" approximately 13 Bcf of base 
storage gas over the last several years (i.e., reclassified base storage gas 
into working gas), and that this gas was "still on the system."  DTI said it 
had a $0.31 per MMBtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for 
a future storage project.   The liberated gas had not yet been reflected by 
DTI in its FERC reports or accounts.  Arguably, this gas has been parked in 
space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying DTI a 
return on this gas.

During the bulk of the meeting the customers asked questions and DTI answered 
them.  DTI volunteered little; most information had to be extracted from its 
representatives.  The feeling of many of the customers was that DTI was not 
being forthright.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the customers said they wanted to ask more 
questions and would present DTI with their questions in the near future.  
Only after they have a better sense of the facts would the customers 
seriously entertain settlement offers.  Some customers expressed a desire for 
DTI to terminate its TCRA mechanism.  The customers also said the TCRA 
problems need to be addressed permanently so that there is not a "TCRA 
crisis" every year.

Accordingly, DTI will make its TCRA filing on September 29, 2000 seeking a 
cost increase of approximately $65 million.  It appears that the customers 
will protest the filing and await FERC action on the filing and protests.  In 
the meantime, another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively 
set for October 18, 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in Washington.  The meeting may be 
cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve 
the issues at that time.

Please contact us if you have any questions about this matter.

The quantity adjustment should be 398,487 per the attached spreadsheet.  
Please confirm.

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.

Call me if there are any questions.

Please add Dan Junek to your list of 'Bad Traders" he entered into two 
transactions with National Energy and Trade, LLC, without notifying Credit of 
the transactions.  Both transactions were October one month Physical Sales of 
Natural Gas for a total of 232,500 mmbtu's at index plus .0050.   Total 
Delivery exposure is roughly $1.2MM.  A Letter of Credit has been required 
for this trade.

Veronica Espinoza had a conversation with Dan within the past month, 
explicitly stating our credit concern for this counterparty and told Dan not 
to trade with the counterparty unless it was approved by Credit.  The 
counterparty was added to the Credit Watch List after this conversation last

The results of the February 26th PVT test conducted on Nville have been 
discussed with each of you over the last three months.  As we have 
discussed....effective Sep 13th,  Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's 
inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.

I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are 
correct.  Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.

The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.  The results of 
the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.  In addition, 
there is a reduction of 22,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA 
values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet 
and the "official" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.

To summarize:
 Enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,223,000MMBTU.
 Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588MMBTU.

Call me if there are any questions.

Argentine Power Market update:
A series of sabotage acts occurred last Tuesday, putting the whole Argentine 
Electric System in danger of collapsing. The problems started at 8:30 PM when 
one of the 500 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 
other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 
incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high 
tension towers were sawed.
In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:00 PM, one of the 
Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.
This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an 
overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as 
well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked 
out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.

As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 11:00 
PM.
Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.

For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the 
sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).

Thanks for your help!

Dayton Power answer to your high demand question in the morning meeting today.

Steve,

Would you believe it's cold-weather driven????  They're forecasting average
temps up here of 58 on Thr, 54 on Fri, and 55 on Sat.  Jeanette and I both
believe that the demand forecasts are way too high.  Hopefully our gas
control will knock these forecasts down a little.

This is ok with me.  Thank you for resolving.

Scott,

Yesterday, I received a phone call from Scott Goodell regarding his vacation 
balance.  He and his assistant thought the was a mistake in his vacation 
accrual.  I have researched the issue with the payroll department and the SAP 
team and they see an inconsistency in his account.  

However, Scott says that he was given 3 weeks vacation (120 hours) as part of 
the CES acquisition.  His offer letter does not state the 120 hours up front, 
but we can add this to his balance and correct the problem, if you approve.  
I know he has contacted several people to resolve this, so I'd like to get 
back to him as soon as possible.

Let me know if this is OK,

Thanks,
Jennifer

Folks,

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

set up right now for the Cranberry deal, but Kyle can show you how to modify 
it for any new deal.  Obviously, I have not been relying heavily on the 
extrinsic values this model produces.

Scott:  I left you a voice mail last night.  We have some tickets for the 
Gypsy Kings concert in the Woodlands Saturday night and Mary and I wanted to 
see if you and Carol wanted to join us.  I've been working till 2:00 in the 
morning the last few nights so have waited way too late to invite you.  Sorry 
for that.  But try to let me know ASAP if you can go.

US Govt. data - 

 Business inventories rose 0.9% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations
of a 0.6% rise and matching the revised May figure. Retailers saw the
biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in June. Total business sales
were also up 0.9% in June, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1%
rise posted in May. The inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it
would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots
at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low.
In a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in July,
double the pace in June. Industrial production, which measures output at
U.S. factories, utilities, and mines, is now 5.8% stronger than it was this
time last year, due mainly to continued growth in high-tech manufacturing.

Sean,

I talked to Bruce a couple of days ago but got a little different spin.  The 
short list is 6 companies, not 5.  Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we 
were second the last.  NIMO was disappointed that more companies did not bid 
on their RFP.  I asked if an extra $2MM would have pushed us into the short 
list.  NIMO said yes but it would still not be the highest bid.  Our bid was 
$4.9 MM.  I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage 
optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnect).

I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breese last week and he is 
working on it.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Sean Boyle
08/17/2000 11:21 AM
I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP.  Bruce indicated NiMo 
short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA.  However, he also 
mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He 
gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.  He also said that the 
other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative 
structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure.   
NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I 
believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP.  
Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP.
Thanks,
Sean

Here you go.  If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

Please plan to attend an Origination Strategy meeting on Thursday 8/17 at  
2:30pm.  We will be meeting with Gil Muhl, Janet Dietrich
and others to discuss customer coverage, deal flow, strategic deals/customers 
etc.  I think the meeting is going to held offsite  at either 
the Doubletree or Hyatt.  

Details to follow.  Let me know if you have any questions.

A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.

1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to 
replace Access and to handle basis trading.
   The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis 
products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), 
Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.

2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players 
with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the 
current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board 
in the    next few weeks.    

3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the 
weekly storage data.     

4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount 
through the Hub for volume commitment. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

fyi.

Please follow up to make sure these $ are going to the correct p&l.

The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came 
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total 
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered 
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like 
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for 
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice 
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.  
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other 
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the 
payment should be here shortly.
   If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.

I recently joined the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team as 
Director of Career Development.   Celeste Roberts, who handled many facets of 
the Associate and Analyst Program will now focus primarily on Recruiting.  I 
am responsible for staffing, rotation management, and performance management 
reporting directly to Charlene Jackson.   Going forward, I will partner with 
the PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and 
year-end performance management process.   

There are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year 
effort to a close.  As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates 
and Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to 
communicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August 
11, 2000.    As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been 
given until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.    If you need our 
assistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me 
know and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.

Additionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review 
efforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this 
effort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.    
Please look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that 
requests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we 
might improve.  We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.   

Once again, the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team would like to 
thank you for your involvement in the performance review process.  I can be 
reached at 713-853-7351.  My assistant is Constance Charles and she can be 
reached at 713-853-5614.  I look forward to working with each of you.

thanks for the update.

Pablo Acevedo @ ENRON   08/01/2000 12:39 PM

This is how far we got with these guys.

We did our best, believe me.

Pablo-
Dick, 
As we discussed today, Enron's analysis of Bunge's energy information 
indicates
inadequate regulatory and pricing opportunity for Enron to create additional 
value for Bunge.

Electricity:
The predominance of electricity usage occurs in states that are either 
several years
away from enacting deregulation or where the rules are insufficiently 
determined at this
time to even estimate an opening date.  When opening dates are more clearly 
defined
and we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could 
revisit this
area of your energy profile. 

Natural Gas:
Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and 
transporation 
agreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.  For those 
reasons, the 
opportunities are very limited for Enron to apply a consolidation approach 
and provide
compelling additional value for Bunge.

As we agreed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for 
mutual value
and then decide what, if any next steps were appropriate.  I regret we will 
not be able to
help Bunge at this time, but know that Enron will remain interested in 
assisting your
company in the future if and when market conditions afford us that 
opportunity.  

Please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer 
further questions
for you or others who have been involved in this process.  Dick, thank you 
again for 
providing your time and attention to this inquiry process.  

Sincerely,

Gary Mirich

Everything is good here. Gary has been with Enron for quite a while.  Most 
recently, he managed interest rate and foreign exchange/currency risk.  You 
should give him a call or email.  

Besitos a las chicas de Filo.

Suerte,

Scott

Pablo Acevedo @ ENRON   08/01/2000 12:37 PM

Hey Scott,
How is the East Desk doing?I can imagine that things are rolling over there. 
Do you know this new guy assigned to trading Ag. commodities Gary Hickerson? 
I would really like to get in touch with him. What do you think.

Trying to make things roll down here.

PS: Hey the chicks from Filo are still asking about you. 

James is a neighbor and  good friend of mine.  He and his wife went to school 
with my wife.  Although I have never worked with James, my view is he is a 
marketer/originator/business developer.

Scott:

Thanks fo the lead.  Just a couple of quick questions: (1) How well do you 
know James?  (2)  Depending upon your answer to #1, what type of role would 
you see him playing in an ENA group?

Hope all is well.

I agree.

Scott: Barry called me this morning and asked if we would want to get the
stumps ground of the trees removed in the yard. He said the tree man had a
relative that would do it for a $70 set up fee plus $5 per stump (approx 14
stumps). The tree man will deduct this off of what he owes us for the trees.
I told Barry to go ahead as it needs to be done and the price is right.

Network Appliance Selects TIBCO Software to Support Enterprise
System Initiatives

TIBCO Technology Enables Network Appliance to Integrate Its Internal 
Enterprise Systems Without Disrupting Its
Business

PALO ALTO, Calif., July 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Advancing its leadership in the 
application integration space, TIBCO Software Inc. (Nasdaq: TIBX -
news), a leading provider of real-time infrastructure software for 
e-business, announced today Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTAP - news), the
leading provider of network-attached data access and content management 
solutions, has selected the TIBCO ActiveEnterprisec e-business product
suite to integrate its internal enterprise systems and applications. As a 
fast growing company, Network Appliance has been continually implementing
best-in-class enterprise systems such as enterprise resource planning, 
customer resource management, human resources and manufacturing applications.
To integrate these disparate systems and ensure that the right people within 
Network Appliance have access to the information they need, Network
Appliance turned to TIBCO.

``We need an integration tool that will not only enable us to share 
information internally, but will also enable us to extend access to this 
information beyond
our corporate firewalls, as we expand our e-commerce capabilities,'' said Ric 
McCormick, director of business applications for Network Appliance.
``TIBCO's proven e-business solutions provide us with the scalability, 
security and reliability we need to ensure that our technology infrastructure 
can
keep up with our business growth, and just as important, that our vital 
business processes not be disrupted as we continue to implement new 
solutions.''

``To be successful e-businesses, companies need a highly efficient 
information infrastructure that connects every system and process in the 
enterprise,''
said Fred Meyer, vice president of product management for TIBCO Software. 
``TIBCO ActiveEnterprise is helping leading companies like Network
Appliance further leverage their front-end and back-end IT systems and bring 
those systems closer to customers and partners over the Web.''

About TIBCO ActiveEnterprise

The core of TIBCO's real-time software infrastructure offering is the TIBCO 
ActiveEnterprise suite, designed for building a complete, end-to-end
Internet and enterprise infrastructure that successfully scales to the most 
demanding business information networks. It provides a real-time e-business
integration platform that encompasses data integration and transformation, 
business process coordination, messaging, enterprise portals and alerting,
adapters for legacy, packaged and third-party applications, plus enterprise 
monitoring and management.

About Network Appliance

Network Appliance, Inc., a veteran in network file serving and caching, has 
been providing data access solutions since 1992, and is a member of both the
S+P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index. Major corporations and ISPs, including Lycos,

solutions (NetCache(TM) appliances) and file servers (filers) deliver fast,
simple, reliable, and cost-effective access to network-stored data and enable

The company pioneered the concept of the ``network appliance,'' an extension 
of the industry trend toward dedicated, specialized products that perform
a single function. Network Appliance filers and NetCache appliances are based 
on the company's innovative data access software known as the Data
ONTAP(TM) operating system and standards-compliant hardware.

I thought I might pass this along your way to see if you had any ideas or 
know of any needs. Win Graham used to work at C&L and looking for trading 
opportunities at Enron. He's not interested the associate program at this 
time.

His employer doesn't know he's looking, but feel free to pass this along to 
anyone who might have or know of a need.

From my exposure to him, he seemed like a great guy that would probably fit 
in well at Enron. Very personable!

Hope things are going well for both of you!

Hey Phil, let's set up a meeting for later this week to walk thru this deal 
structure in detail with Scott Neal. If we think there is real value here to 
ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we 
can/want to make these commitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The 
critical path item as I see it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as 
offtake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the 
current gas index price embedded in the Elba tolling agreement. 

Jeff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and attend.  Thanks.

thanks for the info.

This one is an exception. I sent out a mail about this site before, about a 
month ago, 
let me explain the situation again.
It is weird that this web site uses such a long line as the URL link for 
their critical notices, 
but Lotus notes can only take the first line starting with http:// as the hot 
link, this is why you see
only the first line was underlined as the link. When you click the partial 
URL link, of course you'll
get an error. To work around this you need to copy the whole five lines, open 
your IE and paste
it to the address box and press "Enter". Let me know if there is still a 
question. Thanks.

release at 10:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.  The purpose of the separate 
releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to 
communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  
One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and 
sellers the opportunity to see our prices.

Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.

perfect.   thank you.

   

I spoke with Dorie Hitchcock and she said that since the estimated cost is 
less than $5000, we do not need the form.  She said I can simply forward her 
a copy of the expense report after the dinner.

we need to make sure we go through this approval for Tammy's upcoming 
meeting. 

Sent by: Enron NA Office of the Chairman@ENRON
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

please forward to everyone in our group.

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction
Process With FERC

FAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its quest to promote creative 
regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmission, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacity
auction process that enhances Columbia's current open auction process.

In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for 
selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems. 
The filing
was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is 
consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, which
encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' 
to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,
Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance 
filing made June 15.

``Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party 
that places the highest value on it,'' said Carl Levander, vice-president of
Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ``Even though we 
conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often
wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current 
process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the 
auction is
closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.''

According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving 
to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes into
consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in 
capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term
contracts.

Under Columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, Columbia would ``offer'' (via 
its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm 
capacity.
Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the 
quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discounted
capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if 
Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with 
a
different term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a 
present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time 
before a
binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.

Columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles 
outlined in FERC's Order 637. 

    *     Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will
          begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be
          posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (EST).
    *     The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-
          discriminatory basis.
    *     The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing
          EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be
          made available on the Internet.
    *     The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since
          bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to
          each capacity package made available.
    *     As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's
          identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection
          criteria were applied.
    *     The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all
          bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to
          all bidders through an Internet-based system.

``We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity 
auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all 
parties
as well as innovative in design,'' Levander said.

Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is 
based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for
transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to 
withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.

Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, 
Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to
markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 
Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates one
of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading 
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its
operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, 
including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,

electric power generation. Information about Columbia Energy Group

I will be there.  I think I will start earlier in the morning because I have 
tickets to the Astro's game.  

I'm planning to clean out the garage this Saturday morning starting about 9
a.m. It would be great if you two could help me sort through the things and
help decide what is give away, throw away, or take to the Farm. It shouldn't
take too long. Bill is coming in about noon at Hobby and I will pick him up.
We plan to try and finish the inside of the house that afternoon. Let me
know if you can help. Thanks.

FRANCE:
PDVSA sees Enron LNG deal soon, seeks gas funds.

06/07/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NICE, France, June 7 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) said on Wednesday it expected to sign a contract with U.S.
energy company Enron by June 30 to construct an LNG plant in Jose with an
annual capacity of two million tonnes.

It has signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell , ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi
to begin construction of a four-million-tonne LNG plant in Paria by end of the
year.
"We could sign the contract to start the project (with Enron) by June 30...The
plant should be operational by 2004," Domingo Marsicobetre, chairman of
PDVSA's gas division, told reporters at the world gas congress in Nice.

"The project development agreement was signed with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi
last month. In September we will declare the viability of the project and then
create a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone is
December," Marsicobetre said.

The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 2005, he said, adding that
the consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco delta
platform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. "In
August a decision will be taken by the shareholders," he said.

PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also be
a shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and the
United States, he said.

The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,
Spain and Portugal.

Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion in
private investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNG
projects and the Venezuelan gas grid.

Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent of
that total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. The
cost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was not
included in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.

"If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment," Mava said.

He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with proven
reserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development of
non-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.

Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 2009, rising to
4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meant
the percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 55 percent from 42, Mava
said.

Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated.
But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshore
and 40-60 offshore, he said.

Cove Point LNG Completes Open Season With 3 Pacts

06/09/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of
Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid
natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near
Lusby, Md., the company said.

  Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso
Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA).
  The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory
approvals.

  The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new
service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million
cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG
imports by the three companies.

  The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent)
storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location.

  Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to
recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage
facilities including the new LNG storage.

  Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG
Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The
transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday.

ENA Competitive Analysis & Business Controls

Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of 
operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and 
is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth 
of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very 
high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial 
area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve 
our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..

Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of 
operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to 
operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to 
make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows 
interest in learning.

thanks for the info.

yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas 
prices.    Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the 
month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term 
commitments.   There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix 
up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small 
gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.    PCS initially reduced their 
voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s 
and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are 
at max volumes.

Thanks.

Live video from our morning call: [IMAGE]

After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling 
ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who 
believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little 
history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.

For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  
pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has 
had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's 
fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent 
commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.

Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has 
been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 
1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.

There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. 
There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single 
six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an 
astonishing 52.92%.

Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 
1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very 
worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the 
wake of the stock market crash of 1929.  

The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the 
one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 
1970s. 

The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the 
one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 
1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month 
period. 

This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  
means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time 
it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 
has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 
years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. 

It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went 
down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an 
additional 18.24%. 

Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 
chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course 
the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things 
getting  better. 

But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six 
months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the 
coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the 
last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  
If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  
left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. 

History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  
day).

Unnatural  History

After the last two horrible quarters, many of  us are probably telling 
ourselves that it can't get much worse than it's been.  For those of us who 
believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me  give you a little 
history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse  than this.

For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&P 500, because that  
pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has 
had  it a lot worse -- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's 
fairly  concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent 
commentaries  the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.

Over the last two quarters  the S&P 500 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has 
been, that actually only  ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 
1800. Believe it or not,  there have been 77 that were worse.

There were eight six-month  periods in which the S&P 500 lost more than 40%. 
There were 18 in which it  lost more than 30%. The very worst single 
six-month period was the one ending  May, 1932, in which the S&P 500 lost an 
astonishing 52.92%.

Of the 77 six-month periods  worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 
1900, and none of them were  during the Civil War. 33 (including the very 
worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the  Great Depression that followed in the 
wake of the stock market crash of 1929.  

The worst six-month period  in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the 
one ended September, 1974, with  the S&P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 
1970s. 

The most recent period worse  than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the 
one ended March, 1988, with the  S&P down 19.56%. That means that in the 
1990s there were no six-month  periods worse than the most recent six-month 
period. 

This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no  
means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time 
it  shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&P 500 
has  done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 200 
years. But  don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. 

It can. Of the 77 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&P  went 
down further during the next six months 24 times -- losing an  average of an 
additional 18.24%. 

Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 
chance  of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course 
the good  news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things 
getting  better. 

But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&P rose over the  next six 
months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now  over the 
coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of  the 
last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.  
If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents  
left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. 

History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every  
day).

sorry for the delay, I just checked my email

1.  yes
2. Lorraine Ryall met came to Houston during March 2000 for Gas Fair and she 
stopped by our office for a brief visit.
3.  I am not aware of any.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

 
 Scott and Tori: 

 I hope you are both doing well.  I have some questions for you about this 
matter that will help me on a jurisdictional legal issue:  

 1.  Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad, 
Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you 
would have taken the call in Houston?  I am assuming that this is probably 
the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you. 

 2.  Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to 
meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)?

 3.  Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you 
are aware of?

 Many thanks for your usual quick response.

 Britt

 P.S. to Becky--I think you had some questions for Credit about how much is 
owed.  Can you please flange that down today or tomorrow?  I want to get the 
petition filed this week. 

Thank you very much for your help.

Scott,
Please see the attached presentation.  It incorporates a comprehensive view 
of Enron.  Please let me know if you require additional information.

Scott, Thanks again for the trading overview you gave our desk today.  It was 
a great lead-in to future sessions.  Like we agreed, I would like to have

Mr. Neal,

 I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you
about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy
risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I
would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of questions,
I would be happy to provide them.
 This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't
want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy
risk applications are being used "on the ground".  I would like to be able
to write about Enron, but it is not required.
 I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

I think maybe clarifying "then go to the transaction search" with something

Scott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.  
There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about 
financial transactions.  I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a 
forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against 
them too much.

Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to 
maintain system integrity.  And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first 
come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas 
trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.  They no longer have a 
fuel tracker.  Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their 
transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.  

The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so 
Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report 
its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.  They do, however, 
have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases 
they make for balancing.  If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate 
for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue 
could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.  Purchases made for 
system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed 
in the next rate case.

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to 
have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your 
reference.

thanks,

Scott

 - new leo's resume.doc

 - resume1.doc

Also, send me a copy of your resume.  thanks.

Scott:

Greetings from LSU.  I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps you
didn't receive it.  No big deal.

I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.  My last
semester is shaping up to be pretty tough.  The MBA class in Real Options
is, to say the least, tough!  I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, and
so far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,
risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,
and pricing American, European, and exotic options.  What's also great
about the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an example
of how this stuff works in the real world.  It's a great class!

One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well,
because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.
Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I need
to be doing.

I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlighting
lines on every page!  I figured I'd start with the less technical books
first, considering my workload.

I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/11
with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.  Let me know
how your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together.

Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new trading
rotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.  As I'm learning
more about options and futures in class, you're definitely right--I think
trading is where I want to be!

Thanks again and I hope to hear from you soon.  I hope all is well in
Houston.

Kevin

All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking 
the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is 
the person I 
contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be 
in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her 
phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the 
email, I look forward to seeing you this summer.

Rockhounds & Parents,
?
Looks like we'll be rained out this afternoon for batting cage  practice.? 
For tomorrow's practice we'll probably be unable to play on the  field due to 
standing water, or possibly continued rain, but, we will go ahead  and have a 
"skull" session at my house at 9:00am.? My address is 13611  Pinerock, just 
off of Yorkchester (between Wilchester and Kirkwood), 4 blocks  north of 
Memorial.
?
The practice tomorrow will be 1 hour, from 9 till 10:00.?  See everyone then.

Before you begin trading your EnronOnline products on March 1st ...

  Review the dates on your products.

We are in the process of converting "regular" products to "Tokenized 
Reference Period" Products.

A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as "Day 
Ahead", "Month Ahead", "Month Ahead +1", etc - but this is not what you or 
your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current 
date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For 
example, if Product #20451 is "Month+1", then on Feb. 28, the Short 
Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show "April1-30".    
However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product 
#20451 to show "May1-31".  Note that the Product number stays the same, but 
the date has automatically updated.

When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - 
your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product 
Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it 
might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the 
same Product all the time - only the date changed).

Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your 
life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new 
Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should 
continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.

The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have 
Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change 
automatically on the 1st day of each new month.  
 
For example:

On Feb. 28, the "Prompt Month" product will be March; but on March 1, it will 
become April, etc.  
On Feb. 28, the "Prompt +1 Month" product will be April; but on March 1, it 
will become May. etc.

To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a 
specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st 
tab marked "Product Details."   Your product will be "Tokenized" if it has 
the following applications:

There will be a check mark  in the box after "Lifespan Tokenized?"
The term "Prompt Month" or "Prompt Month +1" will be displayed in the next 
scroll-down box.

If you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact 
the following members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group:
Rob Cass x 35491
Kevin Meredith   x 39555
Melba Lozano x 58986
Chris Walker x 37533

Origination was granted to Robin last night for $468.  However, I wanted to 
bring it to your attention that sitara  #618541 and 618626 are two day deals 
and my calculations show that $708 may instead be the correct amount of 
origination.  Please correct me if I'm wrong or let me know if I should grant 
to Robin an extra $240 tonight.    

Thanks,

Scott,
I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01 
through  June-01 of up to 4 Bcf.  
I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about 
achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.  I am not 
supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed 
the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take 
this to her boss.
Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better.

Tammi,
As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee 
you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle.

Example:  Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers.  
DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload 
purchase.

ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an 
option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d.
Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of 
the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take 
the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas.

Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for  April and May 
@ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index  -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 
cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,400.
However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the 
FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,500. ENA 
would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the 
sale.  Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the 
flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity.  
Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will 
receive only the baseload quantity.  If ENA exercises the option everyday 
then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of 
Index -2 cents.

This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed 
the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth 
month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month 
period.  Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option 
will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.  If you would like me to do a 
conference call with Michelle just let me know.

Thanks,
Sean

I have 3 addtional candidates for consideration:

Seung-taek Oh (Associate - Credit Derivatives)
Scott Loving   (East Logistics)
Eric Boyt   ( Gas Structuring)

Thanks, I have sent him a note notifying him and requsting his resume.

Thx. kb.

I would like Joe Casas (currently East logistics) to participate in the 
interview process.
We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  
If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and 
associates arrive and do a session then.

Rockhounds & parents,
?
Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached 
the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so 
hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format 
problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know.
?
Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm 
gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime 
at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the 
practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our  
game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on 
the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are 
rained out they will not be made up.
?
By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure 
some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please 
let me know how many will be able to attend.
?
I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the 
league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the 
fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and 
they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot.
?
See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30.
?
thanks,
Jeff

I keep getting "insufficient memory" messages on my computer.  And that's 
without running Dynegy Direct.

The IT guy said I need one of the following
1.  New super duper computer
2.  More memory, my computer has 128meg of ram
3.  Run my applications on 2 cmputers like mine instead of one.

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I appreciate it.

frank, jared, craig - fyi

open discussion meeting with everybody including logistics to talk about the business.

Tuesday,  10:30-11:30am 
Room ??? (I'll let you know)

Scott

Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 

List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 

In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 

Tks - Bob

I think it would be a good idea for us to have one shower for everybody.  So I will be taking donations, so I can buy the gifts this weekend.  The gifts will be for Craig, Vicki and Pete.  The shower will be Tuesday @ 4:00, Eb 32c2.

Thanks

I will be passing an envelop to collect a small monetary token of appreciation for Kimberly and Alex for Administrative Assistants' week.  Please give if you are able and in an amount that you 
feel is appropriate.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Carrie,

I am unable to do participate at that time on June 24 due to bid week.  However, after 3:30pm would work.  Let me know if this works for you.

Hi Scott - 

Per my voice mail, we have another Enron South America visitor arriving at Enron on 5/24, PDVSA or Petroleum Venezuela.  Please let me know if you are available to deliver the same presentation you gave to Petrobras to PDVSA.  The time is 2:00 - 2:45 in 50MO3.

Objectives:	
Favorably respond to a request from PDVSA to educate them about the natural gas industry 
Impress PDVSA with Enron's professional staff and operations, i.e. Build familiarity and favorability of Enron

Background:
PDVSA is Enron's key strategic partner in Venezuela.  For PDVSA, this visit represents a major opportunity for them to learn about the business of an industry that they are only now beginning to develop.  Until recently, PDVSA was limited to the petroleum until the new formation of their gas unit.
PDVSA (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the largest and most important company in Venezuela.  
It is one of the most important energy corporations in the world.
It is a national corporation that establishes tight direct links with foreign energy companies as well as with the Minister of Energy and the government of Venezuela.  
They are an enterprise that is multidisciplinary within the energy market.  It comprises in area of trade, refining, exploration and production.  (In particular: gas, emissions, petroleum, carbon, petrochemicals, lubricants, fertilizers, and combustion.)
PDVSA is owner of many important companies like Citgo, Veba Oil, Refinery Isla, Borco, Bopec, and many others.
Due to the importance of globalization within the energy market, there are many agreements with PDVSA and foreign companies.

PDVSA Relationship with Enron Venezuela

Enron Venezuela has two strategic partnerships with PDVSA.  PDVSA will supply natural gas to ACCROVEN, a $415 million natural gas extraction, fractionation, storage and refrigeration project with facilities in San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, and Jose that Enron recently constructed and will own and operate.  Enron is also developing a $700 million LNG project, which will include PDVSA as an equity partner and as the supplier of natural gas.  The final hurdle is authorization from the Venezuelan government that there are sufficient natural gas for the project.  

Attendees:
ANA KARINA SOLER - PDVSA GAS  
Director, Commercial Development   

OSCAR MONTENEGRO - PDVSA GAS 
Superintendant, Contracts & Negotiations 

CARLOS PEREZ - PDVSA GAS 
Manager, Commercial Business 
  
GONZALO ALVAREZ - INTESA
Account Manager for PDVSA GAS.

Thank you

Karen,

I had not thought about the title issue but my view is that if the person is a viable candidate and wants to pursue this track then title should be a non issue.  I don't see any problem with having a current manager in the program.  Having said all that, I don't know John Lavoratto's view.

Hi Scott,

Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading Track,   as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a step down.   From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the trading track as a manager?   I am meeting with him today to discuss the TT in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you have time.

Thanks, Karen.

I have 3 addtional candidates for consideration:

Seung-taek Oh (Associate - Credit Derivatives)
Scott Loving   (East Logistics)
Eric Boyt   ( Gas Structuring)

Thanks, I have sent him a note notifying him and requsting his resume.

Thx. kb.

I would like Joe Casas (currently East logistics) to participate in the interview process.
We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

John Thompson and Scott Josey are the guys doing the producer finance business.

Thank you so much for taking time to call the individuals assigned to you.  

Please try to contact anyone tonight that you were unable to reach yesterday.

After you have reached all your candidates,  please drop me a quick e-mail including whether or not they should continue in the interview process and a concrete reason why. 

Call me with any questions.  I will follow up tomorrow afternoon.  It is urgent that we make our decisions soon as the next step in the interview process is a week away.

John Hodge requested some information from Scott Neal.

He would like to see the # of counterparties we did physical trades with in the year 2000 and the volumes by month (sales) in New Jersey.

There are two Notional curves (locations) that are in New Jersey.  IF-TETCO/M3 and TRANSCO/Z6NONNY.

I cannot find any old files from Nagesh but I just need to see the volumes for the year and the number of counterparties.  I don't need to see the counterparty names just the number of counterparties for the year.

I think we should interview Gary Linhart for the trading track.

Good morning Scott -

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

On Behalf of Jared kaiser

I think that sounds  good.   I think Daniel has done a nice job for us.

Scott

Scott, As you know, Alex and Irena will be supporting Central in the new building .  That breaks up the support/sharing that occurs now when Kim is away from her desk.  I believe that the East needs Kim and 1 other full time to support our Admin needs.  That is in line with our budget.  I think that Ina was suggesting that we share with another group, which may undermine the service that we need.  Kim has suggested Daniel as a possible 2nd to her.  I believe that we should plan to bring Daniel on as a Temp when we get into the new building and then decide after a month or 2 as to what we want to do full time moving forward.  Any thoughts ?  yes ? no?

You are welcome to come down any day. 

 I think that changing the time on the 29th would be good since we are still in "bid week" that day.

Thanks,

Scott - 

I think we are going to move the afternoon start time to 4pm rather than 3pm.

I would love to still come down and sit with you one morning...is there any day this week that works for you?

Thanks so much!

Mastio and Company is a firm that specializes in Quality Surveys and Customer Satisfaction Surveys.  They have been compared to the JD Powers of the energy industry.  The surveys are very focused on those things that you would want to know about your customer's buying/selling practices including Electronic Trading Systems and how industry providers rank out.  I am not sure if this is a tool that we want to purchase but it is something that we should review.  To that end, a representative form Mastio will be in to provide a demonstration of the system at 10:30 Tuesday October 16.  Please notify Kim Bates if you are interested in attending.

Frank

Kim, please monitor this.  I need to let Mastio know if we want to do this by tomorrow (please remind me).  Would like to get 32c2 if possible.

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

Scott, I will forward to Nelson, Jill and Ruth and let them follow up on this meeting.  I think that we should contact Transco to determine exactly what is being addressed and that someone should go. We will loop in Fred and his group as well. Unless you or Hunter have another suggestion that is what I will do.  I will make sure that info learned will be passed along.

Frank

Nelson, Ruth, Jill please look into this and report you findings.

FYI>>>>>
Great!! Now they come out with this benefit, after I already bought my car.

I want to pass on some work information for you to share with the members of your team please.
     
Enron has partnered with Ford to provide special discounts to Enron employees on top of the rebates and discounts that normally apply.    The plan is called the Ford X Plan.   

Here's how it works:

Name
Address
Company
SSN
Etc. 

Upon providing this information you will be given or sent a PIN number.  Then you can go to any Ford dealership, tell them your an XPlan member, give them the PIN and tell them what car you want - no negotiating no haggling.  Any rebates and discounted interest rates still apply to this price. 

Regards
Frank

I hope all is well with you.  Hopefully, we will be starting up in the next weeks as UBS.

I don't know if you are still in the market for people.  I have attached the resume of Vickie Versen
for your review.  She was most recently responsible for trading physical gas in the Gulf.  She came out of 
our scheduling/logistics group and has extensive experience working on several East pipes.  I think she would 
consider a trading or scheduling position.

Sincerely,

I did not agree to this $50,000 pmt for Enron to keep these contracts. 
 I did not cut that deal nor did I agree to pay this fee.

Karen,

I spoke with Brian this morning and he has agreed with me that this financial obligation resides at the East desk, under Scott Neal.  It is also my understanding that when the joint venture was established that one of the deal components was that the East desk would absorb these contract positions.

As such,  I agree that the obligation should be processed and paid by Bryce's group.  If Scott or Bryce have any questions, they should meet with Brian Redmond.

Regards, Jean

Jean,
Bryce sent this message to Brian this morning.  If September and October are included, the amount is $700k.  My personal feeling is that the fact that no one wants to take the hit for this is irrelevant.  Contractually, Bridgeline is owed this money and the payments should have been processed by Bryce's group.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have suggestions on how to proceed.
Thanks,
Karen

Brian - Bridgeline is billing us $50,000/month for two contracts where ENA has not received consent to assignment from CES by the counterparty.  Apparently the contract with Bridgeline stipulated that until such time as the consent was received on these contracts, ENA would pay this fee.  The contracts are with LGS Natural Gas Company and Entergy New Orleans, Inc.  Kam Keiser (East Risk) has spoken to Scott Neal, and he doesn't believe that the East desk should take the hit for this fee.  Bridgeline is looking for their cash, and I don't want to pay this until we have a deal booked for it.  Do you know where this charge should be booked?  I estimate that we owe Bridgeline approximately $600,000, and need to pay it as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help with this.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

thank you.

Scott
Thanks! I'm in Europe next week, when I get back let's get together for
dinner.

Randy

I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2
resumes
that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives
knowledge and industry experience.  She has
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination
opportunities also.
 <<Beth resume.doc>>

Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.

  <<resume.doc>>

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Executive recruiter in the energy and telecommunications industries.

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest" 

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2
resumes
that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives
knowledge and industry experience.  She has
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination
opportunities also.
 <<Beth resume.doc>>

Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.

  <<resume.doc>>

	please forward to all East traders and originators

Scott, 

Per our conversation, please schedule a room for a 1/2 hour presentation to your group at 3pm on Monday, Nov. 19.  We will cover the current status of the weather market, our current product offerings, target customers, and other opportunities.

See you then.

that sounds great. thank you so much.  see you tomorrow

Hey, there.  You're probably going to need your clothes over the holiday
season.  Why don't I drop them off for you tomorrow morning around 9:15 or
so, and you can have your assistant come down to get them.  Would that work
ok?  No hurry here.  Just thought you might want them.

Learn more about me at:
http://www.tomjames.com/asp/biopage.asp?empidn=05568

As I suggested several months ago you need to get access to TDS with a total position view.  I am well within my VAR.  If I need to be responsible 
for total gas floor VAR let me know.

Scott,
I know/hope you don't hate me and please don't hate me after this,  but we have to do better job estimating our position.  Again we are over our limits.  Lavo is putting pressure on me to do a better job managing/estimating risk on the desk.  "Stress" is high and your help is greatly appreciated. 

Unfortunately, rating agencies are looking at VAR daily.  They believe we have an excellent handle on our risk.  It is critical that we temporary stay our course.  

Thanks for everything. I look forward to working with you on the other side.

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.

I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.

good job, Frank.

Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has exe=
cuted the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, =
I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a m=
ore detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the=
 deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can del=
iver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will giv=
e you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Stati=
on 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at =
an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving =
downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving ups=
tream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta =
65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check=
 with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that=
 this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to=
 clear up any issues with Trigen.

Andy Ring and Sandra Brawner need to be at this meeting.  

Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!

FYI

Tanya,

This is a follow-up to my two calls this morning.  I have talked to Pat Ebert at Ashland.  I asked her why they refuse to pay their October 2001 invoices.  She said that her management wants to speak to someone in upper management at Enron.  I asked to speak to her manager and was told that she was in a meeting.  I asked her to get her out of the meeting.  She did not comply.  Her managers name is Sherry Tackett.  Her phone number is 614-790-6941.  I left her a messsage.  I told her that I expect payment for the ENA upstream, for 559,000+, and for ENA for 374,000+.  I also told her she received to commodity so the payment is due.  I told her  expect it today.  I left my phone number and told her to call me as soon as possible.

Thanks,

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Dear PeeWee Baseball '02 Player:

It's hard to believe that the 2002 SBMSA Baseball season is just around
the corner, but it is!  This year's Skills Evaluations for Westchester
PeeWees (3rd and 4th grades) will be held at the Spring Forest fields on
Saturday and Sunday, February 2nd and 3rd.  More information on this
will be telephoned to each player early next week that will detail the
exact time to show-up.  For those of us, however, that are in need of a
little "warm-up" before the evaluations, informal batting practice
(machine) and fielding drills will be going on next Wednesday and
Thursday (Jan 30 and 31st) at the Spring Forest fields from 6 - 8 pm.
To participate, come by either day (or both) with your glove, bat and
batting helmet.

See you next week,

David Benninger
Westchester PeeWee Commissioner
713/207-1329 (w)
713/984-1572 (h)

victor,

take a look and fill people as you see best.  this is only preliminary so you will have a 
chance to revise if you change your mind.

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.  

sure. Everything looks like it might work out for us in the Trading business.  The bankruptcy court will hopefully approve the sale of the Trading business to
UBS Warburg on Friday.  If all goes well there then I will be working for UBS.  I'll give you a call.

It's great to hear from you.

Tom sent me an email yesterday.  I would encourage you to seriously consider the opportunity.  At this point, I am not sure what my exact needs are in the East, but as we all know things tend to change rather quickly around here.

Let me know if I can help you with your decision.

Scott

Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.

Let me know.

Thanks
chris

I think that would be great.  Let me know if i can help out.  I received an email from Chris also, I will definately encourage him to stay with us.
Just a heads up, I lost Daren Farmer as my Logistics Manager/Transportation person on Thursday.  I have asked Chris if he would be interested.  He said he would give me an answer on Monday.

Tom

Just to follow up on our conversation this morning.  I definately would like to nominate Bob Superty for promotion.  Bob has done  a fabulous job for several years 
managing our overall logistics function.  Let me know if you additional info from me.

Thanks for your help.

Is this correct or was it made in error?  Let me know.
Jeanie,  What I see is a deduction for United Way in the amount of 1500.00 and a deduction for Parking in the amount of 37.00.  Please let me know if he has additional questions.

thanks.

not yet.  will send another email to check on status.  I'll keep you posted.  

Any information yet on the $1537.00 of "Other Deductions" from my 12/31 paycheck?

FYI...Scott/Andy,
Here's an update on the top ten pipelines for NETCO-East.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
THANKS
Victor

Bob, Attached for your review is a summary status report of the top ten pipelines identified by east trading as needing to be up and running as soon as possible for NETCO. Credit, contract, timing and legal requirements are included for review.  Most actions and requests are determined by who the parent company is and how the credit check turns up. That also greatly impacts the turnaround time for service  for us to transact on the pipelines.  I have all hardcopies of necessary forms on my desk.  We can perform the same inquiry and request for the next batch of pipelines that trading identifies as second tier and necessary for trading as we expand.   Please let me know if you need additional information.
THANKS

  

On Monday we have to file a "transition plan" with Louise Kitchen for NETCO. She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)

Tks - Bob

Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden 
Here is a memo we have Intercepted from Osama Bin Laden to all of his
Cavemates. 

Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says "There is no I in team" as well as the one
that says "Hang In There, Baby." That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote "Osama" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots. 

Osama B. 

I don't think so, but I am not exactly sure how the program works.  I believe that you are to be reimbursed at the end of each semester after you receive your grades.  However, you would need to be employed with Enron at that time to be reimbursed.

Hi!,

 Do you happen to know, if I can still get my tuition reimbursement? I heard they are doing expense reports again and isnt that like the same thing?

DOUGLASS AND I ARE LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD MEN TO PLAY WITH ON SAT. MORNING.

I have attached a list of Enron's Top Trading customers who are not doing business on EOL.  Customers designated as Execute are signed up on EOL and can begin transacting if they have suitable credit.  Please circulate this list to your team to push some of these counterparties to begin using EnronOnline.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either myself or Bryan Hull.  Thanks for your help.

 

 

Scott,

I just wanted to let you know what is going on down here. 

1. I will give you a printout of what curves are in what curve files. Currently there are 2 basis files and 1 intramonth. If we need to split out certain curves to individual traders 
and their markets, we can. I just need to know who will be doing what. I think the simplest way to do this is to write the trader's name above the curve name on the printout I give you and I can make the adjustments. I will give this printout to you tomorrow. 

2. We are currently setting up a curve directory that all the traders can get into. This should be set up by tomorrow. Once any adjustments to (if any) the curve files are complete, I will save them to this directory. The traders who will have curve files will need to establish any links, spreads, or etc.  within them. (i.e.. linking one curve to another)

3. I will give the online trading group any product changes that you give me. They should make the necessary changes in the product list.

We plan to load curves Wednesday for testing, so this all needs to be done rather quickly. Thanks for your help. 

Scott

Scott, Thanks again for the trading overview you gave our desk today.  It was a great lead-in to future sessions.  Like we agreed, I would like to have these round table discussions once a month.  I'll check with Kimberly to see what your schedule looks like in the future and schedule them.

East Logistics, Please e-mail Scott or myself with topics for future meetings you would be interested in having Scott talk about. 

THANKS Victor

please see a draft of the proposed rules and trading ticket.  please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I would like Joe Casas (currently East logistics) to participate in the interview process.
We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

Ken,  Please review the attached.

Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on 
Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way

calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I 
prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Dan,  Attached are the latest independent docs with the Collection Facilities 
funding, construction, and fee structure.  I  am working on a form a 
construction agreement which will be attached as an Exhibit to the Field 
Services Agreement.

Dan,  Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes 
we discussed.  As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement 
between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to 
produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached 
agreements.  Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity?

Please review and forward to IPC.  This will be required to commit Niedigger 
gas to our purchasing and field services agreements.

Fine by me.

I would like to take vacation on the following dates:

 July 1 and July 2
 July 8, 9 & 12

Please let me know if these dates are OK with you.

BRENDA:  My first choice for a temp is Chris Koenig, second choice is Terry 
Virgillio (sitting for Erica today).

Here it  is.  Please revise as necessary.

     Gerald,

     Please review the attached files and provide comments by August 9.

     The siteag.doc is a proposed Compressor Site Agreement for the Powder
     River Basin.  This document was given to the ROW contractor by a
     landowner in the area.  In paragraph 6, I removed a sentence
     concerning the obligation to fence the site since we were instructed
     to only build a fence around the Main Station.

     The easement file contains a few modifications to accommodate future
     pipelines.  BLUE is where Ted (ROW Contractor) added something, and
     RED is where Ted suggest the wording be removed.  For example, Item
     #1, (the option) we removed because we are ready to obtain the
     easement, rather than only an option.  Item #16 was added to address a
     future line.

     Sincerely,

     Pam Sherman

David,  Attached is a construction agreement draft for a $750,000 gathering 
system between Sapphire Bay.LLC (of which ECT, Jedi II, and Independent are 
members) and Independent as contractor.  Sappire Bay will own the gathering 
system.

Please give me a call to discuss.

Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review.

Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.  I didn't want 
to forward this one to Hanover.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.  Please review and if it 
looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave.

The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement.

Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is 
any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue.  
Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might 
also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting 
this into a contract is a relatively simple matter.

Gerald,

Do you have any information on the tax gross up percentage for HPL.?  Also,  
is there an established policy for applying gross up to reimbursable 
projects?  
I have not seen any contract language for HPL projects  that address gross up 
as part of the producer's cost.  I have, however, occasionally seen gross up
included on the work order estimate. 

If you have any documentation, would you please forward to me.

Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement?

Gerald,

I am sending up a copy of the proposed contract structure from Continental 
Divide
who is the local power utility associated with the Transwestern Gallup 
station.

Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that 
have
been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or
more apparent.

1) ECS is agreeing to a 3 yr term "to buy power from Continental Divide" 
assuming
     the merger is completed and power is available to ECS through the No. 21 
tariff.

2) They have provided none of the information concerning a split demand 
charge 
      that totals $12.21/kw.  Discussions reflect that $8.86/kw is avoidable 
and tied to
      their monthly coincidental peak load and the remaining $3.35/kw is a 
base type
      demand.  This is the basis of the rebate mechanism for TW.  Note this 
is also
      a Tri-State portion and part of the tariff 21.

3) ECS is aware of more favourable contract structures that Tri-State has 
negotiated
     and wants to maintain the ability to utilize a more favourable 
tariff/contract structure 
     or to negotiate specifics with Continental Divide post the Tri-State 
merger.   We 
     would still be buying from Continental Divide supporting their 3 yr term.

I am trying to get some written specifics from Continental Divide / Tri-State 
relative
to the demand avoidance since they are currently using this structure today.  
I'll let
you know.

Otherwise I wanted to get the document to you for your review.

Thanks

Attached is LOI with our revisions redlined.  Please review and call either 
Mark or myself to discuss.

Here it is.

Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review.

I will be attending.

Dan,  Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.  Let me know if you or 
Kennedy have questions.

Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard 
for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current 
situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break 
down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me 
through those times.

I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, 
helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each 
other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I 
don't have to think about all the pain.

We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just 
letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we 
can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either.  
However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your 
eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), 
but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, 
whatever happens in the near future.

I felt I just to had to write this email.

Attached is the termination letter with my revision.  Both a clean and 
redlined version.

Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes 
the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency 
agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also 
terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review 
and add any comments you have.  Thanks

G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to?

As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing 
real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't 
think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.

I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be 
long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good 
in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty 
good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.  

Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same 
place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State 
game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be 
glad to contribute to the cause.    

Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in.

Dan,  Attached are the 1st drafts.

Dan,  Please disregard the prior draft and use this one.

GT,  The theme of the party sounds excellent.  What time is the party on 
Friday and where does the boat leave?  I may take a day of vacation.  I have 
more than I can probably use this year.

G$

   

Gerald,

How are you brother? I'm doing fine. School is starting this Thursday so I
am working my ass off. Kind of anyway. (You know us state employees) I look
forward to Tailgate number 1. You are welcome to stay with me. Also, I am
having a huge party on a double deck boat. The name of the party is "No Le
Hace 99." That means "it doesn't matter" in spanish. (slang version means
who gives a f___.)The date is September 3rd which is a Friday. See If you
and Lisa can make it. You are welcome to stay at my house.

Talk to you later and Hook em Horns
GT

See attached word doc.

Here it is.

Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review.

Gerald:

Coleman is ready to sign an LOU and begin the contracting phase; I have had 
numerous discussions with Coleman the past five months and they have seen a 
few versions of the attached term sheet.  I cannot remember if Shonnie has 
reviewed any of the term sheets, so I would appreciate it if you could review 
the latest version of the term sheet and share your suggestions.  (The MDQ 
ratchet in the term sheet is admittedly somewhat confusing...but I'm trying 
to limit the amount of MDQ that ECT holds open for these small companies who 
are just now beginning to drill acreage in undeveloped areas.)  

Thanks.

Dan

Greg,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Gateway Interconnect 
Agreement.  Please review before forwarding to Pace to make sure the 
ownership concept is in accordance with your negotiations.  Please call me if 
you have any questions and I will forward the Rio Nogales later today.

Attached is the draft interconnect agreement.

Dan,  Attached are the drafts with the revisions we discussed. Both clean and 
redlined against prior version.

Here they are.  Enjoy.  Call me to go over a few points before we forward to 
Denise.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  

Greg,  Attached is a draft settlement and release agreement for the Westfield 
#1.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note, the 
adjusted invoice is to be attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.

GT,  I will be taking Friday off.  Probably drive in Friday morning or early 
afternoon.  What are your plans that day?  If you need any help setting up or 
anything let me know.

G$

   

g,

The boat leaves at 6:00 pm from Carlos and Charlies. It would help if you
took a  day of vacation. We are going to have a blast. Check at work and let
me know what your plans are.

GT

Mark,  I added Paragraph 3 in Article II to cover any obligations which ECS 
incurs for the drive and WT1.  Please review and if OK I will forward to 
Susan for her review.

Larry,  I made a few changes and filled in the blanks.  Please call me to 
discuss.

Would you please stop wetting your cube and blaming it on me!

I've just got a bill from Enron Property Services here for $150 in water 
damage to my cubical carpet !!  I'll forward it on to you.

Dan,  Attached are the documents with my revsions.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

Please disregard the version I sent about 30 minutes prior and use these.

Dan,  Attached are the drafts with the Collection Facilities language.  Blank 
exhibits for the Security Agreement Form and Insurance requirements.  Will 
forward as soon as I am able to obtain them.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Dan,  Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.  If 
not, I need to see all of them.

Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield 
contract):

1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure.
2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month.
3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment 
(Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above)
4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.

Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure 
Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above 
if not for the Force Majeure event.

Thus, 

5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of 
force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have 
been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption.
6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour 
charge do the following:

 Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times 
(Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is 
the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.

Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we 
need to.  Thanks.

 

I know love isn't enough by itself.  We have to give each other more.  The 
types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.  We have 
focused on material things,  when really more meaningful things, such telling 
the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some 
facet of life are what fills each other.  We are both bright and ambituous 
people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right 
context.  Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and 
wife.  Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, 
sounding boards, lovers,  shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or 
walk hand in hand on the beach.  I want to do these things for you and want 
you to do them for me.   Hope you can think of me.  

Love,
Gerald 

Denise,  

Attached is the agreement with changes redlined.  Please review and call me 
if you have questions.  (713) 853-3512

VALUE AT RISK

 August 25 & 26/September 28 & 29

Can you ....

 Give a precise definition of Value at Risk?
 Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their 
businesses?
 Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging 
products?
 Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping?
 Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling process?
 Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR?

An understanding of Value at Risk (VaR) is rapidly becoming an integral 
business need.  The (2 day) VaR seminar is designed to introduce participants 
to this interrelationship of the many factors that make VaR a dynamic and 
strategic tool.  The program ends with a "hands-on" experience of making a 
simple VaR calculation.

If interested, please register through the Development Center or call the 
Ernie help line at ext. 3-0357.

Has the few changes we discussed.

Meant to copy you on this.  

Has the few changes we discussed.

Please read the attached and respond. 

George,   Please review the attached and let me know if you agree.  Thanks.

Steve, Per our previous discussions, I am preparing to draft assignments of 
the following processing agreements (between 3rd Party Processors and HPLR) 
from HPLR to HPLC.    

 King Ranch Processing Plant
 1.  Gas Processing Agreement between HPLR and Exxon Company USA dated July 
23, 1997
  *  Flow up to 10 mmcf/d (Primary Term to Sept. 30, 1999, then month to 
month)

 2.  Gas Processing Agreement between HPLR, HPLC, and Exxon Company USA dated 
May 20, 1998
  *  Processing for EOG BIG Cowboy Gas currently being purchased up to 70,000 
MMBtu (Primary     Term through October 31, 2003
  *  This agreement originally gave HPLR the processing capacity rights since 
HPLR was    originally purchasing the Big Cowboy Gas under the Excess Gas 
Contract.  This contract has   been terminated and HPLC currently purchases 
this gas.  This processing agreement by its   terms reverts the processing 
capacity rights back to HPLC.  However, I will prepare a    confirming 
assignment of this reversion.

 3.  Gas Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between HPLR, HPLC, and Exxon 
Company USA dated October 4, 1996
  *  Processing for Seumar Cage Ranch Field volumes originally purchased by 
HPLR up to 30,000 MMBtu.        (Primary Term through through March 31, 
2001.)  The Seumar contract has been transferred to HPLC.         That 
portion of the contract governing sales of natural gas liquids from HPLR to 
Exxon will be assign to        HPLC.

UPRC Gulf Plains Processing Plant
 1.  This processing agreement has previously been assigned to HPLC. 
==============================================================================
==========================
George,  
Please confirm the above wrt HPLC currently purchasing all the production at 
Big Cowboy and Cage Ranch.  

Karry, 
 Please re-confirm that the above are all the active processing agreement we 
currently have with 3rd Party Plants.

Please let me know if there are any comments or issues with regard to such 
assignments.  Along with such assignments, notification of assignment letters 
will be prepared and forwarded to Exxon.  

Here it is.

 - 0096238.DOC

David,  Please review the attached document, specifically Section 6.7.

Attached are the changes we discussed today.

Rude Dog,

Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the 
edge.

Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about 
Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the 
starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some 
pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we 
don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game.  
But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.

The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me 
comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. 
are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we 
come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending 
Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the 
fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good 
one.  

Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian 
women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.

Well, only 4 more days to go until kickoff.  What do you think about the 
game?  I saw that we are 9.5 point favorites.  I personally would love to win 
by that much.  NCSt.'s passing attack really scares me.  I guess I still 
don't have a lot of confidence in our CBs yet.  I think that Jammer and 
Jackson(from what I have read) are solid in the middle and our front 4 is 
just plain stout.  We have alot of depth at LB as well, so I guess we will 
need to get maximum pressure on  Barnette to help out JW, EH, AB, & RB.  
Offensively, from what I have been reading, it sounds like Applewhite has 
been very sharp and our RBs aren't going to be as weak as I first thought.  
Also, I understand the OL is coming along quite well.  

So, do we win?  How do you see the game unfolding?  I won't get it out here, 
but I will try to listen to it on the internet.  I can't wait to get back and 
watch these games!

Talk to me Goose.

Bruce

I recieved both documents.  Thanks.

Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new 
Collection Facilities Agreement.  The Collection Facilities Agreement has the 
insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.  I will forward the 
Security Doc. shortly.

Attached is the security document form.  Section 5.4 is missing and I will 
provide tommorrow.  However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the 
agreement for review.

GT,   I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.  I plan on driving in Friday 
night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.  If its okay I'll crash at 
your place.  Let me know how your schedule looks. 

Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35.  
Interested? 

This version includes the Section 5.4 language.

Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder 
River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I 
added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized 
at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the 
units contracted for during the initial 2 year period.  

Kay, Please review the attached data sheet and let me know if there are any 
problems.  Thanks.

Attached are the executable documents

Bob,  Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.  Please fax 
signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete 
contracts to me at:

EB3883 
1400 Smith
 Houston, Tx 77002   

Thanks for your help.

G,  I will be there about 9 pm tonight.  My cell phone # is 281-772-9250

I am fedexing the form of lease this morning.  Sorry for the delay.

Oooouch!    That one hurt.  We really kicked their butt all over the field.  
The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.  I don't think he had one 
completed on him all night.

What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team.  
I am trying not to get too down about this.  This is  a young team that is 
going to make mental errors and they will improve.  I still thinks we will 
have a good season. 

The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.  He looks fast out 
there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.  He also got some 
snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding.  
Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles.   

Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.  He look big and fast and gets 
yardages running in the interior.  Ike left a defender looking really stupid 
on his long TD run.  Sweet moves.  Hodges look about like he did last year.  
Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well.

OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford.   The thing I really like 
was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and 
that he will insure that they get fixed.  Mackovic would have made excuses 
that essentially put the blame elsewhere.   This season could be an up and 
down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.

Did you get any info on the game?

G,   

I was thinking of bringing along a friend from Enron to the boat party.  
Unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party 
ratio.  He is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you 
and me.  His wife is out of town this weekend.  He won't mind sleeping on the 
floor.  

Thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend.  Lisa is a really cool 
girl.  You two will have fun together.    

Attached are the latest versions.  Call me if you have any questions (713) 
853-3512.

Mark,  Attached are the letter agreement and Purchase and Sale Agreement.  
Please review.  Note there is a blank date in the letter agreement which 
needs to be provided.  If OK I will forward to TW.

Attached are the latest versions.  Call me if you have any questions (713) 
853-3512.

Clean and redlined of final version

FYI Attached is the latest Enron Compression Services Company structure.  

Here it is G.

Attached is a revised LOI for WT1.   I took out all the language concerning 
materials and equipment obligations incurred by ECS.  After talking with 
Knippa, I understand that after the sale of the motor to TW, they will be 
doing all of the installation.  Please review and provide comments.

No problem.  I will review these and get back with Cheryl.  Thanks.

Attached are some letters that Cheryl King from HPL has prepared. I think it 
would be more appropriate for you ( or someone from your group) to OK these 
as from reading the email, I gather that you do the legal work for HPL. 

Can I leave it with you to get with Cheryl King? 

Many thanks,

09/01/99 10:43 AM
Here they are.  I will probably hear from Kathy later today as to whether or 
not they need any changes.

Since HPL Resources & Houston Pipe Line have several RRC System Numbers, the 
2nd attachment is the exhibit that goes with the 1st letter.  But, ECT only 
has one RRC System Number since they don't own any pipe, so that letter 
doesn't need an attachment.

Connie,

I just wanted to let you know that since I was already working with the 
Railroad Commission (RRC) to get HPL Resources Company automatically replaced 
with Houston Pipe Line Company as purchaser on the P-4's, I went ahead & 
drafted a letter to do the same for the change from ECT to Enron North 
America Corp.  I faxed both letters to Kathy Way at the RRC, who is 
responsible for all automatic P-4 changes.  She will let me know if the 
letters look okay.  If so, I will need to get the appropriate officers to 
sign them & send them to her at the RRC.  Since she only does this at the 
beginning of the month & doesn't backdate the effective date, the change will 
The current P-5's are filed thru Gerald Nemec's office.  Will they be filing 
for this new one?  If not, do you want me to pursue this?  Please let me know 
so that we can get this completed in a timely manner.

Thanks.

Cheryl King     -     EB3765     -     x-36982

I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment 
would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and 
ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any 
questions, please contact me a x33512.

whenever and be in Austin to help you out with the pre-party perparations.  

G.

His name is Eric Gillaspie.  We will be at your casa shortly after 12.  
Looking forward to it.

Gerald,

I plan on taking off at noon so meet me at my house around then. Is your
buddy coming and what is his name? I need it for our list.

Cheryl,  We will handle the name change for ECT to ENA on the P-5 form.  

Mary,  When you get a chance, come be and let's talk about what need to be 
done.

Cheryl D King
09/02/99 01:49 PM
FYI:

The HPLR to HLPC change isn't a name change.  It is just numerous assignments 
from HPLR to HLPC.  From what I've been told, HPLR is still a good company 
for now.

As far an an effective date, the actual name change from ECT to ENA is 
effective 9/1/99, but since we don't already have our paperwork into the RRC 
requesting the automatic P-4 change, the RRC will make it effective 10/1/99, 
provided we have all of our paperwork into them before then.

The date of most of the assignments from HPLR to HPLC (some via ECT first) is 
7/1/99.  But, again, as far as the P-4 changes are concerned, the RRC will 
make them effective 10/1/99, since they don't backdate automatic changes.

I spoke to Kathy Way at the RRC again this morning.  She said that the 
letters are fine from their perspective.  I just need to get the appropriate 
signatures & mail them to her.

But, they can't do anything with the ECT to ENA changes until ENA has a valid 
P-5 number.

QUESTION:  Will your office be doing the paperwork to get a P-5 number for 
ENA?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

   

I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment 
would be to add an effective date of the name change from HPLR to HPLC and 
ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any

Dear Gerald,

In response to the recent business reorganization, we are working to=20

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate addresses across Enron's Global Messaging Enterprise. Some of you=

may find that your original  Internet "short name" was changed as a result =

your short name being the same as someone else's at Enron.   In addition to=
=20
changing to a standard "@enron.com" we have made a global change to allow=

users to receive email  by short name and long name (see below).

This consolidation will become effective for all former ECT users, beginnin=
g=20
Monday, September 6, 1999. =20

 Internet short name:  gnemec@enron.com

initials.
i.e. John.A.Doe@enron.com

Your old "@ect.enron.com" and "@enron.co.uk" addresses will continue to be=

When ordering your new business cards, we are recommending that users begin=

If you have additional questions regarding your new address, please contact=

your local help desk.

Thank You for your support in this global messaging endeavor.

Just working on a Courtney deal while thoughts of you pop into my head.  One 
of the things I really love about you is how humble you are.  You are 
beautiful, confident, and intelligent, and yet you don't act like you know 
that.  I sincerely have always felt lucky to be with you.

Terry,  Attached is a PSA form we have used before with the perspective of 
Enron as buyer.  Probably a little more detailed than we need for this one 
since the facilities are only estimated at $200,000. Kennedy Oil is Seller 
and Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C. is Buyer.

Some further detail on the site lease agreement:

CounterParty is Black Hills Trucking, Inc
Initial 1 year term, then month to month up to 2 years total
Fee $800/month
Black Hill will provide phone and electricity service hookup and Enron to 
reimburse
Enron will directly pay phone and electricity bills

Rude-Dog,  Are you there?

GT,   Great party.  Looking forward to the next one already.

I think I left my cell phone charger in your apartment on your table.  If I 
did, just hold it.  I'll be back for Rice and pick it up then.  If not, I 
must have lost the damn thing somewhere else.

From the Oklahoma 100:

                                  

                 "Waylon Turdsby, star TE from the reigning 3-A champion 
Chickasha
                 Fighting Chick-Peas gave the Sooners a verbal commitment by 
letter
                 late Wednesday according to OK100 sources. This is a big 
boost to
                 the Sooners who were competing with Tulsa, Anadarko Junior 
College
                 and out of state powerhouse Kansas for his services. Waylon, 
who is
                 6'2", 218lbs and runs a 4.75 40 chose OU because "They serve 
fried
                 pork rinds in the cafeteria and the chicks there dig mullet 
hairdos".
                 Waylon plans to study business and eventually take over the 
family
                 used car dealership. Waylon added "My daddy says he has done 
a lot
                 of business with Sooner coaches and boosters over the years 
and that
                 OU would be the best place to refine my used car selling 
skills." The
                 great traditions of OU were also a factor according to 
Waylon, "They
                 have this great tradition where they touch all the movie 
posters of OU
                 legend Brian Bosworth before running out onto the field. You 
just don't
                 get that kind of inspiration outside of OU."

legal is included in Corporate.  We'd really like to have you attend our 
campaigner training session Monday.  See the details below and let me know if 
you can make it.  If you can't attend, I will send you instructions on what 
to do.  Mainly, it's distributing pledge cards to employees in your group and 
following up to see if they've turned in their cards.  I look forward to 
meeting you.

ACTION REQUIRED!

You've been selected by your department head to be a United Way campaigner 
for employees in your group.  We are delighted to have you as a participant 
and look forward to working with you on this year's United Way campaign.  
We're already off to a great start with the solicitation of Enron's executive 
group.  You are the important link to employees, so your role as a campaigner 
will help Enron to achieve its 1999 United Way goal, which is $2,044,000.

We are hosting a training session for all Corporate Staff campaigners Monday, 
September 13, from 11:30 am. to 1 p.m. in EB47C2.  EatZi's will provide a 
delicious hot lunch and we, your hosts, along with a representative from 
United Way, will provide the "entertainment" -- giving you helpful tips on 
how to be a successful campaigner for Enron's United Way campaign.  We also 
will answer any questions you might have.

R.S.V.P. to Mary Clark by email or voicemail (3-7325) no later than Friday, 
so we can give a headcount to Eatzi's.   We do apologize for the short 
notice.  If you cannot attend, don't worry, we will send you the campaigner 
training materials.  

Thanks for your support.

The operations information you requested should now be directed to Robert 
Morgan in Facility Planning.  I forwarded the sheets you left in my office 
last week to Robert for his review.  I handled this request before when I was 
in Facility Planning, but Robert has now taken my place.  Shonnie Daniel will

Shonnie Daniel asked me to forward the attached document to each of
you.

(See attached file: ROWServices.doc)

Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
understand this after things have happened.

I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely 
work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You 
are my one true love.

Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 
11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.  Hopefully you can redline 
it against your old version.  

Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.  I think 
is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises 
for some time and we are not sure what is out there.

The easment was sent off for recording, but I have not recieved the recorded 
copy from the county yet.  As soons as I receive it, I will forward to John.

Cheryl Lantz Marshall on 09/15/99 09:54:11 AM
Did we record the new easement for the Bayport Celanese measurement station 
project?  If so, could you get a copy of the recorded easement to John Towles 
in ROW so they can file it.  Thanks!

The detail that we currently have on the interconnect for Mary Jo Johnson.

Gerald -

Here is a copy of the scoping document that I passed along to Glenn Gregory.

Thanks,
Chris Sonneborn
Glenn,

Mary Jo Johnson is working on a facilities agreement with Mobil to 
interconnect the Spanish Camp 6-inch line to the Mobil 14-inch Vanderbuilt 
pipeline.  HPL will be responsible for setting a 6"x6" tee, riser, and 
above-ground valve on the Spanish Camp lateral.  I suggest the 6x6 because 
the gas sales contract that will go along with the facilities agreement 
should specify an HPL scheduled delivery rate from 0 to 20,000 MMBtu/d.  The 
6-inch will minimize pressure losses off of the Spanish Camp line and will 
maximize our ability to expand this point in the future, if necessary.  
Assume that we will need to acquire a small section of surface easement for 
the above-ground valve.

Looking at our as-built drawings (HC-1025-09-H) it appears that the Mobil 
line crosses the Spanish Camp 6-inch at Station Plus 77+40 in the middle of a 
pasture.  I spoke with Lonnie earlier today, who said that he would be in 
that area on Wednesday and can verify that I have correctly located the 
line.  The crossing pipeline is incorrectly identified as a 16-inch Natural 
Gas line on the as-built.

Mary Jo has asked for some agressive timing on setting the tee, in that she 
would like to have it set for an 1 October, 1999 completion date.  In that 
light, would you please approach this from the perspective of preparing a 
work-order rather than a preliminary cost estimate.

If any of these specifications change, I will let you know immediately.

Thanks,
Chris Sonneborn

Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Assignment and 
Prearranged Release Agreement and the Trailblazer PA Assignment Agreement.  
The documents have been revised to reflect the amendment to Transaction No.1 
to increase the DCQ by 6, 195 MMBtu per day.  A few other cleanup changes 
were also made.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  
(713) 853-3512.

Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?  If so did they recommend this 
specific language?

Please find attached the latest draft of the proposed Capital Construction 
Term Rate Agreement with Sofregaz US.  I have not yet sent these changes back 
to Sofregaz yet.  Our (EECC) legal department approves these changes, but I 
wanted to make sure Gerald and Enron Storage Co. approved these changes.  The 
only changes made were to Section 19, General Indemnity.  This is a 
comparison copy showing the changes from our standard Capital Construction 
Agreement.

Gerald, the contract is with EECC, but Enron Storage Co. could use an 
Affiliate Work Offer.  I just realized that there is no Exhibit showing the 
Work Offer form, so I will correct that and make the work offers Exhibit F. I 
will attach a copy of our affiliate work offer for your review.

Please get back to me with any comments.  I will then reply back to Sofregaz.

Thanks.

LoneMountain/Premier - MMBtu
National Fuels - MMBtu
Northstar - MMBtu
Tom Brown - Based on their stated intent to renegotiate
Trend- MMBtu

allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have 
reviewed and executed yet?  

Jack,  Attached is the Release, Settlement, and Termination agreement we 
discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is the final version.  Please forward to Black Hills.

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

I'll check the Global Database to see if I can find it.  Did Shonnie paper 
that purchase agreement?

Lauri,  I reviewed the contract with TGLO.  It is a standard interruptible 
form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows.  I also 
talked further with Dan concerning the contract.    We feel that the 
agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the 
state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts.  Thus, we 
would consider HISD to not be state facilities.  This argument is not a slam 
dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.  The 
contract also refers to gas "destined" for state facilities.  So the fact 
that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state 
facility does not matter.  It ultimately is "destined" for state facilities.

Hello,

I work in Applications Integration on the GEM Project (Windows 2000 
rollout).  It is our mission to ensure that all applications are tested and 
packaged for use with Windows 2000 so that the Enron user community can be 
migrated to Windows 2000.  I am contacting you because we have identified the 
current version of HTS32 as not compatible with Windows 2000 and I found your 
name in the application group as one of the users of this application.

I need your help in gathering the following information:

Who is the "owner" of this application (the person who can tell me if it is 
still needed)?

Is it still used?

Has it been replaced by another application or a web based application?  If 
so, when and which application?

If it is still used:

Vendor (or developer) name?  (please include any contact info. you may have: 
web site, contact, phone number).

Who can work with me to obtain the new version (if needed) and test it?

Who uses it (if this list is too large, just note the approximate number of 
people)?

Do you foresee that this application will go away in the next couple of 
months? 

Is your maintenance contract up-to-date?

Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

Howard Petty

Attached for your review are drafts of the Capacity Assignment and Release 
Agreement and the Transaction No. 1 attached to the Master Firm Purchase Sale 
Enfolio.  

Peter,  any input you would have on Article 3 of the Assignment Agreement 
would be greatly appreciated.  Stephanie is trying to get these out as soon 
as possible tomorrow.

Stephanie,  attached are redlines for your review.  I will also send an email 
with clean copies that you can forward to Calpine.

Attached are the assignment agreement, the Enfolio, and the Confirm.

You had asked for more information regarding Canadian renewal rights. I found 
language in tariff in Transcanada's website (www.transcanada..com) under the 
following:

NOVA FTS-R, Sec 12, FTS-D, Sec 10
BC system, Sec 4.9

Bottom line: 12 month notice prior to end of term. Once notice given, 
irrevocable! Must extend for at least one year.

Please call if you have questions.

Please call if you have any question.

Brant,  The following are my responses;

1.  We don't have a problem removing fax notice as long as they are willing 
to leave the required termination notice at 5 days.  Since we can't fax 
notice, we will have to mail such notice which will take several days.

2.  We can remove affiliate assignment.  

Sorry about the delay.

Gerald,

Here is their response to our comments.  Not much but take a look:

Under term7:  Notices - unless we include language similiar to...'Fax is 
acceptable as long as the fax is followed by hardcopy documentation and 
effective upon such hardcopy reciept.'  Back to square one.  They don't like 
fax.
Under term 8:  they are objecting to affiliate assignment.  Successor is ok.  
Affiliate assignment is no good.  They would like to take out the term 
assigns.

that is it.

Nope.  Didn't piss me off.  I know how to interpret Mandy talk.   I just have

Attached for your review is the final form of assignment.  The only change 
from the prior version is that the Renewal Notice section was changed to 
reflect that ECC will renew unless Calpine notifies ECC otherwise.  This was 
a point negotiate with Calpine.  We plan on executing these tommorrow morning.

Attached are the executables.  Please note the a redline of the Capacity 
Release and Assignment Agreement is also included.  I cleaned up references 
to the Renewal Notification (which are now the Non-Renewal Notification) that 
were missed earlier in Article 3 and Article 5.   

Please note the Exhibit D of the Enfolio Master also needs to be signed by 
Calpine.

Thanks for your help and quick response on those comments.

	12/29/2000 10:45 AM
		 
Gerald, I have just faxed to you the pages with a few last comments.  They 
relate to the change back to Calpine providing a non-renewal notice rather 
than a renewal notice, because there were a couple of places where the 
reference wasn't caught.

You should have it on your fax now.

Greg

Brant,  Attached is a clean and redlined guaranty with the changes we agreed 
upon.  We still need Hess' address for the notice section.  Sorry about the 
delay.

Dwight,  Attached is a form O&M Agreement that was recently used on power 
project in the US.  This form is very similar to the one you forwarded Steve, 
but is more detailed in the Scope of Services to be performed.  There are 
performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output.  We would have to 
add the steam output.  Should be very similar.  I think this form can be 
turned around to Coogentrix fairly quickly once we establish what the 
performance standards to be met are.  I will be out of the office on Jan.2 
but will be back on Wednesday.  Please review.  I apologize for not getting 
back with you yesterday or today, but unfortunately the Calpine capacity 
assignment has to be signed today and it has consumed my time.  Thanks

Brian,  Mark forward the executed docs. to me.  The Trailblazer Assignment 
was not included.  I have attached the assignment in case you don't have the 
one I forwarded earlier.  Please execute and return.   Also the Amended and 
Restated Transaction No. 2 was initialled, but was not executed.  I am 
forwarding those back to you for execution.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Ken,  Attached is the form of compressor site lease agreement.  Please 
forward to all appropriate ROW agents.  This will be the form for screw 
compressor stations only.  The recips. will be a fee simple purchase and that 
form will follow shortly.

Gerald,

As we discussed earlier, following is a list of the high points agreed upon 
in yesterday's meeting with Hanover.  Hopefully this is enough to get a draft 
of a letter agreement going.

- the compression services agreement will be terminated
- there will be a 90 day transition period starting 1/1/01within which 
Crestone will build up an operations and maintenance strategy
- during the 90 day transition, Crestone will make an election as to whether 
we want all of the O&M, part of it, or recontract with either Hanover or 
another 3rd   party  (basically we want the flexibility to do anything we 
want).
- Hanover will provide to us a rate stucture that will be in effect during 
the 90 day transition.  We talked about covering their costs (under a flat 
monthly fee) plus  a 15 to 20% markup.  We also agreed to meet with them very 
soon to define exactly who does or pays for specific services.
- We will need to address the way new units will be ordered in the future.  I 
have not worked on this yet.
- Hanover made the committment to maximize on line availability of their units
- There will be a 2 year term during which Hanover will be Crestone's 
"preferred provider" of either rented or purchased machines.  This needs to 
be   structrured so that we dont necessarily have to use them.The term will 
start 1/1/01.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if I can fill in some of the details for 
you.

Ken

Brant,  Attached is the executable guaranty with the notice language 
included.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Ken,  Attached are the letter which allow us to disclose certain information 
under the Tom Brown confidentiality agreement to third parties and a nom 
letter for Jan - 01.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Melissa,  What up? Just stuck here working late on a project and thought I 
would drop you a line to see if you were still alive.  Hope you had a great 
Christmas and New Years and were able to enjoy some time off.  I spent most 
of it up here working.  The workload has been incredible.

noted several questions thoughout the agreement that need further

GT,  Hey Bud,  Yea that Holiday Bowl was heartbreaking.  Never seen three TD 
passes dropped.

Unfortunately, I don't have Ernie's number.  He called me one time at about

number.  Typical Ernie.

Steve,  I won't be there, but I did leave Shari a voice mail concerning the 
PGT Transaction we just completed.  The firm PGT capacity is ours through 
Nov. 1, 2008.  The remaining term is being released to Calpine.  The Capacity 
Release was just posted and should be completed by Jan 31, 2001.   I don't 
have a copy of the contract, but Stephanie Miller could provide that if 
needed.  It is a standard FTS-1tariff form.  This transport also backs the 
Canadian Producer Net Back deals.  Peter Keohane would be the one to talk to 
about these producer deals and their relation to the PGT Capacity.

	01/09/2001 01:12 PM
		 
Gerald,
PGT
Can you go? You have the most current understanding of the PGT capacity, its 
current rights and obligations.  I have a meeting at 3:30 that I could cut 
short. What's your view.

Dan,
PG&E Texas (Valero) 
Do you think that all the PG&E Texas transport is relevant to this Bankruptcy 
Due Diligence issue since those assets should now be owned by El Paso? 
Understanding what our rights are or are not as to prior periods imbalances 
would be an interesting bankruptcy law exam given that ENA's been operating 
under an "unexecuted" header/transport contract with PG&E Texas for the past 
2 to 3 years.

Stephanie,  I have the copy of the contract so don't worry about that.  Do 
you know of any other deals with PGT we currently hold?

provisions would be appreciated.  I am trying to prepare a brief for Travis 
by late tommorrow.

Thanks.

Stephanie and Becky,

I need your help with the PG&E credit exposure diligence described in Travis 
McCullough's e:mail set forth below. Could you please forward me (i) copies 
of the Service Agreement, Capacity Release materials and executed PGT 
Agreement for the 67,000 MMBtu of transport acquired in 1998, and (ii) the 
Tariff provisions that deal with the matters described in Travis' e:mail.  
Also, what additional transportation transactions do we currently have on 
PG&E entities.  Do you have a feel for that? We are supposed to be helping 
Credit to get a handle on (a) PG&E exposure and (b) setoff opportunities as 
to such exposure. Of course, Credit would like our input by Friday.  

Thanks for your help.

My asst., Kaye Ellis, will be calling each of you this morning to see if you 
can attend a short meeting today to discuss a due diligence effort with 
regard to Pacific Gas  and Electric Company and its various subsidiaries.  We 
have an overall exposure report from Credit which shows that Enron is exposed 
to PG&E in virtually all of the commodities that we transact. 

In the meeting today - Travis and I will help you identify the PG&E 
entity/entities which may have transactions with Enron concerning your 
particular commodity. We will ask you to pull the relevant master agreement 
and provide the information set forth below. 
Thank you in advance for your help,

Attached is the bilateral CA form for Universal Mark and I discussed.

Travis, will be receiving a matrix from outside counsel.  Let's gather the 
information but don't follow Sherry's form yet.  We will use this matrix when 
it is received.  Looks like we also have other contracts.  I will let you 
know when I receive the other contracts.

	Travis McCullough
	01/10/2001 08:49 PM
		
Thanks very much for the information on the PGE trading contracts.

Outside counsel is developing a form of "matrix" that they would like us to 
complete on each of the contracts.  I expect that you will have already done 
most of the work to complete that matrix with respect to your contracts, but 
we will need your help in completing the matrix and possibly digging up some 
additional information.  I will forward the matrix to you when I receive it.

I know how busy everyone is, and really appreciate your prompt response in 
this matter.  As you know, the situation in California is critical, and 
completion of this due diligence effort is key to our ability  to respond to 
the situation.

Based on the current draft of the O&M agreement, we do have the ability to 
(i) terminate each agreement for a one time fee of $200,000, or (ii) suspend 
all or a portion of the O&M services for a period of time and the parties 
would then meet to determine a mutually agreeable adjustment to the then 
current Operating Fee.  Let me know if you have any questions.

In considering the worst case scenario...

The Force Majeure provision seems reasonably broad in the Steam Purchase 
Agreement.  Would we be able to rely on this at some point to suspend our 
steam supply to AKF in the event, for unforseen reasons, we could not obtain 
an Interconnection Agreement or transmission capacity to transport power from 
Elizabethtown and Lumberton?
Also, if it were determined that we could not sell power from the sites, can 
we terminate or downsize the scope of the O&M Agreement?

Stephanie,  Attached is the PA and TSA with my comments redlined.  Before you 
forward to Kern, let's discuss.

Yes,  I was under the weather for a rough 4 or 5 days, but I am pretty much

Hi.  I heard you were sick.  Are you back on the mend?  (Just spoke with 
Bruce -- he told me).  I'm leaving tomorrow to go to the Inauguration in DC, 
but when I get back we'll have to plan on dinner or a movie or something 
fun.  It's been a while.  Maybe those married friends of yours will make us 
dinner???  

Chris,  Attached is the PA with the language we discussed included.

Gerald,

This is Black Hill's proposed changes to the contact for the lay down yard in 
Gillette.   We are already using it and Karl Durant will be in the process of 
getting the office set up and utilities starting Monday 9/27.   We should 
probably move quickly on this.   Thanks again.

Please respond to "mlojo@truecos.com" <mlojo@truecos.com>
Ken,
 My telephone number is 307/266-0319.  I'll try to resend the documents,
but they show they already have the .doc suffix.  If this doesn't work,
I'll fax them down to you.

Ken,  Attached is the revised agency agreement.  I accepted all you changes 
you forwarded earlier and added an indemnity section.  Please review and let  
me know if you want to discuss.

 

I do play guitar, but I am really still just learning.  I can play bit and 
pieces of various songs.  Might be fun to attempt to jam together anyway.  
Are your drums here in Houston?

It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,
-Kevin

Hey Kevin,  How is it going cousin?  Found the napkin that you left your
email address on at Kenneally's.  Man, I really was loaded by the time I
left that place.  I went down to CC the next day and told my parents we had
met.  They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before
Christmas.  Small world!

How's Houston treating you?  Been back to Kenneally's since?  Drop me a
line when you get a chance.

Gerald,

Yes,  It depends on when and how much.  Any details yet?

acceptable forward to Gulf.  In addition to the items you and I discussed, I 
also added an arbitration clause.   This is standard for all Enron deals.

Is this being looked at as an ENA acquistion also, or solely a Crescendo

Clement, Enron Corp. currently has an executed guaranty for up to $12 mil 
which guaranties Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC deals with Superior Natural Gas 
Corporation.  ENA owns 40% of Bridgeline.  The guaranty severally obligates 
Enron Corp. for 40% of the $12 mil and Texaco Inc. for the other 60%.  The 
attached amendment increases the guaranty amount to $25 mil per Superior's 
request.  Please review and if acceptable obtain execution by Enron Corp.  
Please call me at x-33512 with any questions.  

Brant,  This form will probably work for the Texaco guaranty also.  I don't 
have a copy of the Texaco guaranty though and I need to review it to make 
sure it is identical to the Enron form.  Can you obtain a copy for me?

Sorry, Sorry,

I missed your birthday last week.  Hope you had a great birthday with Will 
and his family.  Are things going well in the Big D?  I have been doing 
fine.  Work keeps me pretty busy.  

Happy Birthday!

Bill,  I am forwarding an agreement I have discussed with Susan Clark last 
week.  She suggested I forward this to you.  The attached agreement addresses 
the power line facilities for Enron Compression Services Company's electric 
motor drivers in Florida.  The agreement has been highly negotiated to this 
point, but I wanted to get your general view of the structure prior to 
executing this with Gulf.  We are trying to execute quickly.  Susan could 
give you more context on our situation with Gulf.  Please call me if you have 
any questions (713) 853-3512. 

This doesn't explain Friday night, though.

Attached please find both blacklined and execution of the respective O&M 
Agreements for the 2 facilities, excluding certain exhibits.  Jay Sonneburg 
with Bracewell will be taking the execution copies with him in order to get 
the 2 LLC's signature when Enron takes control of the LLCs.

Jay will attach Schedule 1 to each agreement which is a description of the 
facilities.  My understanding is that Dwight will be forwarding electronic 
versions of Schedule 2 - Permits and Schedule 3 - Budget for both 
agreements.  All other schedules are already attached to the agreements 
themselves.

Because I will be out of the office most of the day tomorrow in meetings and 
Jay will have his hands otherwise very full at the closing, I would suggest 
getting with me asap on Tues. if any material changes are needed.  At this 
point I would not recommend changing any non-material changes.

Chris,  The original transaction agreement were done via fax.  We only have 
fax copies. The two amended and restated transaction agreement #2's he sent 
on Dec. 21 were inadvertently not executed by Huber.  I sent them back, but 
somewhere they got lost in the shuffle.  Let's have him execute the copies 
you left with him.

I have forwarded all the agreements I  have to Gerald.  I assume that there 
is an original of the Transaction Agreement in Houston.  It was done over the

In addition,  Myself and Stephanie need about 15 minutes with you sometime 
this week so that we can transition the Capacity Release activity on WIC to

Gerald/Mark - I dropped off the Huber contracts as follows:

Trailblazer Assignment and Assumption Agreement - dropped off one original 
for execution.  The VP was not there to sign.  We should receive the executed 
original back from Huber this week.  Thereafter, all three originals go to 
Trailblazer for signature.

Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement - gave original to 
Brian Stone.

Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement #2 - Brian stated that he mailed 
the two "Huber" executed originals to Mark Whitt on 12/21/00.  I left the two 
(replacement) unexecuted agreements with him in the event Mark cannot locate 
those mailed in December.  Mark - do you have these?  Let me know ASAP.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase / Sale Agreement - dropped off two originals for 
execution (to replace the fax'd version).  Should get back this week.

Original Transaction Agreement - Brian only has a fax'd copy.  He wants to 
know if there is an original that exists.  Let me know if we have any 
originals or whether the deal was originally done over the fax.

I am open tonight.  Let me know what time you're coming in.  I can help you

G,

I am coming into town tonight. Do you have big plans? I thought we could
hook up for some beers or something and I could crash at your casa.

I need help putting some furniture into  a U Haul tomorrow at Heather's
house in Spring so maybe you could help me and I will by you lunch. I
understand if you are busy. Ernie lives in Tomball. Maybe we can get a hold
of him too.

Let me know dude.

GT

Per our discussion attached is the revised CSA.  I will forward the revised 
Lease and O&M Agreements (reflecting the equipment change) early next week.

Ken,  Attached is a draft of my comments to the gathering agreement.  I have 
made it clear in the language that the agreement is fully interruptible at 
our discretion.  The agreement is still a keep whole on the liquids.  I did 
not change this section.  Also I did not review or change Exhibit A.  I will 
leave that to you.

Barbara,  Attached is the term sheet with my revision.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Attached is a draft Change Order for the Electric Drive Compressor Station.   
Please review. Specifically note the Compressor Contract Price Sheet and how 
Merrick Modified the Target Price definition.  Also I envision using this 
same format for the Dew Point Plant Change Order

.

Staci,  Your proposed language is acceptable.  Thanks for your help.

Gerald --   To address your concerns raised in the proposed rider to 
Paragraph 11.2, we would suggest the following language be inserted as the 
last paragraph in Article XI:

11. __  Shipper retains its rights to raise objections of undue 
discrimination with regard to rates and/or terms and conditions applicable to 
Phase V service on grounds of undue discrimination; provided however, in the 
event Shipper has such objections, Shipper will provide Transporter with ten 
(10) days written notice prior to filing any such objections with FERC.

Attached please find the execution copies of both O&M Agreements.  The only 
change I have made is the one we discussed at the end of Section 8.4.  Please 
let me know if you wish to discuss.

Jay, unfortunately, I would just print out these documents in lieu of the 
hard copies I previously gave you. However, keep and use the budget schedules 
I gave you.

Best regards.

Attached are my comments to the TBI proposal.  Please review and let me know 
if you have any comments.

I also wanted to clarify a point on the Tom Brown form of gathering 
agreement.  The revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage 
dedication.  Since Tom Brown removed all the acreage dedication language, it 
is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage 
dedication.  To the extent we modeled our economics on any Tom Brown 
production, I wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are 
not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by Tom Brown 
to someone else at their discretion.

Per your voice mail, attached is the TBI proposal as revised.

Just when I thought I was rid of the duct tape humor, I get this........

Duct tape is like 'the force'. It has a light side & a dark side, and it
  holds the universe together.

It's not even funny, but I thought you might like it considering your
affection for the stuff.

I have the form that we used for the Enron Amendment, but I need to see a 
copy of the original Texaco guaranty before I can finalize a form for 
Texaco.  Can you provide me a copy of the Texaco guaranty?

Hey Gerald,

Enron Corp. and Texaco Inc. currently have issued $12MM guaranties to 
Superior Natural Gas.  The obligations under the guaranties are several and 
not joint obligations.  The customer has asked that we increase these 
guaranties to $25MM.  Please prepare an amendment to the existing guaranties 
and have Enron execute a hardcopy original, delivering such copy to me at 
2860b.  And, drafting an executable Texaco copy so that I might e-mail the 
request to Texaco for signature.

Thanks for your help.

brant

Thanks for the info.  I will prepare the amendment.  

	Brant Reves
	02/12/2001 10:13 AM
		 
As I reviewed the original request, I realised that I did not correctly 
reference the original $15MM guaranty.  The request was for Exxon Mobil 
Corporation.  Please proceed without further delay from Credit.  I apologise 
for any inconvenience this may have caused.

thanks

02/12/2001 09:20 AM
Any update on status of this request?

Brant Reves
02/07/2001 02:37 PM
Hey Gerald,

Please prepare an amendment to increase the existing $15MM guaranty provided 
by Bridgeline Holdings to $25MM.  Enron and Texaco board members will have to 
sign the amendment.  Please prepare it and forward for the appropriate Enron 
signatures and then have it forwarded it to me, so that I might forward it 
along to Trevor Mihalik who can in turn forward it along to Texaco for final 
signature.

thanks

Greg and SCS recommended we put a cap in for our expenditures on operation 
costs that HPL was willing to eat for the HPL Operated Facilities.  I have 
modified section 5 accordingly for your review:

5. Operation.  RNP shall operate and maintain the RNP Facilities in 
accordance with sound and prudent natural gas industry practice and shall be 
fully responsible for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for 
all cost and expense associated therewith.  HPL shall operate and maintain or 
cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL Facilities in accordance with 
the Standards and with sound and prudent natural gas pipeline industry 
practice and shall be fully responsible for the operation and maintenance 
thereof and for all cost, expense and risk associated therewith.  HPL shall 
operate and maintain or cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL 
Operated Facilities in accordance with the Standards and with sound and 
prudent natural gas pipeline industry practice and shall be fully responsible 
for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for all cost, expense 
and risk associated therewith, except RNP shall be fully responsible for any 
cost and expense associated with any repairs, maintenance, and capital 
expenditures that are in excess of $3,000.00 for a single item (the 
"Maintenance Items").  HPL shall invoice RNP for the Maintenance Items 
performed by HPL on the HPL Operated Facilities, and RNP shall pay such 
invoice within 15 days of its receipt thereof.  RNP shall be responsible for 
any Meter Fee assessed, as defined in Section 3 above, and for the electric 
power and phone service, required for the Interconnect.

Gerald,
I have converted the draft joint petition that was faxed to you earlier this
afternoon from a WordPerfect file to a Word file.  The converted document is
attached.

As we discussed, we are hoping to receive both your feedback and the
additional information you have agreed to provide ASAP.  We are trying to
work on finalizing the document in time to work out the logistics for filing
by the end of this week.

Our goal is to try and have a signed document in our possession early Friday
morning so that it can be carried to Tallahassee for filing at the FPSC
later that morning.  One of our executives is traveling to Tallahassee that
day for a meeting and has agreed to serve as a courier if the document can
be completed in time.  As we also discussed, if you have Tallahassee counsel
available to sign the final, we can make arrangements to carry the document
to them for signing on Friday and still make the filing on Friday as
desired.

Tim has sent you the original letter agreements and contract for electric
service via FedEx for signing.  Upon execution of the originals, please
return two executed copies to us via FedEx.  This should allow us to have
the executed documents in our possession by Friday, February 16.  Of course,
the documents should be dated 2/13 and signed by the same individual who
signed the fax copies that were returned to us earlier today.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at
850/469-3313 or Tim Anthony at 850/444-6678.  One of my partners is also
working on the joint petition.  His name is Russell Badders.  In case you
need to speak to someone when you cannot reach me, Russell can be reached at
850/469-3316.

We appreciate your efforts as we continue to work together to make this
project happen.

Thanks!

I booked the reservation below through my Frito-Lay travel agency.  I think I
can probably book you another room at the same rate if you'd like.  This is 
for
the Marriott Capital for $129 a night.  The Sheraton rooms would have been 
$125
but they were sold out.  The Marriott is actually closer to the reception (2
blocks) than the Sheraton, so we'll be able to walk over.

Let me know and I'll try to get another room.

Please hold this very important date on your calendar!  On the evening of 
September 28, Tuesday,  beginning at 6pm we will celebrate the successful 
closing of Project Kachina with cocktails and dinner.   Invitations with 
details to follow.

Attached are the Enfolio and GISB Spot Contracts.  Let's discuss.

Did you make it to work ok this morning?  I am extremely because somebody 
kept me up late last night. Not that I am complaining.  Probably not going to 
do some of my finest work today.

Seriously, I had a great time last night.

We finally had a conversation with Bill Garner at Petrie Parkman late
Wednesday afternoon, 2/21/01.  Tom Brown representatives are not discussing
the status of the WEP acquisition with any entities.

Bill informed us that they are in negotiations with a single entity for the
entire Wildhorse Package as included in the data room plus some additional
Colorado assets that were not included in the package.  Bill also informed
us (and the reason he returned our call) is that he indicated he believes
the entity would be "friendly" to Crescendo  and has expressed interest (to
them) in "working with us" on our project and plans.  We reminded him that
there are still issues with our existing contract that need to be
expediently resolved, and we aren't going to wait 6 months to resolve these
issues.  He assured us that Tom Brown is very aware of contractual issues.
He indicated that the entity wanted to contact Crescendo now (before
execution of the PSA), but TBI insists on working through PSA issues before
contact with Crescendo.  A PSA review meeting is scheduled for next week.
Bill said he would make introductions for us as soon as the PSA is executed.

Bill also informed us that it was TBI management that made the decision to
sell all the assets instead of breaking up, even if breaking up brought a
higher sale price.

Staci,  Attached is the final draft of the petition we are jointly filing 
with Gulf Power Company.  The plan is to file it tomorrow in Tallahassee.  I 
will get with you shortly on finalizing the CSA amendments.

Mark,  Attached is the confirm for the Nymex.  I revised it to reference the 
new master to be signed this month.

Mark,  Attached is the confirm with my revisions.

Mark,  Attached is the revised confirm.  I added a provision which requires 
AEC to execute a new master as soon as reasonably possibly and upon such 
execution this TA and all TA's between AEC and ENA in place will be governed 
by the new Master.  Let me know if that meets your understanding.

That's disgusting.

I usually don't forward e:mail messages en masse.  I made an exception in 
this case because I found the issue compelling. I also found completing and 
submitting my responses to the attached survey to be quick and straight 
forward.

I hope you will take a few moments to consider the attached tax survey and 
respond according to your convictions.

** 2nd Alert from MillionsofAmericans.com**

President George W. Bush needs your help to build more
support for his tax cut proposal.

In the last week or so two Republican Senators (Lincoln
Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont) have
withdrawn support for the Bush plan.

Two more GOP moderates (Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and
Olympia Snowe of Maine) are threatening to oppose the bill
if major details of the tax cut are not changed.

Remember, the U.S. Senate is split 50-50.  That means every
Republican vote we lose and every Democrat vote we gain is
absolutely critical.

Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) has been
called upon to help make sure the President's plan gets
through Congress.

One way they're going to help President Bush is by
convincing Senators who are on the fence that a majority of
American taxpayers -- like you and me -- want them to stand
firm on the key points.

To accomplish this goal, ATR put together a quick taxpayer
survey on their web site.  The results of this survey will
be presented to every U.S. Senator and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert.

Here is a link: http://www.atr.org/A426.htm

Here is a list of their questions:

#1 Do you support tax cuts for all Americans?

The Democrats in Congress want targeted tax cuts for people
who meet certain income and behavioral categories.
President George W. Bush has proposed cutting everybody's
taxes.

#2 Should we kill the Estate Tax (also called Death Tax)?

You pay taxes all of your life. Should your loved ones be
forced to sell off your family business, family farm or
heirlooms to pay up to 55% in taxes when you pass away?

#3 Should we abolish the marriage penalty?

Right now, our government is punishing couples for
getting married by bumping them into higher combined tax
brackets.

#4 Do you favor making the tax cuts retroactive to Jan 1st
2001?

President Bush's proposed tax plan provides relief to our
families and stimulates our economy right now by making tax
cuts retroactive to the beginning of this year.  That way
you'd see your tax cut in this year's paychecks.

Each of these questions are up for debate over the next few
weeks and months while Congress decides the exact size and
scope of the tax cut.

I strongly encourage all taxpayers to stand up and be
counted by visiting the ATR web site and answering these
questions.

In addition to providing the survey results, Grover wants to
be able to show our leaders in Congress that hundreds of
thousands of Americans participated in this survey --
so please take a minute to respond and SPREAD THE WORD!!!

Here is the link again: http://www.atr.org/A426.htm

Check it out.

For Integrity,
Bruce Eberle
MillionsofAmericans.com

PS: Full details of President Bush's tax cut plan are available at the ATR
site.

Gerald,

I am sending you the PSA and Escrow agreement for the acquisition of the
Harley Dome Oil and Gas Leases.  This lease contains mostly helium reserves,
with little oil or gas value.  We plan to execute this PSA with the Oil and
Gas Owner next week, and put the downpayment in escrow at our bank here in
Midland.  We expect a due diligence period of 1-2 months, due to waiting on
the outcome of the lawsuit involving the helium rights owner or agreement on
a deal with the helium rights owner.  There are no producing wells on the
acreage (all P&A'd or TA'd).  We would do some due diligence upon execution.

Scott asked me to have you look at the agreement.  We have worked with Bill
Ward at Pruitt, Gushee, & Bachtel (PG&B) on this agreement (it is pretty
much our standard PSA), and he looks at all our agreements. I believe PG&B
has been approved by ENA.

The strategy here is that if we obtain the oil and gas rights, then we
believe we lock up the oil and gas leases covering the existing helium
rights owned by another entity. We are using this as leverage to get a
better deal from the helium rights owner.

As listed in Article 7.7, the acquisition wouldn't close until final
approval by members of Crescendo.  We are prepared to risk (and its not
really even at risk based on the termination provisions in Article 10)  the
$12,000 downpayment to work a deal with the helium rights owner.

Let's discuss ASAP.
Thanks, Ken

Anyway, hope you got all your songs downloaded last night and got a good
nights sleep.  No more cramps for me last night.  I was very excited.

Have a great day at work and I will talk with you a little later!  Also, I
will find out what the definite plans are for Saturday night.  Like I said
last night, the whole little birthday party may never come around.  We may
have to be creative on our own!

Mark,  I talked with Jeff Stone this morning concerning the petition.  The 
petition did not get filed on Friday as planned.  Jeff had left for 
Tallahassee prior to the FEDEX arriving on Friday morning.  They also wanted 
to have Katz-Kutter (our counsel in Fla.) sign the transmittal letter for the 
petition prior to sending.  This way the petition is sent by the customer and 
not the utility.  Bill Bryant at Katz-Kutter was unavailable Fri.  Jeff 
assured me that they will get this filed today.  I asked him to call me once 
filed.

We need to start thinking about the best way to approach WFEC after this 
petition is filed.  It sounds like Alabama Electric Cooperative is the way to 
approach this.  Do we know someone in our power trading group who works with 
AEC?   Might be useful to approach it through that relationship.

Ernie,  How is it going?  Did you have a good weekend?  I actually had to 
work for part of it, so my weekend wasn't all that great.

Were you able to book a room for me?  Wanted to be sure that was taken care 
of.

Can I book one more room at this rate on this reservation (same card number),

Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting into 
Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281) 772-9250.  
If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't you just 
call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll ride 
over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.  My 
latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The wedding is at 7.

Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

Gerald,

Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129 rate.  Below
you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it matters which
one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.  They're both on
my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from SA.  I
estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00 right?)  We'll
actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family from the
Valley will be there as well.

If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at the hotel
sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding together 
from
there.

In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got him a gift
yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Andrew,  Attached is a rough draft of the CSA.  I am still reviewing the 
version, but it is substantially correct.  In the interest of time I am 
forwarding this for your review.  Please note Section 3.4.  I am a little 
concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint.  I am trying 
to find local counsel in Pa to review this section.  Please review and lets 
discuss.

Mark,  Please review my attached change to the confirm.  This makes it clear 
that if we don't like their changes to the Master we will not accept them and 
the existing Master still governs.  If acceptable I will forward back to AEC.

Russell,  AEC is reviewing the Master and indicated they would have comments 
within a week or so.  The plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up 
with the new master.  The credit language that was in the earlier version has 
been removed.

I know.  It seems as though Mr. Rudy is in love, so damned the consequences!!

I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly 
possible.  For who can think of work when one so lovely as Barbara awaits.  I 
can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms. 
Waldrop from those two known as Steve and Gina, and we will abound on towards 
fate.  Perchance it might be best for Barbara to come seek me out, as I am 
adrift without direction to the place where Steve and Gina reside.

Yours truly,
Gerald

Where is my "heartfelt and meaningful" e-mail?  I have been waiting all day!

So, what time are you planning on leaving work?  I am leaving here at 5:30
and heading over to Steve and Gina's to change and walk their dog.  I have
already taken Sophie over there.  That way I don't have to go home and then
come back all the way over here.  Do you want to come over to Steve and
Gina's or do you want me to come by and pick you up?

Hope you are having a good day.  Talk with you soon!

I am doing well.  Staying busy with work as usual.  Wow, your new job sounds 
like fun.  I wouldn't mind going to NYC once in a while.  I am around next 
week.  Maybe we could grab lunch or a happy later next week.  Let's talk 
early next week.

I've decided that Bruce is ready to be in love and ready to get married and 
if you're cute and smart then look out!  Seriously, I hope it all works out.  
I for one, would not be so quick to move in but what the hell do I know?  

Work is crazy.  I left EGM and am back at Corp working on the CA energy 
crisis.  It's fun, but I'm traveling every week again.  Off to NYC tomorrow.  

Law school applications are in and now I just wait to hear back.  I'm so glad 
to have that off my plate!!  It's incredibly time consuming.  

How are you?  We need to go out and catch up.  This week/weekend is sort of 
crazy but maybe next week.  Are you around? 

	Gerald Nemec@ECT
	02/27/2001 11:06 AM

application going?

Our friend is living in sin. 

Ann,  Attached is the confirm with revisions.  I tweaked the language to make 
it clear that the transaction is governed by the existing master until we get 
the new one executed.  Please review and if OK, I can prepare executables for 
signature.  Please keep me updated on the status of the review of the new 
master.  Thanks.

Please review Section 7.3 and 7.4 closely.

I will be sending the revised LOI shortly.

7:00 pm is fine and I knew you still had a thing for David.

	02/27/2001 03:20 PM
		 
Very good.  I am very proud of your e-mail.  I was laughing but was very
impressed by it.  I think I should get those often.

How about I come by and pick you up this evening.  How does 7:00 sound?  Will
that be enough time for you to leave work and get home and change into your
leather Rockies?  By the way, I am not wearing those tonight.  I have decided
to break you into the cowboy scene slowly.  Instead, I will be wearing my
wranglers.  We will save the Rockies for when David is around!  I actually
believe that I will be wearing those Thursday night.  That way, you won't be
slapping me on the behind in the suite and trying to embarrass me.

Let me know about the time and I will see you this evening.

Andrew,  Attached is the form of LOI for your review.

Mike,  I never did receive a executed copy of the Master and Transaction 
Agreement between EES and Enron Compression Services Company.  Do you have a 
copy and could you send it to me?

so?

Hey Dena,  

Thanks for accompanying me to lunch today.  I really enjoyed our 
conversation.  You are very charming.  The rest of this week is pretty crazy 
and I am going to Austin for my friends wedding this weekend, but would you 
be interested in getting some dinner sometime next week?  Maybe Wed. or 
Thursday evening?   

Gerald

That's fine.  Actually I really need to catch up on my sleep and my Napster 
downloading.  Have fun with your friends and I'll chill out at my crib.  
Yes,  my face has taken a beating in recent months.  Tell Casey I will live.

Hey there!

I just got a call from some friends that I have not seen in a while and they
wanted to meet for dinner.  However, it won't be until 8:00 or after.
So...would you be upset if I changed my plans for tonight (actually, the
plans are not 100%, however, I did not want to call you at the last minute).
Hopefully you will see this as an opportunity for you to get some sleep.  If
all works out, I should be home by about 10 and if you are interested in
coming over then...you are more than welcome to!  Or..we can let the
excitement of seeing each other build up and let you have sweet dreams about
the leather Rockies.  Just kidding.  Anyway, let me know your thoughts.

Also, Casey came by my office today and expressed her apologies about burning
your face and wanted me to tell you how sorry she was.  I told her that the
skin should grow back in a few weeks.

Andrew,  Attached is the CSA.  I added some language in the HP-hour Charge 
section concerning the minimums.  I wasn't able to download the spreadsheet 
into the doc.  I think it needs to be formatted into word and my assistant is 
not here today.  We can just print out the excel file and attach for now.  
Let me know if you have any questions.

Did you ever receive these documents?  If so, I need the originals.

David,  Could you please review the following agreement.  Specifically 
Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.  ReUse will be providing ash handling 
services under this agreement.  This same agreement will be used for both  
Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.  These are the power 
plants in the Alamac transaction.  We are looking at replacing the existing 
Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Have a good weekend!

Hi Dena,  Hope you had a good weekend.  I went to Austin for my friends 
wedding.  Got to see a lot of old friends that I haven't seen in a while, so 
that was cool.  Sounds like your pretty busy these days.  I can understand 
that with the transition moving forward.  Lunch would be great.  I am open

Gerald,

Jim Coffey and I met with Brian Redmond Thursday, March 1st to discuss 
20/20.  He has asked us to not spend any more time on this transaction and to 
concentrate on the sale of Houston Pipe Line until instructed otherwise or 
given further guidance related to 20/20.  During that meeting he left a 
message with Mark Witt and spoke with Brian Bierbach to discuss that the 
accounting support for the 20/20 transaction would soon not be as available.  
I am attaching a file where I have detailed out the issues as they related to 
Karry's spreadsheet for the detail of revenue and cost of sales 
transactions.  Below are the issues at a high level:

- The reversal of the June estimate.  ENA wrote off the receivable related to 
this.  Northern Border should include this amount in the calculation.  
Approximate value is $417,000.

- The O&M invoices with a date prior to July, 2000.  These are mostly Hanover 
invoices which Northern Border believes should be excluded.  The Hanover    
invoices were in the contract as included.  Approximate value is $527,000.

- The capital expenditure invoices with a date prior to July, 2000.  
Approximate value is $1,500,000.

Nick,  Attached is the form of services agreement.  The form is a little 
different than Steve Van Hooser's original form.  This a form that we used in 
Wyoming which I modified to fit this context.  I will prepare the tasking 
letter based on your scope of work and forward shortly.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.  

Attached is the form of fee simple purchase agreement that we will use for 
the reciprocating compressor sites.  Please forward to all appropriate land 
personnel. If you have any questions please call me at your convenience.

  

How is your day going?  Generally manageable around here.  One of the 
assistants found out I used to be an Iron Maiden fan (technically, I still 
am)  and brought me an old Iron Maiden poster.  Boy is that going to look 
good in the house.  I know this is really impressing you.    

Talk at ya later,
G$

Attached is the tasking letter based on the scope of work you provided.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.

The change if fine.  We also need to add the completion date for the services 
in  Part I Section 3.  I left it blank since I did not have that information.

I made one minor change.

Attached are the Professional Services Agreement and the associated Tasking 
Letter.  Please review.

  

I went to the floor with the intention of checking this guy out, but when I 
got there I felt stupid and didn't really feel the need to pursue that.  I am 
actually sorry I mentioned it to you.  Insensitive on my part.  It is not a 
huge concern to me at this point.

How is your day going?  Have you gone out of your way to talk to Cynthia yet?

Staci,  Attached is the CSA with my comments redlined.  Please review and 
let's discuss.

I would include language which also obligates Calpine to take assignment of 
the Precedent Agreement with Kern and any associated firm transport contracts 
and to meet Kern's credit requirements in doing so.  I would propose the 
following in addition to the Guarantee language;

Calpine agrees to satisfy any requirements of Kern River and execute any and 
all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate, as of the 
Obviously there is still the risk that if Calpine doesn't close or meet Kern 
River's credit requirements, then ENA is still left holding this contract.  
If you have any question, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.

Here's the PSA language.  Sorry.

(a)   Buyer agrees to obtain the release of Seller under Seller's guarantee, 
dated [_____], in favor of Kern River Gas Transmission Company effective as 
of the Closing, and in furtherance thereof, agrees that Buyer shall either 
provide its own guarantee in favor of Kern River Gas Transmission Company or 
such other form of security as shall be acceptable to Kern River Gas 
Transmission Company in order to obtain such release.

	Ron Coker
	03/07/2001 07:16 PM
		 
Below is the covenant we have in the PSA regarding release of the gas credit 
support.  When will a shipper be required to put up the credit support?  
Would anticipate we would have trouble obtaining a written release from Kern 
if Calpine agreed to provide the required support?  Would we receive a 
written release if Enron puts up a guarantee (which by definition covers the 
entire 15-year term) and Calpine puts up a three year evegreen LC?  Thanks.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Sounds good.  I let Eric know.  He's not sure if he will make it, but oh 
well, I gave him the invite.

Just to let you know...

The Happy Hour has been changed to Little Woodrows.  They think it might

want them to be hanging out at the West Alabama Ice House and we never show
up!

Attached are the following forms:

1.  Pipeline ROW
2.  Compressor Site Lease (for Screws)
3.  Compressor Site Purchase (for Recips)

I am distributing these for the sake of completeness. You may have already

Ann,  I have received your comments to the Enfolio and will review them.  
Have you received the confirms for the Transaction and executed yet?

Stephanie,  I made on small change.

Also attached is the Assignment agreement for Kern River.

It is going fine so far!  We'll see about the rest of the day.  Eric and I 
tried a new burger place for lunch.  I was bad and had a cheeseburger con 
fries.  Now I am struggling to even stay awake.  Nap. Nap.  Any idea on your 
ETA at Woodrow's this evening?

Two words about my after work activities.  Proper Pumpitude!!  I have to work 
that cheeseburger off.  Why don't I call you on your cell when I get showered

there.  Sound good?

Boy, you timed that pretty good.  Just walked back in about 10 minutes ago.

I am thinking that I will be here at least until 7 pm.  I will then run home
and walk Sophie and probably be able to either come by your place or just
meet you at Little Woodrows by 8:00.  How does that work for your schedule?
What are you planning on doing after work!

That Cheeseburger sounds good.  I had a cold Grilled Ham and Cheese.  They
ordered it before I left for my appt and then it had ben sitting here for
about an hour before I got ot eat.  Yum Yum Kitty!

Dear Mr. (X) President:

I recently saw a bumper sticker that said, "Thank me, I voted for
Clinton-Gore."  So, I sat down and reflected on that and I am sending my
"Thank you" for what you have done, specifically:

1. Thank you for introducing us to Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica
Lewinsky, Dolly Kyle Browning, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick.  Did

I leave anyone out?

2. Thank you for teaching my 8 year old about oral sex.  I had really
planned
to wait until he was about 10 or so to discuss it with him, but now he knows

more about it than I did as a senior in high school.

3. Thank you for showing us that sexual harassment in the work place
(especially the White House) and on the job is OK, and all you have to know
is what the meaning of  "IS" is.  It really is great to know that certain
 sexual acts are not sex and one person may have sex while the other one
involved does NOT have sex.  It's so unfortunate to see that the National
Organization of Women (NOW) has lost all credibility for  supporting you
throughout your escapades.

4. Thank you for reintroducing the concept of impeachment to a new
generation
and demonstrating that the ridiculous plot of the movie "Wag The Dog" could
be plausible after all.

5. Thanks for making Jimmy Carter look competent, Gerald Ford look graceful,

Richard Nixon look honest, Lyndon Johnson look truthful, and John Kennedy
look moral.

6. Thank you for the 72  witnesses testifying before the House and Senate
who
have pled the 5th Amendment and 17 witnesses who have fled the country to
avoid testifying about Democrat campaign fund raising.

7. Thank you for the 19 charges, 8 convictions, and 4 imprisonment's for the

Whitewater "mess" and the 55 criminal charges and 32 criminal convictions
(so far) in the other "Clinton" scandals.  No wonder it took you the entire
day of your last day in office to pardon them all.

8. Thanks also for reducing our military by half, "gutting" much of our
foreign policy, and flying all over the world on "vacations" carefully
disguised as necessary trips.  Please give my regards to Hillary, when/if
 you see her.  Tell her I'm working on a "Thank You" letter for her also.

9. Thank you, also, for "finding" millions of dollars of excess tax money. I

really didn't need it in the first place and I can't think of a more well
deserving group of recipients for my hard-earned dollars than jet fuel and
security for all of your globetrotting. I understand you; the family, and
your cronies have logged in more time aboard Air Force One than any other
administration.

10. Thank you for closing so many millions of acres of 'public'  lands
 without the input of the people and governing officials living in  the
states affected.

11.  Thank you for pardoning some 140 citizens who have been  convicted of
breaking the law, some of whom gave you hundreds of thousands of dollars to
your political campaigns.

12. Thank you for an attorney general that saw fit to protect you and your
'constituents' from embarrassment or prosecution.

God bless America and THANK YOU for redefining the integrity and character
of the highest office in the land.

Sincerely,
U.S. Citizen

P.S. Please pass along a special thank you to Al Gore for "inventing' the
Internet and making the distribution of this letter possible.

Attached is the information of Barbara's friend. Happy hunting.  I give you a 
call later about Satellite.

Attached are the revised drafts. 

Please note the following:

1.  I revised the FERC language but haven't yet talked to Drew about this 
concept.  He is in Houston somewhere and I have a call in to him.

2.  The Equivalent HP concept was removed.  Thus a Force Majeure or Utility 
interruption event will interuppt the Compression Services Charge.

3.  Please review the unwind language carefully in the Conversion Agreement.

4.  I added an arbitration provision.  This is standard in ENA or affiliate 
contracts.

The O&M form will follow shortly.

FYI,  Seems like the number is getting bigger and there may still be more 
numbers out there.  Let's discuss.

The post closing adjustment would actually be increased by $680k (Northern 
Border would owe ENA more)!

Karen Gruesen
03/08/2001 06:16 PM
I spoke with Karry regarding the outstanding issues related to 20/20.   He 
said that the items that were on item B on my issues schedule for Natural Gas 
Revenues for $989k were ENA paying Northern Border.  The $309k in item F were 
Northern Border paying ENA.  This would change the post closing adjustment by 
a net of about $680k.  I will work through the new calculation with the items 
identified.

Also, he said that he thought ENA's Gas accounting group, Scott Sitter and 
someone from Denver should meet to go through the adjustments and payments 
that have gone through since the closing.  This could affect the post closing 
calculation with fairly significant dollars and would be information that I 
would not have.  

Cris - I am attaching a schedule that I believe Karry used to get to the 
basis for the initial gain calculation.  It is on the tab "P&S Combined".

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Karen

Brant,  Attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised Credit Services 
Agreement with Bridgeline.  I made significant revisions to this document.  
In general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide 
a more detailed deal arrangement.  Please review  and if credit is OK, I am 
fine to send this to Bridgeline.  

Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.  The 
agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the 
services.  Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform 
the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee?  
Need to establish this before we send out to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Jean,  FYI, I have faxed the executed CA back to Entergy concerning Highland 
Energy.  They should be good to move forward with discussion.  Let me know if 
you need anything else.

  

I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to 
join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump.  
First of all,  you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the 
chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the 
market) and now you already discussing new ventures.  Secondly, Monkey Pump 
is not a stepping stone.  We are big time and those has beens "Quiet Riot" 
will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.  

I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the 
Music: Monkey Pump episode.  

"Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first 
album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really 
sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on 
reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago.  When we return on behind the 
music............"

Eric and I will discuss this and get back with you.  In the meantime we had 
better not see you at any photo ops with Poison or Warrant.

Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is 
rough.    

Some issues to note:

1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving 
assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they 
thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would, 
but it is a risk.

2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport 
agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release 
at max rate.  

3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more 
substance though.

Lets discuss.

=09=09=20
California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20

Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is 
rough.    

Some issues to note:

1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving 
assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they 
thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would, 
but it is a risk.

2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport 
agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release 
at max rate.  

3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more 
substance though.

Lets discuss.

Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company 
that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).  This 
might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your 
voice mail to Steve.

The company is Design Technics Corp.  Phone: (713) 460-2291.  The map will 
generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro 
level. 

Mary,  Attached is the list.  Let me know if you run into any problems.

Attached are a clean and redline version of the Gallup CSA and Conversion 
Agreement for your review.

Tyrell,  I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of  the letter 
agreement and your cover letter.  Please review.  As I noted earlier, Barry 
indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark 
to market.  I have not been able to contact him yet.  So unless Mark and 
Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry.

Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, 
Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form.  I have sent them 
an earlier version and I am copying them here.  

I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available 
after that.  

I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm 
transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done 
via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff.  I noticed that 
one of the packages is less than 1 year in term.  This means it could also be 
bid up in excess of max rate.  Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max 
rate.    We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is 
assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have 
no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.   
Probably need to discuss this with Mark.

Brant,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the revised agreement per 
our discussion

Yes,  I am alive.  Got in a little late, but still here nonetheless.  Deblah 
who?

I am checking to see if anybody is up for tonight and I should know later 
this afternoon.  I know we really need to have more drinks, its been so long.

Yes, I was serious about China.  Talked to Eric this morning and they would 
leave on June 6 and return on June 16.  I need to make sure this works with 
my work schedule.  I think it would be really cool to see Bejing, the Great 
Wall, etc............... and hone my skills as Show Lin High Priest Martial 
Arts badass......

	bswaldrop@aol.com
	03/16/2001 10:04 AM
		 
Hey there!

Just wanted to see if you got to work okay!  Guess who was up in our studios
this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jenn
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be so
much fun.  Now you're sitting there saying, "crap, why did I bring that
up...I was just kidding around!"

John,  Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.  The 
following items of note were revised.

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.  
Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to 
ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the 
transport, I am not sure why this matters.

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their 
tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the 
ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest 
language in the guaranty was removed.  

Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues 
with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

1.  Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with 
producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.  Producers were required 
to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will 
assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit 
on the capacity.  Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA 
capacity stake on this expansion.  The basis is currently very profitable 
between Wyoming and California.  Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt

2.  Enron Compression Services - StageCoach  - Negotiating a deal to provide 
HP Compression Services to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in Pennsylvania.  
Drafts have been sent to Tennessee.  Also negotiating a power and gas deal 
with EES to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to 
EES which ECS receives from Tennessee.

Andrew,  Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS 
and its accompany Transaction Agreement.  I think it does make sense to have 
a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power 
and gas sides.  Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.  I will contact Bo 
and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.   Please review the attached 
documents and let me know before you send this to EES.  As you will see I 
have a few question noted on the TA.

How is it going?  I didn't get here until about 9:20.  Yikes.  I had 6 
voicemail messages, when I got here.  Help.

Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach 
transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the 
information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would 
actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier 
discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think 
about this.

It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for 
the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks.

Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement 
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline 
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good 
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed as 
this is no longer part of the deal.

Ken,  I am forwarding the initialed cover letter with the changes included.  
Please revise the body of the proposal to also reflect the changes made to 
the cover sheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Also, I am getting ready to go into the studio and do another commercial.  I

???????  
??????? As we discussed, outlined below is a sentence that Transco proposes 
to insert to replace the language stricken by Enron at the end of Paragraph 2 
of the Guaranty to address Enron's concerns about over-collecting interest 
for late payments:

??????? "If Guarantor fails to make timely payment of the amount of the 
Payment Demand, then Counterparty shall be entitled to collect the amount of 
the Payment Demand together with interest calculated in accordance with 
Section 7(c) of the General Terms and Conditions of Counterparty's FERC Gas 
Tariff as amended from time-to-time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Counterparty shall not be entitled to collect such interest, to the extent 
such interest has already been assessed due to Company's failure to pay any 
Obligations which are the subject of the Payment Demand.

??????? Please call me at (713) 215-2810 to discuss Transco's revised 
language.? We look forward to finalizing the Guaranty today if possible.? 
Thanks for your cooperation.? Gnny Levenback

Some thoughts that might help from time to time.  This was forwarded to me, 
and I found it very compelling.

Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one 
so 
that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful 
for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often 
times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has 

been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a 
porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it 
was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what 

we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've 

been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an 
assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait 

for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in 
yours. 
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, 
and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't 
go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. 
Go 
for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark 

day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. There are moments 

in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from 
your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where 
you 
want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one 
chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to 

make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you 
human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. 
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The 
happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just 
make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for 
those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have 
tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have 
touched 
their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a 
tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you 
can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and 
heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was 
smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling 
and everyone around you is crying. Please send this message to those people 
who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or 

another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that 
make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those 
who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship. And if 
you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss 
out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message. 

Just wanted to pass this on to you.  It was great to see you again the other 
day.  Take care.

Congratulations!!  

On behalf of all of the Asset Group I would like to extend our appreciation 
and congratulations for making Hanover Measurement Services (HMS) a reality.  
A year of creative effort and determination, has transformed the project from 
the sale/leaseback of HPL's metering equipment into a viable measurement 
services company.    HMS provides the opportunity to reduce HPL's operating 
costs and leverage Enron's technical expertise to provide measurement 
services to third party customers.   

This project is an example of how the Asset Group must leverage our resources 
and existing assets to create sustainable, recurring earnings in the years 
ahead.  Each of you contributed to this success and your efforts are greatly 
appreciated by HPL and senior Enron management.  Our task now is to expand  
HMS' customer base and position the company to take advantage of emerging 
measurement, communications and systems technology.

Again, congratulations on establishing and financing HMS, and please share 
our appreciation with team members who assisted you in this success.

Regards,
Brian

Linda,  Arthur Anderson is conducted an audit of the subject entity and needs 
to obtain sign off from ENA Counsel that there is no pending litigation 
against this entity.  ECS Compression Company, LLC is owned approximately 10% 
by Enron Compression Services Company, which is 100% owned by ENA.  Attached 
is the form letter they want us to provide.  Can you review any issues with 
this LLC and have Richard Sanders sign off on this letter?  The letter needs 
to go to Jennifer Staton, who can be contacted at the cc email address.  Let 
me know if you need my help or have any questions.  Thanks.

Attached for review is a draft of the Gallup O&M Agreement.

Heather,  Attached is the ash handling agreement with revisions.  Please 
review.   I will be forwarding the coal handling agreement shortly.  The 
changes should be similar.

Redline of this document will follow.

Attached is the redline of the Ash Agreement.

Heather,  Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the 
Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.  I made a few further changes to the 
Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.  Please review and let me 
know if you have any questions.  Both docs do have a few questions inserted 
where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.  Sorry for 
the delay.

Thanks for the review.  A more formal response is not necessary at this 
time.

Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed
as this is no longer part of the deal.

Jordan,  Attached is the latest structure.  This is still subject to change 
as AA has not yet approved.  The deal basically involves creating a new 
entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and 
associated contracts which ECT currently owns.  The compressor motor drivers 
are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority 
(NTUA).  ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in 
exchange for $$ and MMBtus.  

Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.  This is a 
2nd Quarter deal.  Would you expect anything less?  Please let me know who 
will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions.  
Thanks.

Here it is G.

Attached are a clean and redline version of the revised docs.  Please review 
and let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a little early, 
so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a good time on 
Friday night?  How is everything going?

It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights last week 
to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of the new car 
with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points on Friday 
and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of him 
since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

 Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his are
flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians (sp?), a
place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get there at
about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head to the
downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends of mine
from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as well.  Are
you game?

 Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell: 281-687-6893.
I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

 Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting
into
 Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281)
772-9250.
 If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't
you just
 call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll
ride
 over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing
with me.
 My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
wedding is
 at 7.

 Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

Hotel Room Confirmation

 Gerald,

 Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129
rate.
 Below
 you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
matters
 which
 one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
They're both
 on
 my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

 I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from
SA.  I
 estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
right?)
 We'll
 actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family
from the
 Valley will be there as well.

 If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at
the
 hotel
 sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding
together
 from
 there.

 In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got
him a
 gift
 yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

How was the big weekend in Vegas?  I usually don't have to much luck at 
gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.  Did you win any money on the 
fight?  I had a blast the last time I went.  We stayed at the Paris hotel.  
Very nice.  All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did 
get a little tiring though.

Stephanie,  Attached is the form for the Hunt to Misako assignment.

Attached is clean and redlined version of the Misako letter agreement with 
revisions.  Please review and if ok have Misako execute.  

Please see attached.  I added an agreement by Hunt to assign their PA to 
Misako.

Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on 
your credit worksheet.  I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a 
different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we 
would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.  

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

I'll be there at 7:00.  Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be 
late.  Around 8:00.  She likely just meet us for drinks.  Is that a problem?

Travis for 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.  One catch...if everyone is not there
by 7:15 p.m. then they will yank our reservation because they have live
music and need the tables or something sketchy like that.  Anyway, see you
tomorrow...oh I included a reservation for Barbara so let me know if she
can't make it.

Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation

Hey there-
Ryan has not been feeling well all weekend and still isn't...so
unfortunately we were thinking of moving the dinner to this Thursday.  I
really hope that still works for you guys.  I don't think Ryan knows you
guys are coming, but had indicated a while ago how fun it would be to have
dinner with everyone...so I was still going to try and keep it a surprise.
Please let me know if that's still okay so I can change the reservation.

Thanks.

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above 
referenced counterparty.  The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation 
Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were 
forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999,  
Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and 
informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..  Further, she 
informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is 
free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because 
the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is 
subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another 
would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of 
Section 7.

Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions. 

Thanks.

Ginny,  Please see the attached guaranty.  A clean and redlined version are 
attached.  I revised the language based on our discussions and added the 
language concerning interest which we had both previously approved.  We are 
OK to execute this form.  Let me know if acceptable and I will go ahead and 
execute.  Thanks.

What's going on dude? Antigua was awesome. I survived it without a problem.
Heather moving in has been a different story. I didn't realize how much
"stuff" you could pack into a one bedroom apartment. How is your love life.
The gal from the wedding was pretty hot. Are you still chasing that? Lets
get together soon. Our extra bedroom is nicer now. My old bed got tossed in
a dumpster. It smelled like shit.

Talk to you later

Barry,  Attached is a draft of the confirm for the Sierra Deal.  This confirm 
reflect only the volumes related to Package Two.  The confirm for package one 
would be indentical to this one with term and volumes revised.  As we 
discussed this confirm, does not reflect the revisions needed to the existing 
master.  Please review and let's discuss.

Debra,  Darren Should be sending you two credit tickets for these entities.  
I will prepare the confirms for the Nevada Power Co. Master.   Thanks.

Gerald, I have discussed the papering of this transaction with SPPC and NPC 
and we will proceed with the raising of a Master Firm agreement between ENA 
and each of these co's. 

This specific sale will be papered under Nevada Power Co. so let's proceed 
with that paper being the lead.

I will review the confirm you sent, but re-issue under the premise that the 
confirm is being raised to the new master. 

Thanks.  BT 

Barry,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement for both Sierra Pacific and 
Nevada.  If you are OK with these, we can foward to them for their review.  
As soon you provide any comments on the Transaction Agreement, I can finalize 
them under the Nevada Power master agreement.

The information was sent to the FPSC staff on Tuesday, March 27, 2000.  Tom
did review the document prior to it being sent to the FPSC.  Gulf added a
small paragraph regarding the outages experienced on our 230kV system.  We
do not have access to AEC's information.  Thus, far we have seen no filings
from AEC or WFEC.

We can go ahead and prepare the termination letter, but it looks like Cheryl 
has some issues to flush out before we officialy terminate that tower lease.

Hello, Cheryl

I would like to better understand the issues before we make any decisions.
Can you please provide us with the details of this issue.  What is the call
sign of the HPL Licenses that we are talking about?  What type of equipment
are we talking about? (i.e. MW,  MAS, and/or Conventional Radio)  What
personnel or group is the equipment supporting?  What are the full list of
compliance issues on this?

Ryan Terry is with an external firm providing services to AEP and Enron in
assisting in filing of the necessary "Transfer of Control" Documents with
the FCC.   Depending on what the issues are Ryan and his firm may provide
counsel concerning this matter, but the decision to remedy these issues
and/or to cancel the license and remove the equipment will need to be made
by AEP, Enron and HPL personnel.

Bests Regards,
Jason D. Griffith

Hello, Ryan.  I got your e-mail address from Kevin Dumas.  I want to
discuss with you an issue we have at a tower lease site.  HPL is currently
leasing tower space from REB Communications in Gilmer, Texas.  Our
operator, HMS, discovered this week that the tower was not in compliance
with FCC regulations.  The most critical issue is that the tower lights do
not appear to be functional.  HMS has recommended that HPL remove it's
equipment from the tower and  cancel our FCC license immediately.

I would like to protect the interests of both HPL and AEP, and I would
appreciate your suggestion on what to do with the equipment licence.  I do
not want to do anything to jeopardize the closing of the HPL sale.  Please
call me at 713.853.6250, or e-mail me at cheryl.marshall@enron.com, so we
can discuss this issue.

	Cheryl Marshall

I spoke with Jason Griffith with AEP this evening, and I want to clarify my 
previous e-mail message.  The operation/business issues that we have at the 
Gilmer tower are under control.  The tower has problems with its lighting 
system, and it does not have its FAA license posted.  As lessee, HPL did not 
want to be exposed to the potential fines that the FAA/FCC could levy against 
the tower owner.  

This tower supports one person, and is not a part of our critical data path.  
My concern and reason for sending the prior e-mail revolved around the FCC 
licenses associated with the HPL owned equipment on this tower.  My knowledge 
about FCC licenses is minimal, and I wanted to ensure that removing the 
equipment from this tower would not jeopardize the transfer of the licences 
from Enron to AEP.  It is my understanding that the current operational 
situation at the Gilmer tower will not effect the transfer of the licences 
that are specific to this tower.  Please let me know if this is not the 
case.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Marshall

How bout them Horns? Give me a call when you get a chance.

Barry,  Attached are both confirms for the Nevada Power master with the 
changes we discussed yesterday.  Please review and if acceptable, please 
forward Nevada Power.

I am also re-attaching the Masters for both Sierra and Nevada.  No changes 
were made to the masters.

Have you guys received any information from Gulf Power concerning regular 
updates on the construction?  Jeff indicated that Gulf would be willing to 
provide updates monthly.  If we haven't heard from Gulf, we need to push them 
to provide this info.

Please see the attached.    John,  I think the only other issue was inserting 
the reference to Paragraph 6 in both Paragraphs 8 and 9.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Per your notes.

Barbara, The attached doc. contains a comparison of Houston Law Firm pay for 
associates.  This chart has the base salary only without any bonuses 
included.  I pulled this from FindLaw.com.  Let me know if you have any 
questions or want to discuss.

Eggcellent!!!  Yes, I did have your watch.  However, due to lean times on the 
Nemec ranch, I was forced to see what the cash equivalent of your watch would 
be.  Does $10 sound fair.  Anyway I took the ten bucks, which thankfully 
acounted for both my beers last night.   Chalk up another one to the Nemec 
leisure activity fund.

The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged a highly secret
plan they had funded with the U.S. auto makers for the past five-years. The
NTSB covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing
black boxes in four wheel drive pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in
fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.

They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of
drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, "Oh, Sh*t!" Only the state of Texas 
was
different, where 89.3% of the final words were, "Hey Y'all, watch this!"

Jenn,  Here is Jeff and Cathy's flight info.  Mine and Babs are the same 
except for the first legs to Tokyo.  We go from Houston to Minneapolis to the 
city the Godzilla destroyed.  I.e. Tokyo.  Then we catch the same flights 
from Tokyo to Shanghai.  We have the same return flights.

Attached are the contracts for the Kennedy and Quantum excess gas purchase.  
The confirms will be signed by the parties and governed by the GTC.  The 
attached GTC is the same for both confirms.  Note the Exhibit A to each 
confirm is not attached.  I will simply take the well listing Exhibit's from 
the existing long term contracts to create these new exhibits.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We lightened the tone significantly.  Let's discuss.

Please replace the prior version with these.  I added some Wyoming Royalty 
Statute language in both confirms.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Ken,  I have read through the agreement.  I think this agreement need some 
fairly significant revisions.  It is extremely one-sided as currently 
written.  I will write up my comments and get those to you early next week.

Gerald,

Have you had a chance to look at the Compressor Rental Agreement for the
Badger Wash Gas Plant?

Ken Krisa

Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from 
CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my 
review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type 
service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your 
attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being 
served from Transmission Service.  

1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal 
to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.  
Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what 
facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.

2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even 
if there was no usage of power by Customer.

If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward 
these  to you for signature. 

Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss.

Barry,  Attached is the form of assignment that we can use for assignment of 
all the Transportation Agreement to ENA.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Please hold these until Barbara Gray has reviewed the limitation of liability 
language  Thanks.

Darren,  Per our discussion, attached are the confirms for the Nevada Power 
transaction for the Firm GTC in lieu of the master.  After review, lets 
discuss the credit provisions we need to insert into the GTC.

Barry,  Attached is the GTC form without any revisions for any credit 
language.  Darren will be getting back with me shortly on the credit issues.

Julie is checking with Kern and the modification to their assignment 
agreement and whether they will prepare the assignments.  If I am to prepare 
the assignments I will need the Transportation Service Agreement information 
(volume, contract #, contract date)  for each shipper.

Linda,  I have reviewed the form of Master Construction Agreement and have 
approved its use in this project.  Please let me know if you have any further 
questions.

Per your voice mail.

Julie,  The attached spreadsheet contains all the parties and volumes, but I 
am still missing some contract numbers.  The Denver office is trying to round 
up that info.  Kern probably has all the contract numbers and could fill 
those in. 

The attached schedule has all the contract numbers.  Let me know if you have

Mom & Dad,

First off, what day do you guys fly out to Shanghai?  Is it the 5th or the 
6th? (i.e. send me your flight info!)

Attached is Jenn and I's flight itinerary for the China Trip (see forwarded 
msg below).  Gerald & Barbara, Dan, Gayle & Heather are also on the same 
flight going over.  We changed from the original Shanghai round-trip plan to 
save some money and avoided some logistic issues.....we are now flying into 
Shanghai a little earlier and leaving from Beijing instead of 
Shanghai............this allows us to avoid any domestic airline flights (a 
good thing) as that can be expensive and makes the trip a little less hectic 
in the beginning...so here's the tentative plan:

June 4th - Depart for China
June 5th - Arrive in Shanghai (Jon can you meet us in Shanghai on this day?)
June 6 & 7 sightseeing in Shanghai, June 7th Evening - take night train to 
Chingdao (if there is one)
 - Meet up with Rodger & Sandy, et al., either in Shanghai or in Chingdao.
June 8th - Depart/Arrive in Chingdao
June 9th - Wedding Bliss & related activities.
June 10th - Sightseeing in Chingdao
June 11th - Depart for Beijing on Train 
 (tentative departure date, we may want to stay around/see stuff in the 
area/or something else on the way there, etc.?)
June 12th - June 15th: Beijing (Sightseeing, day trips, etc.)
June 16th - Depart from Beijing to Houston (Eric & Jenn, Gerald & Barbara.)  
 Dan, Gayle & Heather are staying for another week in China, and I believe my 
parents are staying another 3 or 4 days as well?

Jeff and Cathy are possibly going to switch their flight as well in order to 
do this schedule.  This is of course a tentative/rough draft itinerary, & 
nothing is set but our plane tickets.  

Jon & Dan: I believe we are all looking to you guys to help us determine 
exactly what we should look at and more importantly what we should and should 
not eat.

Tiger penis soup anyone?!.........Looking forward to it,

Hey kids:

Greetings from Wuxi. The wedding preparations continue as planned. Just got 
back from another planning mission to Qingdao last weekend. We put deposits 
down on hotel rooms, restaurant and finalized the plans with the local 
Christian church. We were lucky to obtain the services of a very courteous, 
English speaking pastor named Mr. Dong. Mr. Dong will translate the ceremony 
into our native tongue for all big noses present.

I'm writing to you now to get your hotel reservations for your stay in 
Qingdao. We've put down a 2000 yuan deposit, but we must now secure exact 
lodging dates. Would you all please respond asap with the dates that you'll 
be staying in Qingdao? Everyone will stay at the Qingdao Dong Hai "East 
Ocean" Hotel. Most of you will probably be arriving in Qingdao on June 7th. 
The wedding is on the morning of the 9th. Do people want to stay an extra day 
after the wedding, or do they want to leave on the 10th after the wedding? 
Give me your plans and I'll fax them to the hotel management this week.

The big banquet dinner will not be immediately after the wedding ceremony. We 
couldn't find a suitable restaurant that wasn't already booked. We've moved 
the big wedding feast from noon to the evening of the wedding day. It will be 
at a famous Shandong style seafood restaurant. This restaurant has 
everything: snakes, frogs, scorpions, caterpillars, exotic marine birds, 
about 15 kinds of shellfish, and just about everything else you could imagine 
putting in your mouth that comes from the ocean, plus some things that you 
wouldn't normally imagine putting in your mouth from the ocean. It's kind of 
like going to Sea World and then pointing to a fish in the tank and telling 
someone how you'd like it cooked, except you'll be surrounded by a billion 
drunken Chinese tourists who will all be swilling ridiculous amounts of rice 
liquor and screaming, "Down with American Imperialism!" and "The East is Red- 
Long Live Chairman Mao!" Sounds great, eh?

So- please, tell me your planned arrival and departure dates to and from 
Qingdao so we can finish this monkey business with the hotel folks. Hope all 
is swell with everyone. I'll be in touch again soon. Adios.

Cheers,

Jon Gillaspie

Notes:

Ma & Pa- please get this info from the Staters and the Aines.

Eric- pass this on to Jennifer so we can get this info from Dan and Gail Junk.

Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter 
amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those 
obligations and liabilities.  

	Tyrell Harrison@ENRON
	04/12/2001 04:49 PM
		
I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side 
agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to 
our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the 
pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward 
immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that 
Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

Attached is the amendment letter, the Spread Value Calc. doc, and the 
indemnity letter for Patina.

The agreements look ok.  We discussed earlier the issue of whether or not the 
Lakeland agreement needed an out for filing with the Florida Public Service 
Commission or whether this filing was already made.  If I remeber correctly, 
you were going to check on that.  Did you have a chance to find anything out?

Pls take one last look at these agreements just to make sure they are ready 
to go. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Daddy-o:

If you want I can recommend some hotels we stay in. If you're traveling with 
Dan and Gayle you probably won't be searching out the cheap, flea-bag, opium 
stalls that I frequent. Shanghai has oodles of hotels. If you browse through 
a China "Lonely Planet" travel book you'll see a breakdown of the various 
hotels based on prices and accommodations. If you're pinching pennies we can 
get you decent rooms at a new hotel for about 400 yuan ($50 USD), but the 
joint is no where near the Bund (waterfront). Shanghai ain't cheap.

Ai Ping will most likely be in Qingdao doing wedding preparations when you 
arrive in Shanghai. I don't know exactly what my work schedule will be like, 
but I'll be there to meet you. In regards to the Shanghai>Qingdao flight, 
we'll try and book for everybody. I don't think we'll need your credit card 
info. I'm hoping we can arrange for all of you to just pay in the airport 
when you get there (ie. we'll reserve it).

The itinerary below looks fine. I'd take the morning flight to Qingdao on 
June 8th. That way you can get settled in your rooms, hit the beaches, stroll 
the streets, drink fresh Qingdao beer, and familiarize yourselves with the 
city. June 9th is the big day.

June 10th you can hang out for another day in this coastal city, or move 
north to Beijing. I'd say spend the extra day in Qingdao and relax a little 
bit before entering the tourist madness that is Beijing in June. You'll need 
a day to rest after the wedding because you'll be expected to consume about 
three vats of rice liquor at the wedding banquet eating extravaganza. I shit 
you not- this will get ugly. You'll be expected to go native and vomit on 
your wife. I'm fuggin serious! Every fat-assed, 60-something, sausage-eating, 
big-nosed, camera-toting Western devil ever born in the history of the planet 
will accompany you on your trip through the Forbidden City in Beijing. Bring 
lots of benevolence and Buddha-like patience or bring lots of heavy weaponry.

The only pre-wedding activities will be a group dinner somewhere and a night 
at my French buddy's pub on June 8th. We'll probably eat at a shithole 
reataurant downtown that serves the wickedest squid bbq in the Eastern 
hemisphere. You won't be expected to assist in any way other than making 
yourself extremely groovy. We could also arrange a group boat ride on the 
ocean to a couple surrounding islands. Qingdao itself translates into "Green 
Island." But, as you know, it's not an island, it's just surrounded by 
several.

Yep, I'm now nearing freak out mode. In a way I've just got to do what I do 
best: be a stupid foreigner and stay out of the Shang family's way. It's Ai 
Ping's wedding in Ai Ping's motherland- I'm just here to be me and play the 
role of the goofy Western monkey who marries the Chinese princess. Please 
god, mail me some dope.

Write again soon. Looking forward to the chaos....

Hugs and booty-smooches all around,

Jon

Texas Utilities Fuel (k#012-88968-02-001) is trying to hold HPL responsible 
for imbalances incurred after October 1998, but according to the contract 
brief Texas Utilities Fuel  was assigned to ENA.  No one in contracts can 
find the assignment paperwork.  They don't know if it was misplaced or never 
done, and the counterparty was not informed of the assignment.  For our

whomever in legal type up the paperwork.  Let me know what you need from me,

Attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the Compressor 
Motors, NTUA Contract, and TW Contracts to ECS LLC.  I know we still don't 
have structure approval, but I can begin working on the documentation for 
those items that will not likely change (the transfer of assets and 
contracts).

Please review and let me know of any issues or problems.

 I called the travel agent . . . left a message for some goon
there to call me back.  As soon as he calls me back I will put down a
deposit for myself & Gerald (my new roommate) . . . tell me something
about this guy: J Arthur said he met him previously and was cool with
him.  'Sup?

 Hot Shirley Slack has had a death in the family and is out now
on an "extended" leave of absence.  FYI.

Brant,  We need to ask PCS Nitrogen if they are a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Potash.  If they are not, then Canadian law may prohibit them from providing 
a guaranty for a less than wholly owned entity.  

I will provide you my comments to the documents shortly after lunch.

Any update on that PCS guaranty review?  Exposures are pushing past $20MM, a 
highly visible exposure.

Ken,  Attached is your letter with my revisions.  I took out the arbitration 
adder.  Decided it probably made more sense to give us the right to go to 
court immediately if we needed to.

6. Right to Compete.  This agreement neither obligates any Party to deal 
exclusively with any other Party hereto nor prevents any Party or any parent, 
affiliate, subsidiary or related entity or person of such Party from 
competing with any other Party or any parent, affiliate, subsidiary or 
related entity of such other Party, so long as such Party remains in 
compliance with this agreement.

regarding the enclosed.

Very truly yours,

Attached is the maintenance agreement with my revisions.  Please review

Hi Mom,  Hope everything is going well.  Sorry to hear about the relatives.  
I am doing fine.  Staying busy with work.  

I am scheduling a trip to China in June.  My friend Eric's has a brother who 
lives in China and is getting married to a Chinese national.  He invited me 
along, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to see a part of the 
world that I likely would not otherwise see.  We will be going from June 4  
through June 16.  Flying into the city of Shanghai and from there going to a 
smaller town called Qingdao.  The wedding will take place in Qingdao.  Should 
be interesting to experience a Chinese wedding.  We will then go to Beijing 
for sightseeing.  Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Great Wall etc.    Should 
be a great experience.  

My roommate will be moving out in a couple of weeks and is getting married 
May 5 in Des Moines, Iowa.  I will going up for the wedding.  Take care and 
talk to you later.

Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from 
CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my 
review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type 
service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your 
attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being 
served from Transmission Service.  

1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal 
to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.  
Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what 
facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.

2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even 
if there was no usage of power by Customer.

If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward 
these  to you for signature. 

Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss.

discussion with WIC and CMS.

Please review specifically the Confirm and Letter Agreement.  I will give 
these a once more over and we should be able to send to Greeley tomorrow.

AP--

               In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 
playing recruiting
               "catch-up", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state 
wide out
                                  
               Delmer Shanks

               As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the "Opossum" set 
of OU's
               daunting new offense. 
               "The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year", 
Shanks
               explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart.
               "In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up 
out with 2 or 3
               of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, 
and then the
               center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand 
off to either me
               or the quarterback.".
               When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the 
season,
               a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to 
say.
               "Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be 
sponsoring OU
               athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I 
really liked what
               they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring 
they're putting on
               everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also 
gonna do
               some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon 
pies and
               stuff at the door."
               Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools 
before his
               commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed
               interest in him all along.
               "Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to
               momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be 
the year
               they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with 
their high
               power pro-style attack".
               It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision 
some. A
               laughing Shanks explains,
               "Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come 
hollering
               outside...said Stoops promised her I would wear #8 at OU.
               We all been Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans for a long time, so we 
seen the
               importance of what they was saying. They don't honor you like 
that OU
               unless they done taken a real liking to you."
               As the interview came to a close, Shanks had this to say,
               "Keep an eye on us, cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next 
year.
               We got 11 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna 
go out on
               pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the 
quarterback.
               Boomer Sooner."
               Only time will tell if schools like Texas, Nebraska and others 
can keep up
               with Stoops and his amazing program.

Tyrell,  Attached is the letter amendment revised to reflect payment of 
Payment Two on Jan. 4, 2002 as well.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Yo Pa:

They're just whining. It means nothing. I'm glad Bush Jr. didn't sell the
Aegis boats to Taiwan yet; if he had the Butchers of Beijing would have
raised a big stink. The common people read the newspapers, drink their tea,
and complain a little, but they won't raise the topic with a foreigner they
don't know personally. Remember- Sun Tze wrote the "Art of War" 2500 years
ago. We're doing exactly what the Chinese would do if they were able to, and
they understand this.

If the PLA weren't so stupid and belligerent a majority of the Taiwanese
would probably agree to a slowly enacted "One Country-Two Systems"
arrangement like Hong Kong and Macau. Unfortunately, the PLA adds 50 missles
every year on the Fujian coast aimed at Taiwan, and ceaselessly threatens
the Taiwanese. Also, the continued antagonism between the Kuomingtang (Chang
Kai Shek's KMT) and the commies doesn't help. Taiwan's economy is developed
and robust, a "little dragon" of East Asia; while the mainland still has 900
million peasants wiping their asses with leaves. If you were Taiwan would
you be racing to re-join the motherland? Jiang Ze Min promised the
hardliners in 1993 when he was coming to power that he would bring Taiwan
back in to the fold. This isn't going to happen during his tenure. He's
finished in 2003, and he's bummed that the glory of a unified China won't be
ascribed to him. Sorry, chum.

This won't affect the wedding or the Chinese people's reaction to your
presence in the motherland. This is a wedding, and everything should be back
to normal by June. None of my Chinese colleagues flip me shit about it. If
they raise the topic I just say I don't formulate American foreign policy.
If they have any questions or comments they can direct them to Colin Powell.
I'm a common bloke just like them and they understand. As they say in
Alabama, "It's all gooood."

Yesterday Ai Ping and I finally reserved all the hotel rooms for everybody
in Qingdao. I've got you booked from June 8-10: three nights. You'll be on
the 29th floor in the presidential suite- you've got 170 square meters and a
great view of the ocean. The room consists of a huge living room, two
bedrooms, a kitchenette and a bathroom. I'll be living with you on June 8th,
and then move to another room on the wedding night. Eric and Jeff will be on
the same floor. This hotel was built for the PLA brass in the late 1970's,
but now caters to corporate clients who want to live and work in the same
building.

Check your plane tickets to make sure when you're arriving in Shanghai. Is
it June 5th or 6th? If you leave Minneapolis on the 5th, you'll probably be
arriving in Shanghai on the 6th. Let me know. Ai Ping's heading back to
Taiyuan tonight for some final prep work in Shanxi. Later she'll be
returning to Qingdao one more time to make final arrangements. I'm swamped
with UK, US and Australian visa prep work. Right now is crunch time for me.
The weather here is great. Should be nice and steambath-like by the time you
arrive in June. Enjoy! Dress accordingly. No wool suits! We are six weeks
and counting..... Let the chaos begin. The weak shall be punished.

Hope all is swell in Iowa. I'll be in touch again soon. Give my favorite
schnauzer a big,juicy smooch on his black nose. Zaijian.

Love, Jon

Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter 
agreement:

1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and 
reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and 
Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The 
"Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures" only are the method by which this 
is effected.  This change needs to be removed.

2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 
1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK.  
Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct 
terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting 
the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already 
agreed.

3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be 
stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create 
a firm purchase deal with this letter. 

4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from "that quantity of Gas..... 
to.......... (the "Released Gas"" should be removed.  The term Released Gas 
is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in 
this letter.   I am OK with ENA "hereby" agreeing to waive any and all rights 
it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA 
"may" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to 
recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.     

If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with 
Phillips, I would be happy to do so.

Paul,  Attached are the Greeley Docs.  They include:

Stephanie,  I would suggest modifying Section 9.4 as follows:

9.4  Addendum 1, attached to this Agreement, the bid procedures under which 
the transportation capacity hereunder was obtained, is hereby incorporated by 
reference as part of this Agreement, solely for informational purposes only.

Chris,  Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and 
Enron South America.  Please review and forward any comments you have.   
There is an existing Confid. Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 
21, 2002.  The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.     

Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain 
provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under 
Chilean law?  We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.

Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions.

FYI  Attached is the draft gas agreement I had forwarded to EES earlier.  I 
did not receive a response.

Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach 
transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the 
information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would 
actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier 
discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think 
about this.

It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for 
the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks.

Attached is the assignment.

Attached are the latest drafts (Clean and redlined).  There are still blanks 
to be filled in for the numbers.  Please review.  The only question they 
(Foti) had on the O&M Agreement, was what the minimum yearly number would be.

Ann,  Sorry for not getting back to you on this.  I have some answers on the 
issues that were on my to do list.  It might make the most sense for me to 
comment in response to your memo dated March 8, and forward to you.  I know 
there were several items that you were checking with your people and I would 
note those.  Let me know what you think.

Hello Gerald,

I just wanted to drop you a line to apologize for not getting the letter
response out to you.

Do you know if Russell contacted the Canadian office about issuing the
Canadian draft agreements for review and finalization with the U.S.
contracts?  I thought that was his intent, but we have received nothing as
yet.

Have a wonderful Easter holiday!

Clement,  Please review AEC's additions and let me know what you think.

Ann,  Attached is the memo AEC forward with ENA's responses redline.  Please

A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Bob.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Attached is the response.  Please review ASAP as they are trying to file 
today to meet the response deadlines.

Andrew, Gerald

Attached is the meeting notes from a 1 hour meeting we had with Cantera
Resources and Tom Brown on April 24.  We will be meeting with them again on
Monday, May 7 in Dallas.  This meeting will involve the president and
operations manager of Cantera as well.  While the last meeting was more of
introductions and high level "where we are"  and "what are the issues"
discusssion, this meeting will be more definitive where we plan to discuss
the pressure and curtailment issues in more detail, and we will be
discussing moving the Entrada from San Arroyo to our plant.  I am sure they
will also want to discuss some sort of agreement for us to move foreward
together on the low-Btu project.   Tom Brown representatives will be
involved via phone - as they must until the deal closes.  We told Cantera it
may be a very short meeting as there are certain things we won't talk about
in front of Tom Brown.

In our meeting on Monday - which will start at noon with lunch, I want to be
able to show them a couple of things.  I want to show them Graphs 2-2.1-A
and 2-2.1-B and Figure 2-2.2 out of section 3 of the Contract Issues book I
gave you.  I want to also show them Graphs 3-2.1-A and 3-2.1-B and Figures
3-1 out of section 4 of the book.   I was not planning on discussing the
monitary value associated with these graphs (the sum of these issues totals
just under $1MM economic harm to Crescendo as I calculated from June through
December 2000.)

Andrew, I will call you in the morning to discuss in more detail what we
should and should not show them or discuss concerning the issues.  I will be
on my cell phone at 915-349-8223 all morning.

Thanks,

Ken Krisa

Greg,  Attached is a redlined version  of the interconnect agreement with 
their comments incorporated.  I did make some revision to their comments,  
please review and if OK forward to Brazos Valley or their reps.  

Do we have any concerns from a credit standing concerning this LP.  I don't 
know the magnitude of cost on the HPL Facilities, but we need to make sure we 
don't get stuck with their cost.  Might want to ask for cash up front with a 
make whole once the facilities are completed.  I haven't made any changes to 
reflects.  Thoughts?

interconnect has no specific provisions for assignment to Pinnacle.

We have an executed Corporate Guarantee from Constellation for the work to be

guarantee is for $300K.  Constellation will be responsible for the costs even 
if the Interconnect is assigned, as is permitted by the Interconnect 
Agreement, to Pinnacle (PNG Utility).

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

process.  Pricing for various risk management products can be provided at the 
request of the customer.
  
 Customer will not be exposed to daily prices, even during OFO periods

 Seller can provide accounting services to handle all payables for 
transportation capacity and therefore provide a consolidated statement for 
gas supply and transportation.

Seller is prepared to work with the Buyer to manage any new acquisitions that 
take place during the course of any agreement.  However, Seller maintains the 
right to reprice the products and services provided under such agreement if 
such acquisition materially affects the scope of the original offer.

They selected a three year deal, however, termination language will need to 
be negotiated. We will wait for Mike Grigsby to get back to determine some of 
that language.  If they terminate with in one or two years, they will be 
required to pay the difference in the demand charge for the period we 
provided this service and the $.08.

Please let me know what else I can do to help facilitate this process.

The Northern Border guys would like to recognize their $500,000 in earnings 
associated with  the Kern Capacity that they syndicated in the 3rd Quarter 
and make it part of the Master Service Agreement between ENA and Crestone.  
This is the document that they proposed.  We should recognize some additional 
float given the lag in the payment date.  Gerald can you approve this from a 
legal standpoint?

Greg,  Attached is the form of guaranty to use for the Brazos Valley 
Project.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Kim,  I made a few tweaks to the letter.  Nothing substantial.  I still have 
a few questions noted and some dates that need to be filled in. Please review.

Majed,  Wanted to make sure you are still scheduled to start on May 21.  Let 
me know if anything has changed.  Thanks.

Gerald,

I hope everything is going well with respect to your work load! I know that
you are probably very busy with conference calls. Anyway, I look forward to
working in your department this summer. I have already taken my drug test,
and have given Molly Magee my start dates (tentatively with your approval).
I have my start date scheduled to commence on May 21, 2001 and end on June
29, 2001. I hope these dates coincide with your schedule. Please e-mail me
and let me know.

Looking Forward to this summer,

Majed Nachawati

Nabil,  Can you please provide the dates that you are planning on
working
for the 1st half of the summer. I called your residence earlier today,
but
your machine did not pick up.    It is probably easier to communicate
via
email since we both keep missing each other.  Thanks.

Mark,  Attached is the Howell Petroleum comments we discussed.  Please handle 
accordingly.

Joe Russo's numbers are (307) 332-3940
   (307) 850-4341 cell phone

Joe,  Mark Van Skoyk in our Denver office will be taking the lead on all Lost 
Creek ROW issues.

Thanks.

Joe

I have tried to call you several times but no luck.  I want to discuss the
proposed right of way.

With reference to consideration, Howell is not agreeable to 10% down.  We
expect 100%, further I believe we will require a minimum of $2,500
providing we agree on $12.00 per rod.

In the grant delete "communication line(s)".  Line 7 insert "pipeline"
before "communication equipment".  Further we need to delete any reference
to surface equipment other than markers, wireleads, vent pipes and
communication equipment.  If a gate plant, ground valve, pigging equipment
or cathodic protection equipment is to be located on Howell's property we
will need other agreements.  The systems Howell operated in Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida were contracted in this manner.

Paragraph 3 we need to address our current operations in the area and its
precedence.

Paragraph 4 replace normal plow depth with a "minimum of four (4) feet"

Paragraph 8 and 12 I think will not be approved by management and it would
make expediting the execution of this document easier.

Paragraph 9, Howell in no way will grant any Power of Attorney for
anything.  Any amendment will be executed by Howell.  Delete all references
to POA in entire agreement and Exhibits.  Further we prefer the entire
right of way be recorded not a memorandum.

Paragraph 16 after "Right-of-way Grant" insert except for the term
"pipeline".

Paragraph 17 delete any reference to Tenant in the entire agreement.  We
will secure execution by the Bank, you may deal with the tenants.

Further, I believe we will need an indemnification provision protecting
Howell from any operation performed pursuant to this grant.

Let's talk.  We will make a deal that all parties can live with.  Our
perspective is a little different than the average rancher.

We have two Summer Clerks coming in this summer which we have hired through 
the Houston Bar Association Minority Recruitment Program.   Majed Nachawati 
will be starting Monday May 21st.  He will be here 6 weeks and Alisha Mahibar 
will start on July 2 and be here the final 6 weeks.  

Enron Corp. also has hired two law summer clerks from UT .  These clerks will 
be doing 4 week rotations throughout Enron and we will have them each for a 
four week  period.  Dates are still being finalized.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the 
Global Market group this summer.

I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge 
of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan 
is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the 
groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would 
be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I 
will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.  Thanks for 
all your help.

Attached are my revisions to the Lost Creek Gathering Agreement for the Devon 
deal. Please review and let me know if you have any issues.

Kim,  I will forward two hard copy executables to you.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

 

Give Molly a call and check with her.  She may want you to report to her 
first.  Otherwise we'll see you on the 21st.

Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used 
for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement 
with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The

Marlene,  We need to ask the counterparty what type of liens they have on 
their gas and we would want to limit it to those types in the contract.  We 
need as specific a description as possible.  If you want me to talk to 
someone at the counterparty I would be glad to do so.  Need a name and phone 
number.  Thanks.

Marlene Hilliard
10/08/99 08:52 AM
On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above 
referenced counterparty.  The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation 
Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were 
forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999,  
Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and 
informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..  Further, she 
informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is 
free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because 
the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is 
subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another 
would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of 
Section 7.

Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions. 

Thanks.

Marlene D. Hilliard

Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current 
transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  
Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they 
would prefer to terminate or void this contract.

Dave,  Per Barry's request, attached is our firm GTC and confirm for gas 
purchase/sale.  The GTC is typically only for deal which are 6 months or 
less.  Credit also need to review the counterparty.  Depending on the 
circumstances, a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement may need to be put into 
place.  Let me know if you would like a copy of the master.

Jenn forwarded me this, thought you might Enjoy it?!

Greetings!  Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe.  Sitting at my desk trying
to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs.
Ruppert is kind of freaky too.  I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which
I've
become accustomed to in the last couple weeks.

Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing!  Everything I could have wanted
and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time.  The trip there was

quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all.  we got settled into

Athens around 4 p.m. Monday.  Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful

view of the Acropolis.  Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are
kind
of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling

me, I mean its a big city.  We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I

try to avoid large groups of formal tours).  We took a ferry to Santorini
and stayed there for 3 days.  Loved it!  We ate some faboulous restaurants
on cliffs overlooking the water.  Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables,
bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove

all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to
absorb the rays.  Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we
didn't bring swimsuits.  As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of
the
culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs.  Ryan surprisingly left
his
shorts on this time???  Loved the black beaches!  We tried to find a more
private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our
attempt.  We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing.
We
drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed
in rock with a few tavernas.  so we had dinner there and watched the
sunset.
  The most amazing seafood!  They took us in their kitchen to show us what
they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's
request being a geologist and all.  We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and
then
of course back down.  We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so
hot, I did not venture in the water.  After the ride we had to get all the
way back to the top so we took donkeys of course.  Quite an adventure as we

were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff!  Luckily
mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought).

We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so

we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great
people which we later went out with that night.  You all should have seen
Ryan at the discos!

Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini.
Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and
slept.  Loved this island a lot.  Not as touristy and the greeks were very
pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer.

All in all the wedding was fabulous.  I was very happy with the wedding
festivities too.  And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast.

The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the

night before.  I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal!
The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about
everything!  Its just so overwhelming.  One of the best parts was sitting
on
the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and
people's faces lighting up.  Knowing that all those people were there to
share in our special moment was just so wonderful.  Of course I wish I
could
have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you.  We were
so
honored you all traveled so far for us!

I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest
I've ever been!  Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.  I hope
you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves.  Everyone was
surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed
in
you gals!  Except for Falb she always pulls through with something!
Anyway,
love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well!

Forever Gams!

I'm thinking they were targeting you guys for some of these...Gerald, I
think numbers four (the official third stage of G), eight (picking fights
and pushing Eric and/or Ryan after drinking) and eleven (I'm so smart
because I work at Enron and you can't teach this you pauper, I need to pump
up my pomp) are for you. Jeff, numbers two (I'll go upstairs right now and
talk to my neighbors and ask them if I'm too loud), five & three (Sinatra
and shadow dancing) and thirteen (every time we go out) are yours. And
Eric, number ten is you. Although the rash would be caused by a mysterious,
moving ramp or stairs and the redness would occur on your ass, not your
forehead!

Due to increasing products liability litigation, American beer brewers
have accepted the FDA's suggestion that the following warning
labels be placed immediately on all beer containers:

1. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may leave you wondering what
the hell happened to your bra.

2. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you are
whispering when you are not.

3. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol is a major factor in dancing

5. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to think you
can sing.

6. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to believe that
ex-lovers are really dying for you to telephone them at four in
the morning.

7. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you can
logically converse with other members of the opposite sex without
spitting.

8. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you have
mystical Kung Fu powers, resulting in you getting your ass
kicked.

9. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to roll over in
the morning and see something really scary.

10. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol is the leading cause of
inexplicable rug burns on the forehead.

11. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may create the illusion that
you are tougher, smarter, faster and better looking than most
people.

12. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to believe you
are invisible.

13. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to think people
are laughing WITH you.

14. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause a disturbance in

Brudda,

I spoke with Jenn about accommodations in Beijing as well as Shanghai and
she said her dad is also getting some info from a local Chinese travel
agent.  How about dropping Dan a line and working with him to recommend &
book everyone's hotel.  His e-mail address is:  djunk_epc@yahoo.com

I believe part of the group is looking to Jon and the other part is looking
to Dan to make their accommodations for them. I hereby anoint the two of you
to make the lodging decisions for everyone else, as we are drooling cows
with no direction or relevant info.  Therefore, the two of you need to get
together and decide on a hotel (for Shanghai & Beijing), so we can all be
together and don't have to coordinate getting together everyday in freakin'
China (i.e. nightmare).  Jon maybe send an e-mail to Dan suggesting a few
hotels/price/level of accommodations/etc./your recommendation/ and then you
two make the call and book it for us.

I think the "core" group we should worry about getting
reservations/accommodations is as follows:
Shanghai: (arrival on the 5th, Jenn, Eric, Heather, Gayle, Dan, Gerald,
Barbara) 7 people-3 rooms for the night most likely (Jon you can crash in my
room)
Mom & Dad & aunt Jean and Kid arrive on the 6th (2 more room)
Jeff and Cathy arrive on the 7th (1 more room)
8th we all fly to Qing dao, hotel in Qing Dao is selected and booked
Beijing - Everyone listed above is traveling to Beijing as a group.

As far as getting rooms for the other people (Staters, Rassmussen's, etc),
that's your call, but we are operating without any real good info.  I'd say
they are on their own as we don't know when they get in, what their plans
are, etc?  If it's no big deal reserving rooms and not getting dinged if
noone shows up then maybe get a few extra rooms at certain places, I don't
know the Chinese hotel system, level of $$ exposure, hotel availability,
etc., its your call, I'd assume they can probably get a room no problem so
let's not try to coordinate more people than we have to, they can sleep on
my floor if they can't get a room in China....

This is what is called Wedding planning lotus bliss...

We are all looking forward to this...

Eric,

Thanks for the info. Will book flight for June 8th and find suitable lodging

in Shanghai. Do you want me to line up lodging in Beijing for you and the
rest of the entourage?

Let me know, and I'll finish this madness while I'm in Qingdao this weekend
with our friendly travel agent chum, Zang Bao Guo. Take care.

Chazow,

Jon, I'm attaching a memo sent to me by one of my
previous Enron people in China.  Lillian Li no longer
works for Enron and was not available to help us in
Beijing (she got married and will be moving in June).
Anyway, she has this travel agency friend who has
recommended stuff for Shanghai and Beijing.  It's all
spelled out in the attachment.  For 3 days in
Shanghai, for ($285 per person for 3 days and
nights),$90 USD a day per person which includes hotel,
meals, transportation, tickets, etc. sounds
reasonable.  What do you think?  I do like the sight
seeing she recommended.

Then, in Beijing for 7 nights in a good hotel,
sightseeing, transportation, tickets, tour guide, etc.
for ($525 per person for 6 days and nights), $88 per
day per person didn't sound bad either.  Here in
Beijing I like the sightseeing she recommends.  Again,
what do you think?

What she failed to tell me was the cost of the airline
ticket from Shanghai to Qingdao to Beijing.  Could you
check on that for us?

If there is a better way to skin this cat (no pun
intended, just that all these Nancy boys are afraid of
the chinese food and all) please advise.

Congrats,look forward to seeing and hearing from you.....Dan

a cover letter for my review and our discussion.  Thank you.
Steve -HPL- Schneider
10/12/99 06:43 AM
As per our conversation yesterday, I have a heightened concern about the CPS 
Interconnect Agreement as drafted, as it implies that HPL can perform at 
certain levels based on the facilities being installed.  This is incorrect in 
probably all cases, and I need your assistance in drafting a cover letter to 
help clarify HPL's position to CPS as to our ability to perform, and more so, 
our contractual obligation to perform relative to this proposed contract 
draft.  All this contract does is agree that HPL will allow the facilities 
they are requesting to be installed, subject to Tejas Gas' approval (JV 
responsibility), at their cost.  There is no commitment to flow any volume of 
gas on any basis under this agreement.  Any such obligation would have to be 
negotiated and agreed to in writing separately.  Please provide draft 
response.  If you have any questions, please call.

Let me address your topics one by one:

 1. That is fine, except that no guaranties regarding the condition of your 
entertainment center can be made for the duration of your stay.  What day are 
you planning on moving?
 2.  I have only received one piece of mail within the last week, so I think 
it is mostly working.
 3.  Eric's local  - Egillaspie@coral-energy.com  (713) 230-3576
 4.  No calls
 5.  Sounds good.  Sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up, we both have 
been running somewhere when we ran into each other at the house.  Sat. nite I 
think the Gillaspie's wanted to go to Sambuca's downtown.  Thought I might 
join them.  Might want to check with Eric to see what's up.  

Peace,  G$

Gerald,

The dust is finally starting to settle here at work and at Laura's, allow
me to address a couple of topics:

     1)  I plan to be fully moved out this weekend except that I'd like to
leave me entertainment rack in your garage for a week or two while I try to
sell it if that's OK with you.
     2)  I put in a forward for my mail but is doesn't seem to be in
effect.  I called in a complaint yesterday but until then you may continue
to receive some.  I'll just have to check every couple of days.
     3)  I still haven't caught up with Eric at all, do you have his new
work number and email?
     4)  I don't know if you're getting any calls for me but in case you
don't have it, my new number at Laura's is 527-9460.
     5)  Lastly, we need to knock back some tonsil paint this weekend
sometime.  That will give me a chance to turn my key back over to you as
well and you can go back to walking around the house naked.

That's about it.  Talk to ya later,
Ryan

today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity 
of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility 
this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss.

The importance of all long term plans to build a comfortable life faded away 
into cloud of apathy and listfulness.  No cares anymore.  Just extract as 
much as possible from each experience never knowing where it might take you.  
Wow.  Such thought before used to scare the hell out of you.  But isn't it 
ironic to finally find out no matter how much you try to control each aspect 
of your existence, it could end up somewhere completely unforeseeable 
anyway.  You have no control.  No control.  So why try to control it.  Why 
not open yourself up to all those unknowns, those risks, those potential 
great failures.

You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did 
you?  In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.  I 
will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.  Any chance I could get you to 
drop buy every couple of days and pick up my newspaper and mail and put them 
inside?  Would appreciate it.  

I pay her $50 per visit and she comes every two weeks.  Not a bad deal.

A little of the sauce got in the way of some of my moving plans this
weekend.  I should be out this week sometime, though.

What do you pay that cleaning lady per month?  Not having to do laundry
anymore all most makes it worth it, huh?  We might have to look into that.

Dan:

Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet? It would be
impossible. Anyway, here's a quick update from the battlefield. In regards
to flight plans, we had a minor setback today. We called our local Wuxi
travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix. I asked her

if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports. After
much heated debate she said no. However, we then called Shanghai Pudong
Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry. They demanded
that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports.
Therefore, I'll need for you to provide me with the full names (first,
middle, last) for everybody in your group. We'll then pass these on to the
Wuxi agent who has already lined up the Shanghai>Qingdao flight. We'll also
provide the full names to agents who'll be setting up the other flights.

Secondly, let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey.

After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing.

We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao, Zang Bao Guo, to line us
up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote. Jeff felt that the

$525/person fee was too much; he stated that he had retirement savings to
consider (ha!). We've spent the last couple days in negotiations with
another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the
same Beijing tour package at a more budget-minded price. Today she gave us a

rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package. The
estimated price would be about $520/couple for the same five day package in
Beijing. This is in comparison to your price quite of $525/person for a five

day package. We would downgrade from a 5 star hotel to a 4 star hotel (it's
new). Keep in mind that we're still hammering out the details, but the
alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the
wallet.

The crude itinerary would look something like this:

June 11- fly to Beijing in the morning; check into hotel; tour the Forbidden

City; see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening.

June 12- Great Wall; Ding Temple (tombs); Beijing roast duck dinner.

June 13- Temple of Heaven; Summer Palace; dinner at the Old Beijing Tea
House (singing and other entertainment provided).

June 14- Tiananmen Square; Beihai Park; lunch at Beihai King's Food
Restaurant (this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during

the Qing Dynasty); Yong He Gong (Tibetan temple); free evening.

June 15- Hutong alley tour; lunch at a Xinjiang (Chinese Muslim cuisine)
restaurant; Wangfujing Street (shopping at the trendy stores); Beijing opera

in the evening.

June 16- most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai.

We knocked out some destinations from the original plan. For example, the
dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang (antique shopping). Ai Ping

called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldn't be very
interesting: it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we
see on TV every night. The dance performance didn't include any minority
group dances or "traditional" village styles, so Ai Ping didn't think it
sounded very "Chinese." If the antique shopping is desired (it's an
on-the-street auction, with other stores selling original and
not-so-original "fake" items) we can slap it back on the itinerary. I don't
give a hoot either way. I aim to please and we are extremely flexible. Ai
Ping's hometown is six hours west of Beijing. She's been to Beijing a
billion times; she doesn't care where we go. Let me know what you think and
we'll do as instructed.

Thirdly, I don't think we'll be needing any deposit money. The airplane tix
will be reserved in your names. The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to
have your Shanghai>Qingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that
you could pay there. The Qingdao>Beijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon

arrival. The Beijing agent hasn't mentioned a  deposit for the tour package
yet. If she does, I'll put the money down- no problem.

So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do

the Shanghai tour package: your call. It looks like a good plan to me. If
you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it.
Let me know.

Hope this gives you an idea on where we're at. Please respond asap with
comments/questions. Hope all is swell in Tejas. Will write again soon.

My Regards,

Jon Gillaspie

Ken,  Attached is the Northwest Pipeline FA with my comments incorporated. I 
have attached both a clean and a redlined version.  Please note that I added 
a cap to the total facilities costs.  This is a recommendation.  To the 
extent we have no cap however,  Crescendo is at risk for all costs they 
incur.  Cost overruns could be significant.  Please review and let me know if 
you have any questions.

Barry,  I added a some language to th disclaimer.

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should  forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you  emailed.? I had a Spanish
speaking attorney in our office assist me  with their review.? The bylaws
look fine. We would like you to follow  up with a certified copy in the
mail.?? For now can you confirm  via a response to this email, that these
are the latest bylaws on  file?

?He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be  required that two
of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of  attorney documentation,
execute our agreements.? Can you  confirm?? Would be happy to discuss this
with you.

Thank you  for your cooperation.

We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the 
Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you 
have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please 
send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday 
session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 
hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by 
Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various 
state bar organizations. 

If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the 
Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the 
appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

Kim,  Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.  The documents are 
revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.  I changed 
the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their 
concerns about a non commodity agreement.  I have also added language 
requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.  Instead of a legal 
opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas 
Services and Transaction Agreements.  In included a redline of the services 
agreement from the prior version.  The Transaction Agreement would not 
redline on MS word for some reason.  I will request my assistant to redline 
it for you on Monday using comparewrite.  If you need help prior to my 
return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.  Please forward these documents to 
the City if you are okay with them.   Thanks.

Rae,  Please redline the No4 against the original No3 on compare write and 
forward via email to Kim Ward.  MS word would not redline correctly.

OK Kids:

This will be one of your last major briefings before your Mars landing. Good

luck cosmonauts! Remember one thing: the Martians are a little weird from
our standpoint, but essentially they are harmless and good-natured bipeds
like us. Now, let's begin with the pre-landing meeting.

ERIC/DAN'S GROUP:

Shanghai hotel: Jin Chang Hotel.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan).

Heather's single room rate: $27 USD/night.

Tour package price: $34 USD total/person (280 yuan) this price is for June
5-8.

Meals: Meals not included in package. Your group will need to arrange and
pay for your own meals with the assistance of your guide/translator. Your
translator will accompany you to the restaurants if you wish. He/she can
help you order and suggest dishes which represent the local Shanghai
cuisine. Go ahead and pay for your guide's meal if you choose to bring them
along for dinner (it won't be very expensive). This option will give you
more freedom.

Admission tickets: Also not included in the tour package. You'll need to pay

for admission to the Yu Yuan Gardens, Yu Fo Si (Buddhist Temple), Shanghai
Art Museum, etc.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at Pudong Airport in

Shanghai. Ai Ping and I will accompany them and meet you. They'll also take
you and the rest of the group to the airport on June 8th for your flight to
Qingdao.

We got a special hotel rate for the group through one of Ai Ping's friends,
Lucy Hong. Her company, Rosemont Corp. (Dallas, TX), has a special
arrangement with the hotel. When you check in you should tell the clerks
that you're checkin in under the Rosemont Corp's name so as to receive the
special discount. Don't worry- we'll be there to assist you when you check
in.

MOM/DAD'S GROUP:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan), same as above.

Tour package price: $24 USD total/person, reduced price because one day less

in Shanghai.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at the airport and
take you to the airport for your Qingdao flight on June 8th.]

Note: you also need to check-in under the Rosemont Corp. name.

JEFF/CATHY:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: same as above.

No tour package.

Airport service: none. You'll need to take a taxi into Shanghai from Pudong
Airport. You could also take a bus, but I'm not sure which of the 4-5 buses
you would need to take. Jeff, I'll have Ai Ping try and send you the Hotel
name and address in Chinese so you can just show it to the taxi driver. I'm
not sure whether or not your computer will accept Chinese script, but we'll
give it a try. The Jin Chang Hotel is relatively new, so most of the taxi
drivers don't know where it is without a little assistance. Not to worry,
we'll figure something out to make sure you don't end up in Chengdu after
your trans-Pacific hop.

You'll join the rest of the group the following morning on the hotel bus to
the airport for your Qingdao flight.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS FOR THE VARIOUS HOTELS YOU'LL
BE STAYING IN:

SHANGHAI: Jin Chang Hotel
Telephone: 021-6298 8899

QINGDAO: Donghai Hotel
Telephone: 053-2388 7070

BEIJING: Beijing International Hotel
Telephone: 010-6512 6688

When you call these numbers you should say in perfect Mandarin, "Qian tai."
This means "front desk." Then start blabbing in your most unintelligible
English. The hotel staff will then understand that they've got a foreign
devil on the line making trouble, and they'll find someone who can speak
Chinglish with you.

Ai Ping and Jon Gillaspie's mobile phone number: 013033511842.
We got Ai Ping's cell phone hooked up again specifically to assist all
parties in their entrance to the middle kingdom. Do not hesitate to call us
any any time of the day if you need help. I'm serious!

Ai Ping's beeper number: 1922202866. You can use this number also.

BEIJING TOUR PACKAGE DETAILS:

Hotel name: Beijing International Hotel, 5 star hotel.

Hotel price: $70 USD/night (570 yuan).

Total package price: $550 USD/couple total.
This price does not include beverages (ie. in restaurants we buy the booze).

We'll also need to pay for the roast Beijing duck dinner, and the Xinjiang
restaurant dinner (Chinese Muslim cuisine).

Tour package itinerary: same as before with some minor changes; will inform
group of changes tomorrow.

That's all for now folks. I'm spent, and can no longer look at a computer
monitor without becoming cross-eyed. More info will be sent tomorrow. Any
questions: you know who to contact. Zaijian comrades, may the proletarian
revolution continue!

The East is Red,

Jon Gillaspie

Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion.

Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted 
projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement

Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information 
available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as 
you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  
If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be 
used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would 
need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide 
these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are 
fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic 
idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal 
support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.

Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage 
arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I 
makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as 
this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage 
company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use 
the counterparties paper.

GT,   Big game this week!  I heard ESPN Gameday is even going to be in 
Austin.  Sounds pretty cool.  OK if I crash at your place again?  I am 
planning on coming in early Saturday morning right now.

Eric:

Am in the process of arranging your Shanghai leg of the journey. Will set up

a package that allows you to choose meals. I think you should have a little
guidance in your explorations of the Shanghai area. Shanghai is a friggin
mad-house (16 million people) and if you ain't got the language skills
they will bend you over a rickshaw and ride you like a poodle. So- let me
set up your hotel and sightseeing for you. You can break loose from the
"tour group" vibe later in Qingdao. Keep in mind that you'll be in a
relatively small group (ie. it won't be a Greyhound bus packed full of
gawking blue-hairs). I'll send full Shanghai details when the biz is
finished later today...

In regards to the Beijing leg, we altered the itinerary to suit our needs.
We knocked out the bullshit and kept the bliss nuggets. You should have a
traditional Beijing roast duck dinner (it rocks!) and you should experience
Beijing Opera at least once in your life. We'll see the Beijing Opera in a
famous Beijing teahouse while sucking tea and brews and nibbling on pickled
chicken feet and other assorted delicacies. We knocked out the full two-hour

Beijing Opera performance that would have been later in the week. We'll be
staying in a Wangfujing hotel. Wangfujing is the trendy shopping street in
downtown Beijing; should make the wives happy. It'll be $70 USD/night.

Will send full Beijing details when we've finished the haggling and cheating

rituals that make life so wonderful in the middle kingdom.

Take care, guyeee.

Love,

Jon

and you sit with me. More beer money for you.

Attached is a clean and redline version of the revised agreement.  Dan has 
not had a chance to review all the new language, but in the interest of time, 
I am sending this out for review.

I know he's not actually planning to crack the seal on that book and to 
sponge off us, so I have been feeding him bad information all week.  I can't 
wait until Kristi asks, "What could happen if you don't properly equalize?"

What time is the tailgate kicking off?  I am still driving in on Saturday 
morning.  Not sure if I have any 70s stuff, but I will take a look.  Need a 
tie dye.  

Gerald,

If you have any 70's clothes bring it. The tailgate has a 70's theme and
will have a dj and everything. It's going to be a blast. Are you still
coming in on Saturday?

George T.

I feel your pain brother.  I only about halfway through Section 1.   I 
haven't picked up the book in a while.  I will have to catch up on Sunday 
because I will be in Austin on Saturday watching the Horns crushed the angry

Mr. Nemec,

Did you receive the latest WIC supplement dated 10/12/99 ??
I read it and didn't have any problems with it. It gives us VOLUMETRIC firm 
rights at 80% of the max. recourse rate on the excess ramp up volumes.

Let me know.

Mike

Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know 
if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this 
issue:

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.

 

Can you please pull the referenced contract and lets discuss.

Gerald,

Due to some changes in our business, we are needing to amend the current 
transportation contracts for HPL transporting on HPL.  We will need to amend 
the current 012-41500-02-003 contract, covering the transportation cost from 
a particular wellhead all the way to Houston Ship Channel, to become two 
contracts, one we call the "gathering agreement" (covering transportation 
cost from the wellhead to a competitive supply curve like Thompsonville zone 
or Agua Dulce zone) and then another agreement we call "marketing 
transportatin agreement" (covering transportation cost from the competitive 
supply curve to Houston Ship Channel).

We need these amendments to be effective as soon as possible since we are 
targeting making the administrative changes effective during November 
production month.  I tried to call you but was not able to be connected to 
your voice mail.

I would like to sit down with you in the next couple of days to discuss this 
change and what we need to do to have the agreements changed and the new 
gathering agreement put into place.  Please respond via email or call at 
3-1836 to discuss this issue further.  Thanks!

Interconnect 4th sen        Do we really want to change a definition?  Or did 
we accidentally define this twice?

Operations  second sen    NO-  It is HPLC that will be nominating the gas, so 
why would we try to balance with a nom that they are not making as the 
PURCHASER.  The buy/sell agreement should handle the volume in the attachment 
of a confirm that will go out as the deals are negotiated over a short term 
basis.

Item iv  instead of inserting continuous, we should say "analyzed monthly"  
because we will already have a proportional to flow sampler on it.

Finally, I am not happy with the language on the term.....I do not think that 
we should now name a term, otherwise, termination whould go with the new 
contract sent out.

Well, call if you get a chance to conference!  713-851-3815  cell

Hello fellow Rice Alums (and other generous benefactors)!

Gerald, (its Sunday and this is what I have)

Davis is going to make some changes that he and Courtney discussed yesterday 
in addition to some more equipment and project details.  He will likely do 
that tonight 
at home so we will send an updated draft in the moring.  

Defining the LLC stuff to them is not going to happen and will be removed 
from this 
document before packaging for Eastman.  

The Force Majuere and other sections are going to be difficult to sell to 
Eastman and
we are going to need to work on that portion tomorrow.

Have a great day.

GT,  I won't be able to come in for the game this weekend.  I am taking a 
scuba diving class and I have open water dives on both Saturday and Sunday.  
I am kinda pissed off at myself that I didn't realize this when I signed up 
for the class but now I am committed.  I will still sell the tickets to your 
brother and nephew if they want them though.  I can FEDEX the tickets to you 
by Friday or worst case, just have the ticket office leave passes for the 
seats at will call.  Let me know.

G,

  

G,

How's it going? Are you ready for some football? The tailgate is going to be
another wild one. Hey, my brother and nephew are coming into town. Do you
want to sell your tickets for a c-note and sit with me again? Also, what day
are you coming in? Let me know.

GT

I will FEDEX the tickets.   Party hard for me.  G,  You need to come to 
Houston when you get a chance and well have a good time.  

Gerald,

Dude, what are you thinking about? Just kidding. I hope we kick their ass.
Listen.. send me the tickets overnight to 10300 hwy 290 east. Manor I.S.D.
annex office George Townsend Manor TX 78653. My bro will pay you 50 for each
again. Sorry you can't make it.

We are getting a chartered bus for the Big XII Championship so get tickets
and come to Austin. Have you been chasing any women lately? Pick a good
weekend and I'll come to Houston to watch or video.

Mark,  The attached document outlines the relevant documents to be assigned 
to the new LLC and their assignment provisions.  Please note that for the 
City of Farmington Power Supply Agreement (Bloomfield), a deposit will be 
required by the new assignee.  Please review and let me know if you have any 
questions.

Larry and Lance,  The contract packages which contain the referenced 
agreements will be sent today.

I again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been 
assessed.  The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, 
L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated 
rates.
The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub 
Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.  Since we 
are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and  
these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting 
upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive 
these rates in a competetive bidding situation.  It is my understanding the 
discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these 
discounts are at risk due to posting requirements. 

The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign.

Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the 
same as above.

I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell & 
Patterson (FERC Counsel) and he is to get back with me early this afternoon.  
I will let you know if anything changes.

Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes.  As we 
discussed, the letter is now non-binding.

me know if you have any questions.

GT,   Was that an ass kicking or what?   The game look like a blast on TV.  I 
am still pissed I missed it.  

Did you get the tickets okay?  Hope so.  How was the Tailgate?  Any sweet 
sweet babies?

I am officially a certified scuba diver!  All set for Cozumel in February.  
You can still get in on the trip if your interested.

How did Lisa take the Red Raider butt whipping?  Give her my condolences.

G,

The game was great but actually boring. I got the tickets and will mail you
a check for $100. We are organizing a trip to the Big XII Championship on
Dec. 4. I will give you details later. Did you pass your scuba class?

Three problems with this Draft.

1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to 
meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".  My 
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our 
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement 
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.

2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any 
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would 
be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely 
and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our 
in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in 
establishing such date.

3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication 
Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that 
this equipment will do the job we need it to.

I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their 
convenience.

Mark Courtney
11/29/99 04:37 PM
I think you should talk to their attorney directly.  Relevant points are:

1.  This is actually a 12 MW substation.  

3.  The communications are for their use only and don't really effect us 
except they might want to interrupt us when it is down.  That would of course 
be unacceptable.

I still have some outstanding questions for Texaco, all relating to Sorrento.

We need signed copies of the Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin PSC agreements and 
the BASF amendment dated 7/31/99 (there are some rate changes in this 
agreement).

In addition, I have the following questions:

* Is cavern #2 assumed start date of 7/01/2001 OK?
* Is cavern #2 assumed size of 3.2bcf OK?
* Are the following daily charges or monthly charges:
       $0.15 capacity reservation for LGS (Monthly)
       $0.1125 capacity reservation for Sabine Hub Svcs (Appears to be 
monthly,  Contract not clear)
       $0.1150 capacity reservation and $0.75 MDWQ reservation for both 
Wisconsin entities (Monthly)
* What is the currently calculated capacity reservation rate for Entergy?  
(Demand Charge of $2.42/MMBtu times the MDDQ (=100,000 MMBtu))  Adjusted in 
accordance with the FERC interest rate.)  This is a monthly charge.  This is 
the New Orleans Public Service Inc. contract info.  I believe this is the 
same as Entergy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,

Gerald,

Following is additional information about pressure differentials.  As I 
understand it, we are not contractually bound to deliver to Entex through 
MidCon if we can't get into MidCon.  Consequently, charging back third-party 
costs may not be an option?  Steve Schneider (who isn't around right now) is 
probably the best source for this information.  Nonetheless, this does not 
negate the fact that we might want compensation if over time one or both of 
these interconnects prove to be useless for a prolonged period of time due to 
pressure differentials.

Let me know what you and Eric find out.  In the meantime.

Johnnie
Jim Schwieger
11/23/99 06:18 AM
Steve / Johnnie:  As stated below in Brads "e" mail the range of 
deliverability we can expect on the MidCon Texas Interconnects is between a 
minimum of 75,000 MMBtu/d and the design maximum of 100,000 MMBtu/d.  I 
believe this answers the remaining questions.  We have provided what I 
believe to be overwhelming strategic as well as financial justification to 
building these interconnects.  Now its time to shift into approval and most 
importantly immediate construction.  With the construction of these 
interconnects I believe there is a high probability of getting a 5 year 
storage deal done this year.  This would greatly reduce HPL's Spread Risk. 
(which just in the last week has resulted in approximately $3 million in 
losses).  Please let me know why we can't receive approval and begin 
construction immediately.   Please let me know why we would not be able to 
have operational by January 1, 2000.                       

I have run some additional flow studies for the east side of town to 
determine HPL's ability to deliver gas to MidCon Texas at the proposed 
Flagstaff interconnect.  With gas leaving Bammel at a reduced pressure of 600 
psig, HPL will only be able to deliver 74 MMCFD at around 450 psig to MidCon 
Texas, assuming the combined Equistar/Destec Channelview delivery is only 60 
MMCFD.  Increasing the Bammel pressure to 650 psig will only increase the 
deliverability to 78 MMCFD.  Therefore, it would be safe to say that with 
pressures at Bammel ranging between 600-650 psig, HPL will only be able to 
deliver around 75 MMCFD to MidCon Texas.  One of the main reasons why the 
deliverability to MidCon Texas only increases by 4 MMCFD with a 50 psig 
increase in Bammel pressure is that the increased pressure backs off gas to 
Channelview from the 12" Baytown line.  With that gas backed off, more gas 
must be supplied from the Bammel direction, using up a portion of the 
additional capacity generated by the increase of 50 psig at Bammel.  Making 
the initial assumption that no gas will flow to Channelview from the 12" 
(3018) line will only further deteriorate HPL's ability to deliver gas to 
MidCon Texas.

Brian,  Thanks for the kind words in the phone mail message.  I enjoy working 
with you and your group and look forward to continuing to do so.  Thanks 
again.

Mark,  My comments

Following is one of the memos detailing some of the concerns about pressure 
differentials between HPL & MidCon.

Johnnie
Will Chen
11/19/99 08:47 AM
Johnnie, 
I have a attend the A/A mentoring program this morning and won't be back till 
11am. 
if you need me, page me, 800-608-9432.
I am forwarding you this email I got from Brad last night. 

I have run a flow study on the east side of HPL's Houston Loop to determine 
whether HPL can deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon during winter peak hour 
conditions.  The interconnect pressure will be around 600 psig, which will 
allow HPL to deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon with an 8" AAT-90 turbine meter.  
This is the full capacity of this particular 8" turbine meter.  The following 
assumptions were made in the preparation of this flow study:

1) The available gas pressure at Bammel is 900 psig.
2)  The Hardy Toll road mainline regulator is fully open, not taking any 
pressure cut.
3)  Entex being delivered gas at a peak hour rate, which is defined as HPL's 
historical peak Entex day plus 30%.
4)  The deliveries being made to both the Destec and Lyondell Channelview 
plants total no more than 60 MMCFD.

If capacity gets tight at Flagstaff, Gas Control can shut in the regulator 
from the Enerfin system to the 12" (3018) line to boost pressures.  Gas 
Control could also raise the pressure at Bammel to more closely track the 
MAOP of 936 psig on the east side of the Bammel loop.

Please note that if Bammel pressures are lower than 900 psig due to low 
inventory at Bammel, and Entex is on a peak hour delivery rate, then HPL will 
have difficulty making a 100 MMCFD delivery to MidCon Texas at Flagstaff.  
Increasing the turbine meter size to a 12" AAT-140 would solve this problem, 
but this would result in a greatly oversized measurement facility during 
normal operating periods.  A better solution would be to shut in the Enerfin 
and Maxey Road regulators to boost pressures on the east side and to attempt 
to limit Lyondell and Destec deliveries.

I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it 
operates, when it meets. etc.  Any information you could supply would be 
greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Gerald Nemec

                   BODY: 

                   Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one 
place. And 
                   he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at 
times, but 
                   the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, 
the 
                   giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, 
because 
                   this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the 
                   company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit 
called 
                   Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more 
than 
                   $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was 
Saturday 
                   afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying 
                   through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This 
was 
                   college football. This was Texas. 

                   On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the 
University of 
                   Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few 
minutes on 
                   the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the 
team's 
                   newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The 
Cornhuskers, 
                   perennial national title contenders, were big-bully 
conference 
                   rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young 
Longhorns 
                   were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under 
                   second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and 
generous alum 
                   (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 
'em 
                   Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director 
DeLoss 
                   Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown 
to 
                   Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on 
                   management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, 
                   financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private 
suites 
                   at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a 
                   charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous 
                   Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports 
programs. 
                   He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas 
                   Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns. 

                   So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the 
Nebraska 
                   game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and 
business 
                   associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the 
field 
                   at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange 
shirt and 
                   surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy 
an 
                   offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. "Hey," he 
yelled, 
                   "ain't this something?" 

                   It sure is. The University of Texas athletic program is at 
a 
                   pretty intriguing place in college sports. With a surging 
young 
                   football team at its core, it is one of the most 
successful 
                   college athletic programs in the country, and I'm not just 
                   talking about wins and losses. This is a 
multimillion-dollar 
                   enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a 
                   renegade campus outfit. College sports has been a 
big-ticket 
                   dance for some time now, and this program is much like 
others at 
                   the top-tier universities, but there are a couple of 
exceptions: 
                   The folks making the moves in Austin function more like 
CEOs than 
                   like traditional athletic directors and coaches, and 
they're 
                   making it work. 

                   To determine how they do it, I went back to school this 
fall and 
                   asked to take a close look at the books. What I found was 
an 
                   operation that balances the athletic department's 
educational 
                   responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the 
costs 
                   of running a big-time athletic program are surging and 
most 
                   college athletic programs are in the red. I found a place 
where 
                   football pays the bills. That was no surprise, but this 
was: 
                   Among the beneficiaries of big-time football is a women's 
sports 
                   program that could be a model for gender equity. 

                   In fact, at the University of Texas, the football 
Longhorns are 
                   Grade A cash cows. Athletics officials credit the team 
with 
                   generating a staggering 80% of the department's $ 45.3 
million 
                   from revenues in 1999. That's $ 36 million from tickets, 
                   individual donations, rights fees, sponsorships, hot dogs, 
beer, 
                   and other sources. 

                   The athletic department operates much like a 
self-contained 
                   corporation, separate and apart from the rest of the 
university. 
                   It has its core business (football); various auxiliary 
operations 
                   (other men's and women's teams); numerous revenue streams; 
                   traditional corporate functions such as finance, 
marketing, 
                   public relations, and HR (you know it as recruiting); and 
even 
                   sophisticated satellite offices--dozens of alumni chapters 
                   nationwide, through which athletics targets some 400,000 
Texas 
                   Exes for private gifts. Got shareholders? You bet. More 
than 
                   80,000 of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays 
in the 
                   fall, and they grade every move Mack Brown makes. Think 
chasing 
                   quarterly expectations is brutal? Try putting the success 
of your 
                   company in the hands of a bunch of 18- to 22-year-olds. 
Hate 
                   talking to analysts? Try answering Buck from Muleshoe, 
Texas, on 
                   a weekly call-in talk show after losing a 23-point lead in 
the 
                   fourth quarter. 

                   Of course, the whole thing is complicated by the fact that 
while 
                   a major-college athletic program must be managed with the 
                   diligence of a public company, athletic directors don't 
have the 
                   luxury of shutting down unprofitable businesses--at most 
schools 
                   that would be every sport save football and men's 
basketball. And 
                   those well-paid football coaches, quite simply, must win. 
"If we 
                   were a business, we wouldn't have any sport but football, 
and we 
                   would generate a heck of a profit," says Dodds, who is 
among the 
                   nation's most respected athletic directors. "But we're not 
about 
                   that. We take the money we generate from football and use 
it to 
                   provide opportunities for other kids. Then we try to 
balance what 
                   we want to accomplish inside the institution with what 
folks 
                   outside the institution want us to do. It's a hard thing 
to do." 

                   For more than a quarter-century, one of the most difficult 
                   challenges for college sports has been finding a place for 
women. 
                   You've probably heard of Title IX, the historic clause in 
the 
                   Education Amendments Act of 1972 that turned college 
sports on 
                   its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality 
for 
                   women in participation, scholarship allocation, 
recruitment 
                   spending, and coaching resources. The requirement forced 
athletic 
                   departments to essentially double their operations, which 
helped 
                   spark the overall growth in college sports. So whatever 
you think 
                   about the emphasis on college football, hey, it pays for 
women's 
                   soccer, okay? 

                   The Texas athletic department's budget is among the 
largest in 
                   the nation--$ 41.2 million for fiscal 1999, which ended in 
                   August. Only four universities had fatter sports wallets 
that 
                   year: Wisconsin ($ 41.4 million), Tennessee ($ 45 
million), 
                   Michigan ($ 47.6 million), and Ohio State, No. 1 by far 
with a 
                   whopping $ 64.9 million athletics budget. (If you think 
those who 
                   spend the most win, forget it: OSU is the only school of 
the 
                   group not ranked in the latest Top 25 AP football poll.) 

                   How does UT get to its number? For starters, ticket sales 
and 
                   game guarantees (payments to UT by a host school when the 
                   Longhorns play on the road) generated $ 10.1 million in 
revenue 
                   last year. That category was exceeded only by private 
gifts, 
                   which totaled an impressive $ 21 million. Other 
significant 
                   income categories included suite-lease revenue ($ 3.2 
million), 
                   television money ($ 3.9 million), payment for the team's 
Cotton 
                   Bowl appearance ($ 866,842), optional student fees ($ 
570,000), 
                   sponsorships and advertising ($ 400,000), licensing 
revenue 
                   ($ 300,000), and concessions ($ 750,000). All told, the 
department 
                   generated $ 45.4 million in 1999. 

                   The athletic department's expenses totaled $ 50.1 million. 
That 
                   included scholarships valued at $ 2.8 million for 226 men 
and 186 
                   women, administrative costs ($ 1.4 million) for about 230 
                   employees, and equipment purchases ($ 2.4 million). The 
costs of 
                   running individual teams ranged from $ 7.5 million for 
football to 
                   $ 370,000 for tennis. 

                   What caused the shortfall? The final bills for a two-year, 
$ 93 
                   million capital improvement effort. Remarkably, the 
athletic 
                   department completed the project without a penny from the 
                   university's academic funds. It raised more than $ 31 
million in 
                   private donations in just over two years. The department 
also 
                   took out $ 48 million in bonds (serviced now by lease and 
ticket 
                   revenues). The bill was closed with $ 14 million from the 
                   university's Parking and Traffic division to fund a 
parking 
                   garage. So what can you get for $ 93 million? Take a 
stroll down 
                   East Campus Drive near the stadium, and you'll pass the 
spiffy 
                   new $ 28 million Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field. 
One block 
                   over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the 
                   country, the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields ($ 2.5 
                   million). It was subsidized by 82-year-old World War II 
veteran 
                   Frank A. Denius, a longtime fan who has attended practices 
most 
                   every day for as long as anyone can remember. 

                   Beyond the 66 suites at Royal-Memorial stadium, UT added 
nearly 
                   7,000 new seats, renovated major sections on both sides of 
the 
                   76-year-old facility, and lowered the field three feet. 
Why lower 
                   the field, you ask? I did too. Better sightlines, of 
course. The 
                   stadium renovations cost $ 55 million--$ 3.2 million to 
lower the 
                   field alone! The department also spruced up its main 
offices, now 
                   known as the Moncrief-Neuhaus Complex. (If you've got an 
extra 
                   million, you can get your name slapped on just about 
anything.) 
                   The place is Four Seasons plush. There's an impressive 
academic 
                   support center stocked with computers, a hangar-sized 
weight room 
                   that could inspire a couch potato, and an over-the-top 
football 
                   locker room any NFL team would envy--custom-carved 
benches, 
                   original art, and lockers the size of small Manhattan 
apartments. 
                   Mack Brown's spacious office, with a picture window 
overlooking 
                   the stadium field, is trimmed in warm cherrywood and 
decorated 
                   with mementos and collectibles, including a case of 
watches 
                   commemorating universities and bowl games where he has 
coached 
                   during his 24-year career. Photos from the Longhorn 
archives line 
                   the hallways, and display cases in the lobby house the 
school's 
                   three national championship trophies (1963, '69, and '70) 
and the 
                   1977 Heisman Trophy, won by the man who is still the most 
                   powerful and exciting running back in college football 
history, 
                   former Longhorn Earl Campbell. Check out the intricate, 
                   hand-carved leather saddles in the cavernous players' 
lounge. 
                   Yep, you can sit on the saddles and watch games. 

                   If it all seems impossibly lavish, there are reasons. The 
stadium 
                   upgrade generates new revenue, and the school had to build 
new 
                   facilities for its women's programs under requirements 
outlined 
                   in Title IX. But perhaps the most vital reason is 
recruiting. "We 
                   had to stay sexy and attractive to the kids," says Ed 
Goble, UT's 
                   vice president of business affairs. "You've got to provide 
an 
                   enhanced experience on campus to compete for the best 
kids." 

                   CEO and COO would be more appropriate titles for Dodds and 
Brown, 
                   the UT athletic director and head football coach. Dodds, a 
                   62-year-old former track coach, got into sports 
administration 
                   because he liked working with coaches. Today he has an 
associate 
                   athletic director who handles those duties. Dodds is too 
busy 
                   closing new sponsorship deals, negotiating Big 12 
Conference 
                   television and radio contracts, glad-handing with 
boosters, 
                   serving on NCAA committees, and promoting his 
self-described 
                   "passion"--a college football championship tournament. 
Dodds 
                   believes critics of a post-season tournament for college 
                   football--the only major sport without a legitimate 
championship 
                   tournament--are, after years of debate, softening. If it 
were to 
                   happen, it would have to be approved within the next 18 
months, 
                   says Dodds, a "window" before negotiations for the next 
round of 
                   network television contracts kick into gear. Dodds thinks 
a 
                   college football championship would generate about $ 2 
million for 
                   each of the 120 or so schools playing Division I-A 
football. "I 
                   think that over a seven-year period a football playoff is 
worth 
                   several billion," he says. 

                   In the grand scheme of the college sports industry, $ 2 
million 
                   may not seem like much, but Dodds knows well that success 
comes 
                   with a price. After last season, when Brown took the 
Longhorns to 
                   a post-season bowl for the first time since 1990, Dodds 
ripped up 
                   the coach's original contract and signed him to a new 
ten-year 
                   deal worth $ 1 million annually. He added an annuity, 
largely 
                   funded by private donors, that will give Brown $ 1 million 
                   annually at age 60 should he remain another four years. 

                   By the way, Brown does earn more than the university 
president, 
                   Dr. Larry R. Faulkner, whose salary is $ 319,400. So does 
                   basketball coach Rick Barnes, who earns $ 750,000. But if 
you're 
                   looking for the sort of acrimony between sports and 
academics 
                   that tears so many schools apart, you won't find much of 
it here. 
                   "I have a lot of respect for Dodds, his inventiveness, and 
his 
                   way of keeping the organization attuned to opportunities," 
says 
                   Faulkner. "I've certainly paid attention to that." 

                   The football coach actually gets to "coach" about as much 
as Bill 
                   Gates gets to play videogames these days. His nine 
assistants 
                   structure and manage practices and deal with most routine 
player 
                   matters. Brown, like any top-level executive, is expected 
to be 
                   the company's outside guy. He's your COO with a whistle. 
Most of 
                   his hours are filled with media obligations (about two 
dozen 
                   television and radio stations and newspapers cover the 
                   Longhorns), fundraising (for the entire university as well 
as the 
                   athletic department), and trying to keep his own 
management team 
                   in place. (After last season, seven of his assistant 
coaches were 
                   offered head coaching jobs elsewhere; Brown kept them all, 
adding 
                   $ 250,000 to the department's payroll. Additionally, five 
coaches 
                   were granted annuities worth $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 at age 
60 if they 
                   hang on with Brown for four more years.) 

                   On occasion, Brown also telephones one of the many 
corporate 
                   executives who are big UT boosters, guys like Hicks and 
San 
                   Antonio car dealer Red McCombs, another alum and the owner 
of the 
                   NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Brown looks to Hicks for 
time-management 
                   advice and insights on coping with pressure. With McCombs 
he 
                   talks talent and tries to absorb some of the owner's 
upbeat 
                   attitude. ("Hey, you're talking to one of only two owners 
who're 
                   going to the Super Bowl," McCombs told Brown after an 
                   early-season Longhorn loss. At the time, the Vikings were 
1-2). 
                   "One of the things that's common in both of them is that 
they're 
                   high energy," says Brown. "They have the ability to dream, 
they 
                   have a lot of imagination, and they don't get down very 
much." In 
                   some areas, though, Brown is on his own. "The difference 
between 
                   their business and ours is that they can hire and fire who 
they 
                   want to," the coach said one October afternoon while 
lounging on 
                   one of the plush leather couches in his office. "In my 
business, 
                   we put our paychecks in the mouths of 18- to 22-year-olds 
we 
                   can't fire. It's like that ugly-baby theory--we can't get 
rid of 
                   them. So we have to hug them and teach them better. 
Another 
                   thing--CEOs don't have to deal with mothers. The major 
difference 
                   for us is the kids." 

                   Brown's kids were whooping it up with 80,000-plus Longhorn 
                   faithful on that October afternoon when the pop of the 
final gun 
                   signaled the end of the Nebraska game. Final score: Texas 
24, 
                   Nebraska 20. The victory was a turning point for the young 
                   Longhorns that propelled them to their finest season in 
years. 
                   Going into their last regular-season game against Texas 
A&M, the 
                   Longhorns have their best record (9-2) since winning ten 
games in 
                   1995--albeit one that ended in an atmosphere of tragedy. A 
week 
                   before the game 12 students were killed and 28 injured on 
the A&M 
                   campus while building a huge bonfire structure for a 
pregame 
                   rally. As FORTUNE went to press the game was scheduled to 
be 
                   played. 

                   This year the Longhorns have been ranked as high as sixth 
in the 
                   AP Top 25, their highest perch since 1996. Their reward? A 
                   possible trip to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in January, a 
                   prestigious bowl game despite its name. Each team in the 
game 
                   receives $ 1.5 million. To put it another way, the 
Nebraska 
                   victory paid off for the Longhorns like an Internet IPO. 
So 
                   while Dodds appeared calm amid the post-game celebrations, 
he 
                   was actually more relieved than anything. "If you don't 
win, 
                   you're not doing your job," he said. "And you don't 
survive." 

                   There have been times of real doubt in recent years at UT 
                   athletics as the program struggled to find its way back to 
                   football prominence in the '90s. But perhaps the most 
                   significant crisis occurred in 1992, when seven female 
athletes 
                   filed a lawsuit against the university charging that it 
had 
                   failed to comply with Title IX. When the suit was filed, 
about 
                   37% of UT's varsity athletes were women, and female 
athletes 
                   received about $ 1 million in scholarships, well short of 
the 
                   $ 2.8 million awarded to male varsity athletes. Some 
executives 
                   inside the department wanted to fight the charges. Recalls 
Jody 
                   Conradt, UT's women's athletic director and head coach of 
                   women's basketball: "Some folks said, 'Let's have a final 
war 
                   right here on the University of Texas campus, and let's 
just see 
                   who's right!' Thankfully, DeLoss and others said, 'That's 
not 
                   the way. We need to sit down and come up with a solution. 
" Just 
                   three days after negotiations began, the university 
settled, 
                   essentially agreeing to all demands. Today, 43% of the 
                   department's scholarship dollars are spent for female 
athletes, 
                   who represent 43.7% of UT's athletes. 

                   Dodds believes that if the esteemed founders of college 
sports 
                   had not spurned female athletes from the start, then the 
industry 
                   would not have endured the turmoil that ruling ignited. 
                   "Somebody, somewhere, made a big mistake," he says. 
"Somebody, 
                   somewhere, decided women didn't need to be in sports, and 
I don't 
                   know why we weren't smart enough to fix it sooner." 

                   The person most credited with nudging--some say 
shoving--Texas in 
                   the right direction on gender equity is Donna Lopiano, a 
longtime 
                   activist for equity for women in sports and now head of 
the 
                   Women's Sports Foundation. She became women's athletic 
director 
                   at the University of Texas in 1975, the first woman in the 
                   country to hold an AD title at a major university. Like 
many 
                   advocates for gender equity, she felt the university was 
dragging 
                   toward Title IX compliance, but as a university official 
she 
                   could not openly encourage students to challenge the 
university. 
                   Instead she handed out Title IX manuals and complaint 
forms from 
                   boxes she stashed behind her desk like candy at Halloween. 
"Must 
                   have done it hundreds of times, for 17 years," she says, 
laughing 
                   at the memory. "I had boxes of manuals and more boxes to 
replace 
                   them. I couldn't believe it when somebody finally did it." 
By 
                   "it," she means filed suit. 

                   "It took someone to be abrasive, pushy, and all the other 
                   adjectives her friends use for Donna," says Conradt. 
"Donna 
                   scares people. It wouldn't have happened any other way. No 
                   question, she's the most significant individual for what 
we've 
                   been able to achieve in women's athletics." 

                   Today women's athletics at UT has its own corporate 
structure 
                   and hierarchy. It shares resources with the men in many 
areas, 
                   but it has its own management team, led by Conradt, who, 
like 
                   Dodds, reports to university vice president Pat Ohlendorf. 
Only 
                   a handful of Division I programs are similarly structured. 
"I 
                   think young women need to see women as bosses," Conradt 
says. 
                   "If the [men's and women's] departments merged, how would 
women 
                   get the chance to run any of the areas? This way we have 
role 
                   models for student athletes." 

                   The women still have a long way to go before reaching 
parity in 
                   one critical area--fundraising. Last year gifts received 
by 
                   women's sports totaled only $ 250,000. But the women are 
not 
                   without their boosters, Red McCombs being the biggest. Two 
events 
                   led McCombs to an epiphany regarding women's sports. One 
came 
                   during what he described as a "good ol' Bubba" meeting 
about 
                   fundraising a few years back. When he asked the lone woman 
in the 
                   room to name the most generous donors for women's 
athletics, he 
                   recalls, "She looked at me like I was crazy and said, 'Mr. 
                   McCombs, there are none.'" 

                   Soon afterward, McCombs' young granddaughter told him that 
she 
                   could not find a girls' softball team to join. He realized 
that 
                   wasn't going to change as long as the woman in the good 
ol' Bubba 
                   meeting was right. So four years ago he wrote a check for 
$ 3 
                   million to the UT women's athletic program, the largest 
single 
                   gift to women's collegiate sports anyone can recall. 
Earlier this 
                   year the Red and Charline McCombs Softball Stadium opened 
on UT's 
                   campus. 

                   Title IX clearly stoked the growth in college sports 
programs a 
                   quarter-century ago, but where will the money come from to 
                   sustain future growth? There's at least some concern that 
college 
                   sports is already locked squarely in corporate America's 
cross 
                   hairs as the next sports-marketing frontier. For years 
only the 
                   likes of Nike, Reebok, and other sports brands had major 
deals 
                   with college teams. Now high-tech companies like eBay and 
Nextel 
                   are lining up alongside soft-drink, financial-services, 
and 
                   entertainment companies to sell their products and 
services to 
                   your kids. Companies once worried about being called crass 
for 
                   slapping logos on college campuses. Today there is no 
shame. Take 
                   the annual Texas-Oklahoma game, the meeting of two of the 
most 
                   celebrated rivals in college football history. For two 
years now 
                   it has been called the Dr Pepper Red River Shootout, also 
                   sponsored by Southwestern Bell, Mercedes-Benz, Bank of 
America, 
                   Miller Brewing, and the Texas Land & Cattle Co., a local 
                   restaurant chain. It's worth in excess of $ 100,000 to 
each 
                   school. Be very afraid. 

                   For now, corporate deals remain only a minor revenue 
source for 
                   most big colleges. But as TV money and ticket prices peak, 
and 
                   donors get short arms and can't reach their wallets (after 
a 
                   couple of dog seasons, you'll see what I mean), it could 
become 
                   the most vital source of future growth. Texas' new deal 
with 
                   Nike, for instance, provides UT athletics with up to $ 1.8 
million 
                   in Nike gear, along with $ 850,000 in cash annually for 
the next 
                   nine years. That's equal to the largest sponsorship deal 
in 
                   college sports, and more than twice the value of the 
department's 
                   previous contract with Reebok. 

                   While Dodds is mindful of the need to maintain some 
boundaries 
                   against unbridled commercialism, he's more concerned that 
some 
                   major college programs may be forced out of big-time 
football 
                   altogether because they can't keep up with escalating 
costs. 
                   Sometimes the scale of all this makes Dodds wistful. "What 
I'd 
                   like to do is maybe start over with this whole thing," he 
says, 
                   "because it's gotten to the point where you don't control 
it, you 
                   manage it, and it's a challenge." 

                   Nevertheless: Texas is banking on being a leader in 
e-commerce 
                   for college sports. Sales through its nascent Website are 
almost 
                   nil. But with nearly a half-million Texas Exes out 
here--and 
                   Longhorn football on a roll--the upside is vast. Hook 'em, 
iHorns? 

                   On that Saturday afternoon in the fall when the Longhorns 
grew 
                   up against Nebraska, an elderly fan in dark glasses sat 
quietly 
                   on the front row of a luxury box at the stadium named in 
his 
                   honor. Darrell Royal is still greeted as "Coach Royal" 
around 
                   Austin. He's in awe of his surroundings, amazed that the 
program 
                   he helped build has become a multimillion-dollar 
operation. He 
                   never had to raise funds as a coach, never had to do 
anything 
                   but coach--and, well, fix the place up a bit. "When I 
first got 
                   here in 1954, there was a broken-down old shack in the end 
                   zone," he says. "Caretaker lived there. It took a few 
years, but 
                   we finally got it torn down." He laughed at another 
                   recollection: He couldn't understand why fans refused to 
sit in 
                   an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and 
                   realized that there were no bathrooms up there. 

                   Coach Royal doesn't much bother Dodds with advice anymore, 
though 
                   he did mention one thing a while back: "I told him, 
'Nothing 
                   makes Texans as happy as winning, and it's happy folks 
that 
                   give.'" Like any good executive, Dodds listened well.

Dan,  The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in 
the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a 
credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.  I have a form of mortgage 
agreement which works with this type of deal.  I would guess credit needs to 
make that call.  Let me know if you want the form.

   

Dan,
 Please check the revised agreement to see that I have included all that is 
necessary.  Since Quantum is doing the work for themselves, I did not include 
the Construction Agreement.  Please call if you have any questions.  I will 
forward to Gerald to see if he thinks I need to include any other items.  

Attached is the form of amendment to the Dow Brining and Cavern Lease 
Agreement.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Laura,  Heard it around town that today is your birthday.  Happy Birthday!

Gerald

Nothing planned for Sat.  

My home phone is (713) 942-8066 and my cell is (281) 772-9250.  Give me a 
call and let's try and hook up.  

Attached is a clean and redlined versions of the Gateway and Rio Nogales with 
the revisions we discussed.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward 
to Pace.  Merry Christmas.

Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the 
money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have 
exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any 
existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are 
subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in 
Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing 
security interest.

Dan,  Please review.  I will be in tommorrow morning and we can discuss and 
changes needed.

You have probably done this already, but remove any reference to SCADA in the 
Alstom agreement.

The Alstom load is small.  It just peaks real fast and hard.  We don't need 
SCADA here.  With the loss of the Wyman Gordon load, we will be left with 
only the Cypress Fairbanks city gate and Alstom on the 12" (4007) line, so 
line pack will handle whatever instantaneous pull Alstom should develop.

I received the e-mail.  Thanks.

This memo is regarding an agreement with the following title:  ENERGY 
SERVICES AGREEMENT BETWEEN PLANERGY SERVICES OF HOUSTON, INC. AND ENRON 
COMPRESSION SERVICES COMPANY (the "Agreement").

Enron Compression Services Company (ECS) has an agreement with Planergy by 
which ECS and Planergy share in the energy savings from the certain equipment 
at the new Bammel compression station.  The Agreement states that we "...will 
forward the recorded hours of operation for the previous month to Planergy 
within (15) days of the 1st day of the month."  We are currently working with 
Planergy and the Bammel team to design the report that will track the hours 
of use for the subject equipment.  

I would like to suggest that the Bammel team fax the recorded hours before 
the 15th day of the following month to those listed below:

Cheryl Marshall (Asset Management)- fax 713-646-8416
Carol Carter (ECS accounting) - fax 713-646-3084
Roger Roedick (Planergy) - fax 713-468-1457

If anyone disagrees with this idea, please call Cheryl at 713-853-6250.

Gerald - as it relates to the Agreement - who are we doing business as?  
Please let Carol Carter know also.

Steve, Attached is a short bullet point list of the results of our transport

 The Pipeline Joint Defense Group/TECALA, of which HPL is a member, has 
invited Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Tony Garza to come to Houston to 
meet with the group.   I have tentatively offered to include as part of the 
meeting a tour of the Enron Gas Control Room (can you do that, James?) for 
Chairman Garza and a small number of people from the Group (maybe about a 
dozen).  We would like a larger number of representatives from companies 
which are members of the Group to attend the general informal discussion with 
Chairman Garza, probably at either the Enron Building, The Met, or otherwise 
nearby.  Tentative dates are June 23 and June 30, probably in the middle of 
the day with lunch.
 Please let me know whether or not you would like to attend the meeting, and 
if so what date(s) work for you, and I will pass the information on to Roxann 
Neumann, who is coordinating the meeting.  If you think any others would like 
to attend, give me a call (36417) or cc:mail.

Steve, Here it is.  Enjoy.

Let's talk.

David Juist <DRJ@topsoe.com> on 01/12/2000 05:18:35 PM
Dear Gerald:

In accordance with our conversation of yesterday regarding the Agreement
to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (the "Upgrade
Agreement") I have reviewed the documents and investigated the location
of the metering station; the results are as follows:

* The existing sales contract provides quality and pressure
obligations.
* The existing sales contract provides for measurement of the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for noncompliance with
quality obligations.
* As you indicated, the existing sales contract provides you have
no obligation to odorize the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for the installation of
meters by Enron.  Part of the metering equipment was replaced under the
existing sales contract pursuant to an amendment (I will be pleased to
provide you a copy if you wish).
* The existing sales contract states that HTI is responsible for
all taxes except specifically excluded taxes; taxes measured by net
income are in the list of excluded taxes.
* The HPL Facilities are on property owned by HTI.  Accordingly,
company policy dictates that any subcontractor coming on HTI premises
must carry certain types of insurance that provides for certain
endorsements.  A sample provision is attached to this message.

On the basis of the meeting held in our offices on Monday with
representatives of your company, Niels Udengaard, our Vice President,
was under the impression that the Upgrade Agreement was no longer
required.  We are prepared to handle the matter in the manner formerly
used to replace metering equipment.

Please let me have your comments.

Sincerely,
Haldor Topsoe, Inc.

Kay,  Please review the attached.  Thanks.

Brad,  Please reviewed the attached before we send to MidCon for their 
review.  Pay particular attention to the pressure committment sections. 
Thanks.

Steve,  Let's take out the reference to approaching the FERC in this letter.  
I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and 
while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response 
little reason to believe otherwise.  Suggest that any further delay would 
require us to explore all our options for access into CMS.

At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to 
go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.   Let me know if you want to 
discuss this further.  

   

Gerald,

Please provide your comments, I would like to have this sent to their offices 
tomorrow by courrier no later than 10am.

Please provide any comments or suggestions.

Thanks,

Steve Morse

FYI.  Looks like it did have review after all.

OK.  Sounds great.  Thanks for the follow-up.

Hi Ryan,

I'm at DEMA right now setting up all of this year's dive trips!  I got a
message from my office mates saying they had to box me up and move me to a
temporary office in the Woodlands.  We have to make room for the HR people,
but there isn't any room for us downtown yet.

The three of you guys can just show up at the HammerHeads meeting.  There
should be a reserved section somewhere.  We normally have a few beers and
talk about dive stuff.  There will probably be lots of pictures from the
small group trip to Belize in October.  Also, Kennie and I will be going over
this year's events and trips.

Can you forward Eric's email to me?  Whatever I have written down is
incorrect.

See you soon,
Kristi

GT,   That sounds great on the house. What are you remodeling?  The carpet 
and kitchen?  

I have been out chasing some myself.   It is amazing how may screwed women 
there are out there.  Some good looking ones though.

I am out of town the next couple of weekends, but some time after that would 
be good.  Early February around the 12th or any time thereafter.  Sounds like 
you are going to be busy moving in the house during that time also.  Let me 
know.

Hey G,

Good to here from you. I have been busy having the house remodeled. I am
moving in on the 29th. I started school Tuesday. I didn't realize how many
women are in the college mode. My neck hurt boy.

I have been chasing a little tail here and there. Nothing to right home
about.

I am ready to come to Houston. When is a good weekend?

How are you doing? I hope you are getting laid. You deserve it.

Talk to you later
GT

Happy Birthday to You!
  Happy Birthday to You!
 Happy Birthday dear Sharona!
Happy Birthday to You!

Love,  Gerald

It worked,  You guys are officially online now.  Everything here is fine.  

I will likely have a roommate in the next couple of weeks.  A friend of mine 
who also works at Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland.  This will 
work out great and also help me with the mortgage payments.  

Take care and talk to you later.

Gerald

Lisa,  Attached is a spreadsheet which divides the property.  Please review 
and note the following:

1.  No values for the 401K's are in the sheet.   Blank at this time.
2.  The blue values can be changed and the sheet should adjust accordingly.
3.  Please review the calculations behind the cells to understand how I am 
calculating the values on the sheet.

If you want to sit down and go over this together at your convenience, I 
would be happy to do so.
If you find something upsetting, please call and let's discuss before you 
talk to anyone else.

Gerald

Thanks for all your work on the trip Amy.  I'll tell Dan you deserve a big 
raise.

	
	

Randy,

I'd like to speak with you this morning.  I'm having Gerald research Texas 
law on: (i) failure of conditions precedent resulting in failure to form a 
contract  and (ii) breach of contract sufficient to afford termination as a 
remedy for breach.  Any help you can offer today in your shop on these 2 
issues would be appreciated.  Our guys want to issue a termination notice as 
soon as possible.  I want to know what common law of contract says before we 
do.  

Call me when you get a chance.

Steve

The docs should be with Carolyn Gilley in Contract Records.

Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any 
Enron entities have with the following companies:

Bay Gas Storage
Energy South

Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
information.  Thanks for your help.

By the time of this meeting, I will be about $10,000 richer with a 6 ft. tall 
half-clothed showgirl on each arm.  So please send Kristi my greetings!    
When upon learning I will not be in attendance, she goes into a deep state of

OK, I will reconsider, but only if she grovels.

Ryan,
The Outback Pub is on Fountainview between Richmond and Westheimer.  If
you're familiar with that area on Richmond, it's near Barry's Pizza and Dave
& Buster's.

See you there,
Kristi
 

Mark,  Please review the attached form of amendments.  I have also prepared 
the form of amendment for the O&M Agreements, but will hold until you get 
further information on the fee arrangements.

After you review these forms, lets discuss and review where we are at in this 
whole process.  We will need to get TW, Accounting, and Investor review of 
these as soon as possible.

Kay,  Could you send me a copy of the draft of the HNG Agreement.  Thanks

Gerald:  I don't find any executer agreements with or pertaining to either 
entity.  We have a draft agreement with HNG Storage about our possible 
financing of their purchase of Energy South, but I don't have an executed 
agreement - that was in September.

Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any 
Enron entities have with the following companies:

Bay Gas Storage
Energy South

Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
information.  Thanks for your help.

Lets skin that smoke wagon!

I noticed that there was one bio missing.  So here goes,

Jim,  Attached are the interconnect agreements for the MidCon Flagstaff 
(formerly Greens Bayou) and Deer Park points.  The pressure of 550 psig is in 
the Flagstaff agreement.  Please review and if acceptable please forward to 
MidCon.  

Steve,  Attached is the confidentiality agreement.

Las Vegas was alot of fun.  The weather was awesome.  In the 60s with clear 
skies.  However, I had no luck at gambling.  The cards just weren't falling 
for me in Black Jack.

Yes, a friend of mine from Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland, so 
this is working out great.  Very close to getting the divorce finalized.  
Should be done in a week or two.  Talk to you later and hope all finds you 
well.  

Hi Gerald,      How's it going?  Fine I hope. We are all O.K. It"s been cold
the last few days. So you are going to have a roommate.  That ought to help
you out a lot, plus you"ll have some company. I heard you went to Las Vegas
over the weekend. Did you have fun. How much did you win .  Was the weather
cold or not. Talked to Paul Saturday and he said you went there. So is there
any progress on your divorce or not. Let us know what is happening. Well all
for now Dad and I send our love.    Love  Mom.

Pat, I will be out the 4, 7, and 8th of Feb.

I hope you guys caught the OU/Texas game on Big Monday last night - the
Sooners handed Texas their worst loss of the year.  In keeping with that
theme:

This is the transcript of a recent episode of Jeopardy!

COMMENTATOR: Welcome to Longhorn Jeopardy! And the host of Longhorn
Jeopardy, here's Alex Trebek.

(Applause).

ALEX: Thank you. And let's welcome our contestants, Connie, Tom and Gary.
You all know how the game's played.
So let's take a look at our Longhorn Jeopardy categories: Egyptian Art,
Has-Been College Football Dynasties, U.S. Foreign Policy, Famous Con Men,
Greek Mythology, Hilarious Sports Excuses, Recruiting Experts, and Diet
Fads.
Connie, you're our defending champion, so you control the board.

CONNIE: Alex, Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $200.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program hasn't won a national
championship in 30 years, and hasn't had a top 10 finish in 17 years, but
their fans think they're on par with Florida State and Penn State...Connie.

CONNIE: What is Oklahoma?

ALEX: No. Tom?

TOM: What is Texas?

ALEX: Correct. The Longhorns' last national title in the final AP poll was
in 1969, and last top 10 finish was in 1983. Tom, you control the board.

TOM: Let's stay with Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $600.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program bills itself as a national title
contender for the 2000 season, yet is coming off a three-game losing streak
and hasn't scored an offensive touchdown in its last 10 quarters...Gary.

GARY: What is Texas?

ALEX: Yes, Texas. I could see all of you buzzed in very quickly, but Gary
barely got in there first. Remember, the Longhorns offense didn't score a
touchdown in the last half of the A&M game, and all of the Nebraska and
Arkansas debacles. Gary, you control.

GARY: Alex, let's try Famous Con Men for $800.

ALEX: The answer is...This American made outlandish promises to his blind
followers, selling them a bill of goods and leading them to believe
prosperity
was around the corner...Gary?

GARY: Who was David Koresh?

ALEX: No...Connie?

CONNIE: Who was Jim Jones?

ALEX: No.

(Long pause). BOOP-BOOP!

ALEX: The answer is, Who was Mack Brown? Mack Brown, the Texas football
coach. I can tell the way you're hitting your hand on your head and nodding,
that's something you should have known. Just remember, contestants, it's
good advice to go with your first instinct. Gary, you still control.

GARY: Alex, Recruiting Experts for $400.

ALEX: The answer is...His football recruiting lists always excite fans in
the Hill Country, but the majority fail to live up to the hype...Gary?

GARY: Who is the Amazing Kreskin?

ALEX: No. Connie?

CONNIE: Who is Bobby Burton?

ALEX: Yes. Bobby Burton, the man who never met a UT commitment he couldn't
over-hype. Connie, you control.
CONNIE: Hilarious Sports Excuses for $600.

(WOO-WOO!)

ALEX: The Daily Double! Connie, you have $400. How much will you wager?

CONNIE: I'll risk all of it, Alex.

ALEX: All of it, OK. The answer is...Mack Brown blamed this on a College
Station hotel for UT's loss to Texas A&M.

CONNIE: What is no strawberry cream cheese for the breakfast bagels,
and...(dramatic pause) lukewarm orange juice?

ALEX: Correct! Both were blamed for the Longhorns' 20-16 loss. We'll be back
to meet the contestants right after this.

something, but I will take it in a humorous manner.  

Remember,  Be strong and confident.

Attached is a draft for your review.  Please review and lets discuss any 
comments.

  After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the 
amendments should work in their present form.  The 2,500 Western gas needs to 
be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.   Exception should 
read "Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area 
shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the 
agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.  Any 
decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 
2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production 
levels."

I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.

Attached are the latest revisions.  The Compression Admin. Agreement includes 
a clean and redlined version.  Please review.

Thanks for the note.  Hope you and Will have a wonderful Valentines Day.

Nice job on the photos.   Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain 
times.  The good thing is that the "Dude" I met in Joe's and I are now pen 
pals and he will be coming to Houston to visit very soon.  Maybe he was my 
long lost brother.  I am making a phone call to my Mom right now too see if 
she has anything she wants to explain to me.

Steve,  Do you have an executed copy of the Trunkline Confidentiality 
Agreement for the LNG terminal in Lake Charles?  Need to get one for our

That's not funny!

Revision:  HPL will operate to the outlet flange of the regulation (not 
separation) equipment as reflected on Jim's drawing that will be Exhibit A.

Steve -HPL- Schneider
02/07/2000 05:40 PM
I have talked to Dan McWhirter with CPS and the agreement needs to altered to 
reflect the following, as needed.  HPL will construct a tap, tap valve, 
riser, and check valve off the South Texas 30" JV pipeline, with EFM and 
SCADA equipment on the meter facilities.  We will own, operate and maintain 
such facilities , but will be reimbursed (with IRS tax gross-up) by CPS.  
Ownership will break at the outlet flange of the check valve, plus the EFM 
and SCADA equipment.  CPS will construct and own the remainder of the 
facilities installed, such facilities to the outlet flange of the separation 
facilities (including tank and secondary containment)  being installed to 
HPL's specs.  HPL will operate and maintain these facilities.  Our EFM will 
be custody transfer, with their EFM being check measurement.  Such facilities 
are to be installed so that HPL remotely controls the volume flow through the 
meter.  All maintenance costs on this sector will be paid by HPL and 
reimbursed by CPS upon invoice.  Any maintenance expenditure over $3,000 per 
event will require pre-notification to CPS.  All other facilities downstream 
of separation with be constructed, owned, operated and maintained by CPS.  As 
compensation for handling the separation facilities and liquids recovered, 
CPS pre-transfers ownership and title to such recovered liquids to HPL and 
warrants title to HPL.  Jim Haden will provide a revised Exhibit A depicting 
the facilities and the ownership break point.  Jim, you need to review and 
approve the facilities to be installed above to our specifications, as 
required.  If you have any questions, please call.

It is all about drinking with you isn't it?  You need to get a grip.   I will 
have to pass on the Rudz Suds as I will be dining at one of Houston's finer 
eateries with captains of industry tonight.  However, Eric and I were kicking 
around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this 
weekend.  Saturday or Sunday? Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might 
be interested? 

Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!  Just to anticipate 
the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a "Smart Ass" right 
now.

It is showing up on my computer and seems to be working.

Upon reading the e:mail message shown below, I immediatedly went to 
Start/Programs/Infobasis and I found no WINFASTER application.  The 
applications that were available were Croporate Workbook 3.0c & 4.1, 
Disclosure, Enron Corporate Datasheets, Gas and Power Daily Web Page and 
Phone Book.

Given that I requested and Joya Davis processed the request for the FASTR 
Database for me, Gerald Nemec and Shonnie Daniel in early January, it is 
really a shame that so many people's time has been wasted with this matter.  

Please figure out why the program is not showing up on my computer.  Is it 
showing up on Gerald's and Shonnie's?

it is under Start / Programs / Infobasis.   He is in the group.

RFP,   I had a good time also.  The bands were interesting though.  I bet 
that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance.  

The date was actually  her call.  We are meeting some of her friends out for 
dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.  Seriously, this girl is 
cool and a lot of fun.  Should be a good time.  Of course I am assuming that 
the date is still on.  In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz 
(a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.   I really have no idea what I said 
to her.  She may not be speaking to me anymore.

What was with Willis last night?  No show!

Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston.

Thanks for coming out last night--funny how that sentence could be miss
interpreted.  Seriously though, folks, it was pretty fun even though the
bands were less that par.  We need to do more hanging out, especially now
that Eric won't let us have sex with his wife.  I'm looking forward to some
jams and a trip back down to the Gulf this weekend.  Good luck on the
date--what's the plans?

Attached is Exhibit C to the Gallup O&M Agreement.  The original document 
left this Exhibit to follow later.   We also still owe you Exhibit B 
(Description of Compressor Motor Facilities) to the O&M Agreement and Exhibit 
B to the CSA (Proposed form of No. 21 Schedule).  These will follow shortly.

 

Attached for your review is the letter agreement which locks in the Gas 
Conversion Agreement pricing. 

Just received this.

On the Sofregaz Agreement, I changed the Excess Umbrella Liability Insurance 
coverage to a $10,000,000 amount.  This was noted in a letter to Normand 
Grenier, Sofregaz's Attorney, and they had no objections to this.  I forgot 
to change this amount on the contract I sent for internal review, but it was 
changed on the contract that I sent to Sofregaz for execution.  Please find 
attached a copy of the final document I sent for execution showing the 
$10,000,000 excess liability amount.

Jaime,  Attached is a firm sales agreement form which ECT utilizes in  North 
America.  A lot of the form may not be relevant given the fact that (i) Pemex 
is both the seller and transporter and (ii)  unless you are near the border, 
there are no alternative sources to Pemex.  However, it is a good starting 
point.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.  I think our dive 
captain is checking availability.  Of course our dive captain is also 
hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.  I told him that with 
a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing.

Let us know what your schedule is.  See if we can't hook up Thursday or 
Friday for lunch.  I open and I am sure Nacious E would be too.

True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to 
chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go back 
to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers can 
cruise so successfully in tight slacks!

Things are going well with little Cynthia.  She is really fun and easy to 
talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each

As for lunch, I'd like to get together although we break for lunch around 11
over here and that's more like breakfast for you fat-cat lawyer-types.  I'm
down here all week, so let me know if you want to try for something.  Maybe
Friday would be fun?  I'd have a lot more flexibility in my schedule on that
day.

Looks like Saturday is "pay your friend-dues day" at the Gillaspie Ranch.
Seems like all I do is move his ass.  All I know is that he better keep us

Anywho, what's up with you and the little lady?  She seemed really together.
Hope things are progressing well--if that's your intentions.

Hey you hosers, what's up with swimming with the fishys?  Are we going to

Sorry about the mix up on lunch yesterday.  Let me know if you want to try

Tracy,  

Thanks for the pictures.  Cute kid.  Frank does look like you.  I need to 
come by and see Frank in person.  Sorry that I have been out of the loop for 
some time but sometimes life is weird.  

I am sure Tom told you that Lisa and I are getting divorced.  It is still 
hard for me to comprehend this, but all I can do is continue to move forward 
with my life.  Anyway, hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending 
pictures.   

Gerald

Hey Gerald!? I thought you may like to see  some pictures of Frank and 
Madeline.? I got one that looks like my side of  the family this time!?

Yes I am!  Let me know what time you are available and where you are this 
week and I will pick an appropriate location.   G$ and Nacious E are 
available.

You need a nickname too.  Let's ponder this one and submit ideas.

True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife
to chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go
back to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers
can cruise so successfully in tight slacks!

Things are going well with little Cynthia.  She is really fun and easy to
talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each
others company.

I too, am somewhat hesitant about those large toothed critters, although
I'm
sure they'd much rather chomp into Eric's ass-steak rather than my boney
carcass.  I figure if everyone else does it why shouldn't we?

As for lunch, I'd like to get together although we break for lunch around
11
over here and that's more like breakfast for you fat-cat lawyer-types.  I'm
down here all week, so let me know if you want to try for something.  Maybe
Friday would be fun?  I'd have a lot more flexibility in my schedule on
that
day.

Looks like Saturday is "pay your friend-dues day" at the Gillaspie Ranch.
Seems like all I do is move his ass.  All I know is that he better keep us
well hydrated.

Anywho, what's up with you and the little lady?  She seemed really
together.
Hope things are progressing well--if that's your intentions.

Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.  I think our dive
captain is checking availability.  Of course our dive captain is also
hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.  I told him that
with a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing.

Mark,  Attached is a draft of the power agreement with my changes redlined 
in.  I still have a few more, but wanted to get the majority of these to you 
asap.  Targeting Monday to forward to CDEC.

Everything is going well.  Sorry I haven't gotten back to you, but I have 
been really busy at work and with other things.  I will give a call when I 
get a chance.

Hi Gerald,           How are things going. Fine I hope we are all O.K. I
called the other night and left a message just wanted to talk voice mail for
a  change.!!!!!!!! Have been busy working in the yard. Had to trim all the
shrubs and get rid of all the dead plants.    So what have you been doing.
Anything new going on with you. James started planting this week. He is
trying to get that moisture before it drys out.  We didn't get  any rain
today again.  Starting to look bad.  I'm keeping Jenna and Jake tomorrow.
Janice has a doctors appoitment. Nothing serous just a follow up. Got ashort
email from Paul yesterday he's doing o.k...........Well all for now Dad and
I send our love....Bye for now.

Love...MOM

Attached is a clean and redline version with my changes.  I made a few 
further refinements to the agreement.  I think it would be a good idea to 
walk CDEC through these changes as a lot of these are form not substance.

Attached is a draft of the Contractor Protocols which work with the services 
agreements of Hanover Measurement Services Company (Stone Entity) which were 
circulated by Mary Cook last week.  Please review in conjunction with the 
services agreements and provide comments

.

Mark,  Please disregard the prior versions and review this one.  This 
includes Section 1.4 which requires CDEC to provide us access with the load 
projection systems that are in place.

Janet,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Confidentiality 
Agreement (Trunkline) with the revisions we discussed.  Please review.  Bobby 
Gaspard with Trunkline, asked that I forward the revised draft via email and 
after their review an executable.  Please forward to Bobby for his review at 
bjgaspard@cmsenergy.com if you are okay with this draft.

Looks like we got another one.  Sounds like we duplicate the agreement we 
create for Ginger and use for this interconnect.  Let's discuss when we get a 
chance.

Cheryl Lantz Marshall on 03/01/2000 09:48:59 AM
Hello!  I have been told that you are the interconnect guru.  I think I 
called you a couple of weeks ago with a warning on this one.  What 
information do you need from me to get started on an interconnect agreement 
with Tejas?  The purpose of this interconnect is to deliver 2-3 days of gas 
while we lower the line that feeds the city of Kingsville.  In addition, we 
will keep the interconnect in place as back-up to the city.  Please read the 
attached memo for additional details.  Please note that we would like to have 
this project completed within 3 weeks.
Kenneth W Kaase on 02/29/2000 09:36:42 AM
Per Billy Sheilds at Tejas, the cost for a 3" meter and tap is $ 27,000. The 
estimate does not
include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting 
HPL to provide.
To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a 
contract needs
to be entered into for all gas delivered from Tejas to HPL at this point. All 
cost incurred for
 the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas.

Well it looks like Eric is now officially burden with an oppressive 
mortgage.  Won't be long before he is out mowing the lawn in Bermuda short 
and sandals with black socks.  Eventually all the good ones go down.  

What up with you, JT?

Ken,  This is the complete document.  The schedule are attached to it.

Stephanie,  I forwarded a hard copy of the operational control letter 
yesterday.  Let me know if you don't have it.  Attached is the price letter.

There is no formal contract in place between TW and EE&CC for the 
construction.  Both TW and ECS as I understand, have signed AFE's with EE&CC 
for the projects.  We will most likely have to address this risk in the 
Contribution Agreement.  I will talk with Mark and Mark about this.

PPA- we are expecting comments back from CDEC late today.  Schedule is now to 
review their comments and meet with them Tuesday (via phone or in person) to 
finalize.  We can likely get Patti a copy after Tuesday.

Contribution Agreement - Pending resolution of the construction risk issues, 
we can have a draft for Patti early next week.

GT,   What's up?  Got that house in order yet?  Keeps you busy doesn't it.  
Hope everything is going well.

 I and the redfaced Eric are thinking about a road trip to Austin on the 
weekend of March 18th.  A band we really want to check out (Tenacious D) is 
playing at La Zona Rosa on Sat. the 18th.  Are you going to be around that 
weekend?  We have confirmation via some web site that Tenacious D will be 
there, but have tried calling La Zona Rosa about tix with no success.  Do you 
know anything about this place?  Are the concerts usually walk up tix sales?

Let me know what your schedule looks like.   Oh yeah, Eric's wife Jennifer 
will probably accompany him to Austin.  Eric couldn't get a hall pass for the 
weekend.

Attached is a clean and redlined version of the agreement with my changes 
after discussion with Dick Shirley and Fred Lackey this morning.  I will also 
fax a copy to them.

Sure.  Let me know when and where.

   
	
	

Hi - Would you like to have dinner next week?  Maybe Thursday?  It's Chris' 
spring break and I told her I'd help her start packing since she moves out at 
the end of the month.  She'll be leaving Thursday afternoon to go to work so 
I won't be needing to help her Thursday night.  Just let me know if you are 
interested.

Lisa

Paul,  I am still here.  Where the heck are you?  I guess you are back in the 
States by now.  What are you guy's up to?  How many kids do you have now?

As for Lisa and I, we are still DINKs (Double Income No Kids) in Houston.  I 
am officially an attorney now working in the corporate legal department of 
I still keep up with George and Ernie occasionally.  George still lives in 
Austin and is single.  I visit him a couple of times a year.  You wouldn't 
believe it.  He still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in 
college.  Kind of like stepping into a time warp.  Ernie just finished 
getting his MBA at UT this spring.  He will be working in San Antonio for 
Frito Lay (no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it).  He 
now has a little girl with another kid on the way.  I think due sometime this 
summer.  He has really changed since undergrad.  A responsible young man now.

How are Mom and Pop Bieraugel doing? (Is the Big 10 going to take it in the 
shorts this year?)  Are they still in the Washington area?  Lisa had talked 
to your mom about a year ago when she was trying to track you down for my 
graduation party.  Sounded like all was well in the Bieraugel household.  I 
think she said John was in Alaska?

Anyway, drop me a note when you get a chance.  It is really great to hear 
from you again.  We need to keep in touch.

Gerald, 

That sounds fine.  

I haven't recieved any further mail for you from Shell.  I think you said 
there should be more coming.

girl at this point.  

I'll let you know more early next week about the road trip.  Take care.  

 You wouldn't happen to know someone who could get us cheap South by 
Southwest passes.  We think we will need those passes to see Tenacious D.

G$

Gerald,

How are you buddy? Good to here from you. I will have room for you on the
18th but my nephew will be staying at my house and maybe my mom and neice
too so Eric really needs to get a hotel room. The couch is waiting for you
dude. I only have dinner plans for the 18th. There is a Mardi Gras party to
go to on the 17th thrown by the No Le Hace bunch. Let me know if you are
coming into town.

Are you dating anyone? I am dating a young thing named Heather. She is
really cool.

The house is looking good. They are doing brick work on the front as we
speak.

Hope to here from you.

Hello!   Hope your day is going well.  As for me, it has been pretty busy.  
Dropped my tux off at lunch and it only took about 2 seconds.  I know you 
were looking forward to going with me to drop that off, but you missed out.  

I had a great time this weekend.  Thanks again for accompanying me to the UH

Attached is the form of CA.  Set up as a bilateral for asset deals 
primarily.  Easily adjusted to suit your needs though.

If Men TRULY Ran The World...

1.  Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a
"Nice hustle, you'll get'em next time" would pretty much do it.

2.  Birth control would come in ale or lager.

3.  Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would
only occur in leap years.

4.  On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day
off to go drinking. Mother's Day too.

5.  St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same.
But it would be celebrated every month.

6.  Garbage would take itself out.

7.  Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and
pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event
in world history.

8.  The only show opposite "Monday Night Football" would be
"Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle."

9.  Instead of "beer-belly," you'd get "beer-biceps."

10. Tanks would be far easier to rent.

11. Two words..."Ally McNaked."

12. When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you
responded with would actually reduce your fine. As in: Cop: "You know how
fast you were going?"   You: "All I know is, I was spilling my beer all
over the place."  Cop: "Nice one, That's $10.00 off".

13. People would never talk about how fresh they felt.

14. Daisy Duke shorts would never go out of style again.

15. Every man would get four, real Get Out of Jail Free cards
per year.

16. Telephones would cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.

17. It would perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as
you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.

18. Instead of a fancy, expensive engagement ring, you could
present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said "You're #1!".

19. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during
the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during
a time-out.

20. Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an
acceptable response to "I love you."

21. The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.

22. "Sorry I'm late, but I got wasted last night," would be an
acceptable excuse for tardiness.

23. At the end of the workday a whistle would blow and you
would jump out of your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and
right into your car like Fred Flintstone.

24. Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating
the "public ugliness" ordinance.

25. Hallmark would make "Sorry, what was your name again?"
cards.

Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   

Attached is the final version of the Bammel Compression Turnkey Construction 
Agreement used in Project Looper.  This agreement will require some 
modification for use in Project Coca-Cola, but is a good starting point.  In 
the interest of efficiency I am circulating this for your review and 
comments.  We can then discuss how this needs to be tailored for the CO2 
project.  Please note the following with respect to this agreement:

 1.  A detailed engineering scope of work will be required for the treaters.
 2.  Given the financing objectives for this project, this agreement should 
be as lump sum price as possible with liquidated damages for in-service 
date        risk.
 3.    A performance criteria guarantee section will need to be added which 
references specific plant peformance criteria in the scope of work. 

 FYI, I will be in Albuquerque tommorrow for a Compression Services project.  
After your review let's discuss.

Mark,  The letter with my comments incorporated.

David,  Attached is a short term sheet agreement that I propose we put into 
place for the Gallup electric driver which EECC is installing for Enron 
Compression Services Company.  As I understand it now, we have only an AFE 
with signature for this deal in place.   As I indicated on my voice mail, I 
need something more substantial in place for assignment, since we are selling 
a portion of this project off to investors.  Please review and lets discuss.  
Timing unfortunately is not long as usual.  I would like to meet as soons as 
your schedule allows.  Thanks.

Hey bro, looks like we got LSU next.

Hey, what is your email address?  The one you give to somebody outside of 
Enron.

Bruce

Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.  I 
would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation. 

Note:  We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement 
in place for assignment to the LLC.  ECS retains payment obligation under the 
construction agreement even after assignment into the LLC.  Thanks for your 
help.

FYI,  The issue we discussed this morning.

Nora Dobin@ENRON

The Kachina LLC agreement is being amended and restated to accomplish Gallup 
transactions as part of existing Kachina LLC.  The existing Kachina LLC 
agreement currently does not contain a provision giving non-Enron equity 
holders a right to remove the Managing Member with or without cause but does 
give these holders numerous veto rights over actions proposed by the Managing 
Member.  Notwithstanding these veto rights, AA seemed to indicate during our 
meeting earlier this week a desire to include a removal provision.  

Please consider the following:

Given use of existing Kachina structure, do we do need to include removal 
provision as part of amendment and restatement of Kachina LLC or can we table 
this issue for now? 

If we do need to include a removal provision, attached is some proposed 
language which (i) gives non-Enron equity interests right to remove Managing 
Member at any time with or without cause, (ii) requires simultaneous 
appointment of another Member as Managing Member, and (iii) if removal is of 
initial Managing Member (i.e., Enron entity), then initial Managing Member 
has option to cause dissolution of LLC.  

Thanks, NJD

David,  Attached is the agreement with the revisions we discussed.  Please 
review.  I tried to redline againt the previous version, but any section that 
I modified displayed as an entire rewrite of the section.  Maybe you will 
have better luck redlining.  Please call with any questions.  X 33512.

Got the redline to work.  Attached is the redlined version of the 
construction agreement.

I reviewed these changes and they look fine.  Please prepare the 
executables.  Thanks.

Gerald and Eric,
Attached is a redline of the Interconnect Agreement.  I have also included a 
letter that I want to send with the revised contract.  I have committed to 
respond early in the week of March 20th.  I will be out, but if you have any 
questions, please contact Ned Higgins.

Thanks, 
Greg Brazaitis

I don't know if you have been keeping up with the recruiting info but Mack 
has committments from 4 blue chippers already.  One of them is the top LB in 
Arizona.  He is working his magic again this year.

Attached for your review in the Gallup Transaction are the following 
documents:

 1.  Assignment and Contribution Agreement - Assignment operational documents 
and rights in assets from ECS into the LLC 
 
 2.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement -  Defines 
relationship between ECS and Enron Engineering and Construction   Company for 
installation of the motor driver at Gallup.  This document will be assigned 
into the LLC except for that portion which relates to the electric power  
transmission line.  The utility will take ownership of the transmission line 
per the power purchase agreement.

Also forwarded via hard copy yesterday, was the executed Power Purchase 
Agreement.  Please let me know if you have not received this yet.  

I will shortly email the form of gas purchase agreement between the LLC and 
ECS.  This will merely be a new Confirm (Transaction Agreement "C") which 
will operate under the existing Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement 
between ECS and the LLC which was created for Kachina.

Concerning the PPA, I did receive it but there was a line missing in the

Hi Katie,   Looks like you got the address right.  I too enjoyed talking with 
you last night.  I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your 
research project for a while.  

Its been a busy week so far.  The end of the yearly quarter always is.  Last 
minute deals have to be closed to book the income.  At this time of year the 
commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says "I have got to get 
this project done or I am out of here".  March 31 can't arrive soon enough.  

Got any big plans for the weekend?  Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is 
that only where rookies hang out?  

Take care and I'll talk to you later.

Gerald  

Katie McMahon <katie99@tamu.edu> on 03/22/2000 12:32:59 PM
Hey Gerald,
 Just checking to see if I got your address right.  I enjoyed talking
with you last night.  Have a great week! :)

Katie

How are things going?  Haven't talked to you in a while.  As for me, I am 
fine.  Work is pretty busy right now.  We are at the end of the quarter and 
have to get certain deals closed before March 31, so it can get hectic.

My roommate will be leaving shortly.  He got a job opportunity with his 
family in North Carolina, so he will be moving.  Didn't last very long, but I 
knew that was a possibility when he moved in.  

Are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with Sharon.  It 
should really be a beautiful wedding up in Estes Park.  Very nice mountain 
scenery.  

Take care and I will talk with you later.

Gerald.

Gentlemen, Yes that means you, Eric.  Please review the attached and give me 
any comments before I distribute to the group.

Amy,  I revised a few things in the agreement.  Should be ready to go.

Susan, Attached is the text I am forwarding to the investors.  Please let me 
know if you have any comments.  Thanks for your help.

I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and 
have the following points;

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 
853-3512. 

Heather, 

 I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and 
have the following points;

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS in 
the filings for the certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't 
ask any further questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance 
Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same 
tasks as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M 
agreements would be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory 
responsibility over the compressor facilities.  The Operational Control 
agreement was put into place in the Gallup Transaction because it was thought 
to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than provide 
them with the Gallup O&M Agreement which might unecessarily complicate the 
certification process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the targeted start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 
853-3512. 

Attached are the following documents with slight changes and all the numbers 
input:
 1.  Amendment to Compressor Services Agreement (Bloomfield)
 2.  Amendment to Compressor Services Agreement (Bisti)
 3.  Amendment to Operation and Maintenance Agreement (Bloomfield)
 4.  Amendment to Operation and Maintenance Agreement (Bisti)

Please disregard the previous versions and focus on these.   Also attached 
are two side letter agreements which specify the net book value for the 
Compressor Motor Buyout provisions (in the event of termination) under the 
Compressor Services Agreements
 5.  Net Book Value Letter for Bloomfield
 6.  Net Book Value Letter for Bisti

Again,  the plan is to have ECT and TW execute these documents and then 
assign all of these along with the agreements they amend and the power 
contracts to the ECS Compression Company, L.L.C.  Your timely review will be 
appreciated.  

Attached is the letter under which TW approved the Power Purchase Agreement.  
I will forward an executed copy as well.

Please review the attached.  I am still waiting on an answer from Davis 
concerning Section 3.2.  It may need to be tweaked a little more.

Hi Katie,  I am feeling good about status of the deals!  Looks like we should 
close next Wednesday.  So as it stands now, I don't think I will have to work 
this weekend.  Of course now that I just said that, it almost positive that 
something will come up.

Hmmm,  Actually work might not be such a bad thing as my alternative is 
helping my roommate pack his stuff up for his move to North Carolina.

Have a great weekend! Talk to you soon.

I'm not really a fan of forwarding this crap, but this one is funny if
you can open & view it.

You have to watch this closely to catch what happens . . . the picture
quality isn't very good . . . but this is funny (at the expense of
someone's pain!).  Ouch!

In the spirit of your previous email, check this one out.

Susan,  Attached is the amendment we discussed.  We would like to execute 
this today.  Mark indicated that Steve would sign today if everything looks 
OK.  Thanks for your help, Susan.

John,  Good to hear from you.  Things are going fine.

There aren't really any parking garages close to the ballpark and getting 
near the ballpark on an open lot will be damn near impossible.  I believe 
metro will be running a shuttle from open lots in downtown which are probably 
about 10 blocks away from the park.  There are several of these lots around 
the Enron building and Smith and Lousiana St.  Might be worth checking the 
either the Metro web site or the Enron Field web site to get exact details on 
the Shuttle routes.  I believe the shuttle will drop off directly in front of 
the park.

I received the Nemec Family Reunion flyer recently.  Looks like your whole 
family got drafted into service this year.  I guess thats a danger of showing 
up at those things.  

Take care and we'll talk to you later.

Hey Gerald how are things going?

I need your expertise...(scary isn't it).

With the baseball season approaching, I am looking for recommendations on
where to park downtown.  Do you know of any parking garages that are
somewhat close and are charging $5-$10?

Please advise.  Thanks!

Thanks,  That does the trick.

Attached for review is the Confirmation (under existing Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase Agreement between ECS and ECC) for the gas received by ECC from TW 
pursuant to the Gas Conversion Agreement.

I haven't heard anything about the status of those recruits, except that it 
sounds like Alfio Randall will be a partial qualifier.  This isn't great 
since we need OL for depth this year. 

Attached is the form of Amendment to the Gas Conversion Agreement that was 
executed by TW on Friday.  The Amendment does the following:

 1.  Shifts gas flow delivery to commence upon the Start Date instead of the 
2 month lag.
 2.  Deems the Start Date for all operational documents with TW to be May 1, 
2000 regardless of when physical start up occurs.

Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 with any questions.  

Attached are Exhibits A to both the Operation and Maintenance Agreement and 
the Contribution and Assignment Agreement - Description of the Assets  

The descriptions of the Assets are duplicate on both Exhibits.     

Attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement between Enron Compression Services 
Note:  In the Kachina deal we used Enron Natural Gas Marketing instead of ENA 
for this gas deal.  After discussions with tax and accounting, there were no 
objections to using ENA in this deal.

Please review.

Ruppert,  Unfortunately it doesn't look like I am going to be able to make it 
due to work.  If things change I will let you know.

Susan, Attached is a description of the Gallup Facilities which should be

information forwarded by Enron Engineering & Construction Company.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks very much for your help and short turnaround on the amendments Friday.

Thanks for the phone message.  Glad you made it safely.   It was fun while it 
lasted.   I received your avalanche of Inside Texas reports.  I will spend 
the afternoon going through those.  Should make for a busy day.

Give me a call when you get settle and let me know how things are going.  
Have you told your parents you want airlines miles or points for name brand 
merchandise during your stay at the house?

Talk to you later and take care.

Janet,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Confidentiality 
Agreement (Trunkline) with the revisions we discussed.  Please review.  Bobby 
Gaspard with Trunkline, asked that I forward the revised draft via email and 
after their review an executable.  Please forward to Bobby for his review at 
bjgaspard@cmsenergy.com if you are okay with this draft.

Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks

Attached is a draft of the EPNG for your review and El Paso's.  Let me know 
when you want executables.

TUFCO has agreed to remove the exception to consequentials for breach of 
quality provisions.  They are preparing executables and will forward to HPL 
for execution.  Thanks for your help.

Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   

Hi Katie,
 How is my favorite Aggie?   Its been a hectic week so far.  This deal is 
scheduled to close Thursday morning and then a I catch a flight to Denver 
Thursday afternoon.  I have been putting the guys off in our Denver office 
for some time so I will be busy with them all day Friday and then a flight 
back to Houston on Saturday.  Denver is a cool town, so it should be fun on 
Friday night.

How is the research project going?  Any major breakthroughs in the health 
area.  Remember me when you win the Nobel Prize!

Gerald  

Attached is a redlined Assignment and Contribution Agreement with changes 
requested by Bracewell & Patterson.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

 

Eric,  Please take a stab at drafting the interconnect agreement.  This is 
Mary Jo's deal.  

Shawna,

Attached is a Contract Preparation Request for a Facilities Agreement for the 
inlet meter to the Hilcorp Old Ocean Processing Plant.  Also attached is a 
copy of the Work Order describing the scope of the project.  This meter will 
be numbered 098-1603.

George x3-6992

	
	

Brad,

In follow up to our meetin with Hilcorp yesterday, I am requesting that you 
break out a segment from the original estimate for facilities. 

We have determined that the immediate need will require is a cost estimate 
for the inlet meter at the intersection of the two pipelines.  Hilcorp will 
put in the tap on their line.  I would like to have a notional number of how 
much that saves us also.

Since the estimate is already complete, I am hoping you can just break out 
this information.  Greg Sharp is looking for an answer of go or no go on this 
project as early as this Friday (the 10th).  

Please let me know if this is possible so that I can run some economics....

Steve,  Those were CPS's suggested changes, not mine.  I agree.  I don't know 
what they want for Section 6 and Jim has agreed to get with CPS to get 
further definition.  I also recommend pulling the language inserted in 
Section 3 as Jim indicated we have already submitted all the estimates.  The 
Bexar county venue is unacceptable and will be stricken.  David Marshall is 
reviewing the insurance section and should have an answer today.

Steve HPL Schneider
03/30/2000 07:51 AM
I have reviewed the changes which you have made.  Under Section 6, I have no 
idea what we would submit.  Therefore I suggest that the additions under this 
section be removed.  The insurance provision looks fine to me except that I 
would like to see a larger umbrella amount, but you need to get David 
Marshall to bless.  Is there a precedent for having Bexar County the point of 
venue under this contract?  Upon your completion, please send 3 copies to me, 
2 of which I will submit for execution to CPS.

Hi Katie,  So far so good.  Busy but moving forward.  It will be interesting 
to see if I catch my flight or if I have to delay it some.  Denver should be 
nice.  I was watching the weather channel and it appears that it will be 
pretty cold up there.  I saw something about lows in the 10-20s.  Yikes!  
You're right though. I enjoy traveling every once in a while for a change of 
pace.  The guys I work with up there are fun, so that makes the work go alot 
easier.  

Take care and talk to you later.
Gerald

Katie McMahon <katie99@tamu.edu> on 03/29/2000 11:40:28 AM
Hey Gerald!
 I'm doing O.K.  How are you?  Mon. and Tues. were busy, but the rest of
the week shouldn't be too bad.  The research project is going well,
except that a lot of the articles we need have to be ordered because our
libraries do not carry the journals.  That's probably typical though.
Tomorrow we have a big meeting with my prof to come up with an outline
for the project, so things should really start falling into place pretty
soon. Starting next Mon. I will be volunteering for the Health-for-all
clinics Health Educator (we have to volunteer for one of my classes).  I
will be helping diabetics and people with high blood pressure plan their
diet and physical activity schedule.  I'm pretty excited, but still need
to read up on nutrition since I am a little rusty.
 Denver, huh?  It will be so beautiful.  I've only been to Colorado once
to ski.  I wasn't too big on the skiing thing, but I did enjoy the
scenery.  You will have a great time.  Do you like that you have to
travel every once in a while for your job?  I would think that it would
be nice to get out of Houston every once in a while.
 Did it rain in Houston last night?  THere was a huge thunderstorm here
around 4:30a.m.  It almost sounded like it was hailing for a minute, but
I don't think it did.  I heard Ft. Worth got it pretty badly.  Three
people were confirmed dead today.  On a lighter note, have fun on your
trip!

 I'm not so sure about the Nobel Prize thing, but hey... it would be
nice.

Take care,
Katie

Report, 3/27/00

Hi Katie,  Yes I am back in town.  Sorry I wasn't able to return your email 
yesterday.  It has just been crazy around here and I am leaving for San 
Antonio tommorrow and will be out the rest of the week for the Enron Legal 
Conference.  It is going to be at La Cantera on the northwest side of SA.  
The place sounds pretty relaxing, so it should be fun.  Back in Houston 
Friday late.  

Yea Denver was nice.  Slight delay in the flight, but not due to weather.  
Just the usual airline misadventures.  It was snowing pretty hard when I 
arrived.  Kinda nice to be around some actual cold weather for a change.  
Worked all day Friday and stayed with some friends Sat. night.    Wish I had 
time to go up to the mountains for skiing.  So your not big on skiing huh?  
The first time I went I hated it, but as you get better it really becomes a 
lot of fun.  Last time I went (last March) I tried snowboarding.  It was a 
lot of work to learn a new snow sport.  It was cool after I got the hang of 
it, except for dislocating my shoulder.  Ouch! 

Sounds like ya'll had a good time at Northgate.  I hate it when friends take 
you out and get you drunk.  That seems to happen to me occasionally.  OK more 
than occasionally.  

This time change does make for a rough week.  I didn't wake up until 8:00 am 
for work on Monday.  Just a little later for work than usual. 

Coming into Houston anytime soon?  If you get a chance, I'd really like to 
take you to dinner sometime.  Take care.  Bye!

Gerald  

I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed 
at the meeting previously.  

Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party 
obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, 
if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 

Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone 
tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

Jim Schwieger
04/03/2000 05:00 PM
Sounds good to me!   Let's get it done!

 Thanks,   Swig

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to 
complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now 
against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in 
unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW 
for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the 
facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Have you reached an agreement within your shop about the location of the
second
interconnect between the two companies?

Jim,  It is in the attached string of emails.  The 5th one down.

unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW 
for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the 
facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Have you reached an agreement within your shop about the location of the
second
interconnect between the two companies?

gerald,  we are talking to oakhill pipeline lp about providing a proposal to 
them to install an electric motor to increase their capacity at their Hinkle 
Compressor Station in Rusk County, Texas.

The CA should be 2 way and the information is as follows:

Attached for review are the clean and redlined versions of the new Field 
Services and Gas Purchase Agreements.  Also attached is a Termination 
agreement which terminates the existing agreements with Kennedy.  Please 
review.  

Dan,  Please make sure the Purchase Agreement pricing is accurate.  
Independant will follow tommorrow.

Attached is the amendment to the field services agreement and a new 
construction agreement for the incremental collection facilities.

Independant needs to prepare Exhibit A to the construction agreement.  This 
is a description of the facilities to be constructed.  The construction 
agreement is the exact form which was executed for the initial Collection 
Facilities.  Please review and if everthing looks acceptable, please forward 
to Independant.

Kay,  Please see attached.

Attached are the draft Confidentiality Agreements for the Colonial Pipeline 
Projects.

Please note the following:

 1.  Need address, contact, full legal name information for Flowserve.
 2.  Please review the scope (1st Paragraph) for both agreements.  Need to 
make sure I not giving the parties to little or too much information 
concerning  each others roles in this project.
 3.  The Flowserve CA is unilateral.  Only binds Flowserve to protect info we 
give them.

Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Here they are.

11:30 Sounds fine.  Meet you downstairs.

Janel Guerrero@ENRON
04/11/2000 08:18 AM
Do you mind meeting at 11:30 for lunch today?  I've got a 1:00 meeting I need 
to get back for.  I can meet you by the revolving glass doors downstairs if 
we're still on.  

Bruce,  How is it going?  Are you still having problems working in your 
room?  Its like psssst, I am out.  

I have a couple of letters at the house for you.  I can forward wherever you 
like.  Things are going fine for me.  I cry myself to sleep every night 
screaming out Bruce, Bruce why did you leave me?

Drop me a line and let me know how it is going.  Also do you have Tristan's 
phone number?  Wanted to give him a call and see if he wanted to grab some 
beers now and then.

Attached are the revised agreements based on our discussion prior.  Please 
review and if everything  looks good, I will prepare executables for MidCon.
Please note the following revisions:

 1.  Midcon installs, owns, and operates the Deer Park Interconnect. 
 2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
 3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, 
the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
 4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.

Please call if you have any questions.  x-33512.

Patti,   Hope everthing finds you well.  Just wanted to check if you had 
executed the interest rate swap and returned the documents yet.  Trying to 
clean up and prepare a binder of all documents.  Thanks.

John,  Attached are the case historys for the two cases.  Note:

Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited
Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only 
(not really relevant)
Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found 
that the facts of the two cases were different.

Hope this helps.

Carol,  I am interested in joining in on a group gift.  Let me know what you 
need.  

Tom, I would like to attend lunch.

   

Chairman Garza's visit to Houston will be on June 23, but it may be at 
another downtown company (perhaps Exxon?) instead of Enron.  If you want to 
attend the "tour" and/or the lunch, let me know ASAP.

 The Pipeline Joint Defense Group/TECALA, of which HPL is a member, has 
invited Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Tony Garza to come to Houston to 
meet with the group.   I have tentatively offered to include as part of the 
meeting a tour of the Enron Gas Control Room (can you do that, James?) for 
Chairman Garza and a small number of people from the Group (maybe about a 
dozen).  We would like a larger number of representatives from companies 
which are members of the Group to attend the general informal discussion with 
Chairman Garza, probably at either the Enron Building, The Met, or otherwise 
nearby.  Tentative dates are June 23 and June 30, probably in the middle of 
the day with lunch.
 Please let me know whether or not you would like to attend the meeting, and 
if so what date(s) work for you, and I will pass the information on to Roxann 
Neumann, who is coordinating the meeting.  If you think any others would like 
to attend, give me a call (36417) or cc:mail.

I put in a call this morning to discuss.  Left a voicemail.  I will let you 
know what develops.  Thanks.

Gerald,

 Did you ever talk to Trunkline's attorney (Merlin Remmenger @ 713.989.7560) 
about the changes that they wanted in the "Exclusive Negotiations" clause.

Thanks,
Janet

Attached is the form of confidentiality agreement for the Colonial project.  
Per Mark Knippa's request I am forwarding for your review.  

Hi Katie,
 That email was pretty true.  School can be extremely stressful in short 
periods (around finals) but overall compared to work it was really a pretty 
easy lifestyle.  How are thing's going for you with school?  Sounded like 
this month was going to be a busy one.  The good thing about school is that 
there is a definite ending point with a break between.  
 It has calmed down some around here.  Focusing on things that I had dropped 
during the end of quarter stretch.  I bought a new guitar yesterday.  My 
friend Eric and I had our eye on this black Fernandes model for some time and 
yesterday we decided to go for it.  I am still in the learning stages of 
playing but it won't be too long before fame and stardom are at my disposal.  
Well maybe a little longer than that.  Playing is really fun and a good 
stress reliever though. 

Hope everthing is going well for you. 

Take care,  
Gerald 

Kay, Please review the attached.

What's going on Tree?  Bruce forwarded me your email address, probably 
against your wishes.  Just thought I'd drop a line and see if your up for 
beers sometime this weekend.  I know its tough to fit anytime in between 
those dates with the lovely fake breasted super models, but let's try and 
hook up sometime. 

Per Jaime Ginsberg's request I am forward our form of Confidentiality 
Agreement for your review.  

Per Jaime Ginsberg's request, I am forwarding our form of Confidentiality 
Agreement for your review.

Clement,  Attached is a form of guaranty by Enron Corp. for ECS Compression 
Services Company, LLC.  (ECC).  ECC is owned approximately 9% by Enron 
Compression Services Company (a 100% owned ENA subsidiary).  The form has 
been reviewed by Continental Divide Electric Cooperative, Inc. (the 
Counterparty) and they are OK with it.  Please review and let me know if you 
have any questions.  If everything looks good, please obtain execution.

Thanks for your help.

Mike.  Generally the language is fine, but I tweaked to make sure it is 
clearer.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

FYI.  Here is the email from La Joie du Vin concerning other wine 
appreciation groups.

Since our last email described the closing of La Joie du Vin, we have been
asked a number of times about the existence of any other, similar groups
dedicated to enjoying and learning about wine.  The Wine Society of Texas is
just such a group.  They have extended an invitation to our members and
friends to learn about their organization and participate, either as guests
at events or in an organizational capacity.  We encourage you to take a
moment to read to following introduction and consider supporting and
participating in The Wine Society of Texas.  Their mission and goals are
admirable and we all, as wine lovers, will benefit as those goals are
realized.

Sincerely,

Greg Giordano

From  Dr. R.D. Kane, Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President, Wine Society
of Texas

Greg,

Per our telephone conversation today, I would like to forward this
 message to you and the members in your organization. As we
 discussed, the Wine Society of Texas is a statewide 501(c)3
 educational organization with approximately 350 members in Texas
 and about 120 in Houston. We also have chapters in Austin, San
 Antonio and two in the DFW area. Our mission statement
 (paraphrased and shortened) is to help develop a wine educated
 consummer base in Texas and to support charitable organizations
 and responsible consumption. Unfortunately, some people confuse
 this message with only working with or interest in Texas wines. But,
 this is far from the truth.

 The WST has been working to provide education on wine tasting,
 wine making and grape growing in a pleasant social setting. The link
 to the local wine industry has been a great asset that has helped
 provide first hand experiences in grape growing and wine making.
 Personally, I have picked and crushed and this has given me have a
 much better appreciation for this part of the process everytime I
 down a glass of wine. However, we have also been trying develop an
 awareness in Texas regarding the benchmarks in fine wines, so that
 consummers increase their knowledge of fine wines from around the
 world.

 This latter point is one that is illustrated in our upcoming event,
 Springfest 2000, on March 24-26. The festival event will be held in
 Old Town Spring Texas and the premium events (Vintner Dinner and
 Grand Tasting) will be held at the Hotel Sofitel near Bush IAH.  We
 will have specialists in grape growing and wine making talking about
 new varietals in Texas, some of which have their "roots" in other
 similar regions of the world such as those from Rhone, Spain and
 Italy. We also the Art Institute Culinary School their to give wine and
 food preparation demos. Our Vintner Dinner (Fri. 3/24) will feature a
 special pairing of wines from Texas and France featuring
 Chardonnay and Rhone Blends.  At the Grand Tasting and Media
 Choice Awards Presentations, (Sat. 3/25) the attendees will be
 tasting the best of the wine submitted for judging and vote for their
 favorites. Springfest is a charity event that is raising funds for the
 American Heart Assocition, the Old Town Spring Preservation
 League and the Wine Society of Texas Scholarship Fund. More
 details are available at:

 http://www.winesocietyoftexas.org/houston/

I welcome you and your members to
 check out the WST and Springest 2000. If you have any questions,
or would like more information, please contact me.

Regards,

Dr. R.D. Kane
Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President
Wine Society of Texas

Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your law
degree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like you
are really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like
fun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,
they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I got
back from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'l
spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship in
the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm getting
pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two
years.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born
4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate
is too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.
Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.
My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.
When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is working
semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing
boats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers for
surfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is the
biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library
science and information technology.  He did really well and now has a job
with Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computer
geeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we can
work in a visit.  Possibly after March next year unless you're out in San
Diego while Im in the Gulf and you can look Michele up.  Keep in touch and
well work something out.  Take care Gerald.  Paul.

Kay,  Could you please send me a copy of the CA.  Thanks.

Gerald:  Sorry for the delay on these.  I thought I had responded, but don't 
find a "Sent mail".  We have nothing relating to Horizon.  There is an 
executed agreement with Merrill Lynch re financing for Trailblazer Pipeline 
Company, but nothing with Trailblazer.  I'll put the datasheet in your box.  
Let me know if you need to see the agreement.

Kay, Please review the attached.

The construction agreement with the date information we discussed.  

Sounds like you are running and gunning.  I know how those times feel.  Seems 
like it is never going to end.   You have been through it enough times to 
know that it always does.  I don't think there is any feeling like turning in 
that last paper or walking out of that last final at the end of a semester.  
Feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  After that comes 
lifting the huge mug filled with beer.

Hang in there.
Gerald

Katie McMahon <katie99@tamu.edu> on 04/16/2000 07:53:35 PM
Hey Gerald,
 Sorry I've taken a while to write back.  I've been really busy with my
research paper.  It's due on Tues. along with another paper.  I also
have a presentation on Thurs. and one on next Tues.  After that it's
take home final time and then I am done.  I can see the light at the end
of the road!  It feels like a long way until I get there though.
 So, you are learning guitar?  THat's pretty cool.  I used to play the
trumpet.  I miss it every once in a while.
 Well, I hope you have a good week.
Talk to you later,
Katie

I lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail.  
Could you be so kind as to resend via email.  I am thinking of just taking a 
poll to see what everyone's interest are.  I personally am thinking Mountain 
Biking sounds like great fun and a super way to endanger my life.  Drop me a 
note when you get a chance.  Also what is the schedule for the get together 
on Sat. 

Bruce,  Attached is an article I found in the Houston Chronicle business 
section yesterday.  Has a negative outlook, but mostly related to product 
supply B2Bs.    You probably are familiar with most of the B2Bs they 
mention.  Thought might be useful to you.  Good talking to you yesterday.  
The check better arrive this week or I start breaking your stuff one piece at 
a time.

Attached is the master form with the quality language revised.  Please use 
this form from this point forward.

Hi Wayne,  Thanks for the email.  Things are going fine here in Houston.  
Unfortunately this weekend is going to be a bad one for me.  I have to work 
Friday and have plans already for Saturday.  Some other time would probably 
work better.  Let me know what your schedule looks like and we can work 
something out.  Hope things are going well for you in Austin.  Drop me a line 
when you get a chance.

Gerald

Hey, Gerald how is your day? I am off friday for Good Friday and thought I
would come to Houston for the weekend to see how things are going. If this
is a bad time for you you call me and I will come some other time. My number

Katie,  Glad I cheered you up.  Believe me, I can relate.  I could tell you 
horror stories about when I was studying for the bar exam.  I'll save those 
for some other time.  

Hope all is going well and moving forward.  What always kept me going was the 
idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and I wanted to be 
able to look back and feel that I had given the best effort I could.  That's 
all you can do.  It is typically more than enough to do very well in grades.  
I will quit preaching now and let you get back to work.  

No big plans for the Easter Weekend.  Will be here in Houston.  I actually 
have to work on Friday, but am thinking about taking a vacation day.  Sounds 
like you will probably be busy with school and family over your weekend in 
Katy, but give me a call if you feel like it.  Maybe we can do something fun.

Ron,  Couple of comments.  
 1.  Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.  The 
name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer 
Pipeline  Company, L.P.)  Also for an LP the General Partner will need to 
sign to make it binding.  The signature block should read as follows:

  Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.
   by its General Partner, _________________________

Gerald,

As agreed, I think that we need to send Midcon first two pages of cost 
estimate to cut down on questions.  Attached is the file.  Call with 
questions.

Thanks,

Rodney 

Becky,  Not sure if anyone in Denver is on the distribution list.  If not 
Scott Sitter in Denver probably needs a copy of these docs.  Might want to 
check with him and see if anyone else in Denver needs a copy.

   

Regarding documents that I have had recorded in Campbell County, Wyoming, we 
are now ready to send the originals to the file room.  Are there any other 
originals that need to go with them?  Are there any other persons who may 
need a copy of the recorded document(s)?

Kim Bennick takes care of the distribution of our recorded originals after I 
have finished having them recorded.  Please let Kim know if these Wyoming 
documents should be treated differently than our normal Houston Pipe Line 
recordings.

Thanks!

Mom,  Could you send me a list of eveyone's email address.  What to take a 
poll on activities in Estes that everyone might be interested in.

I am doing fine.  Hope you guys are doing well.

Clement,  I had sent you a draft of a guaranty by Enron Corp. for ECS 
Compression Company, L.L.C. earlier.  Have you had a chance to review and 
obtain execution yet.  Please let me know the status.  Thanks for your help

Ron,  Couple of comments.  
 1.  Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.  The 
name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer 
Pipeline  Company, L.P.)  Also for an LP the General Partner will need to 
sign to make it binding.  The signature block should read as follows:

  Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.
   by its General Partner, _________________________

 2.  The limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this

Attached for your review and discussion at the transport review meeting this 
Thursday are the following:

 1.  Revised Goals for Interruptible Contract Revision Process
 2.  Flow Chart of Current Interruptible Transport documentation Process

These items will be revised as we work through the processs.

Brad,  Attached is your form of lease with my comments incorporated.  Please 
note that I have added Mariner Energy, Inc. as a Party to the agreement since 
Mariner is performing all operations and maintenance for the facilities owned 
by MEGS.  

Please note the Mariner also will need to review and comment on  this 
document and I am forwarding it to them concurrently.  

Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 with questions.

Greg,  Attached is the document we discussed.  Please review.  Mariner is a 
party to this agreement since Mariner is performing all operations and 
maintence functions for the MEGS assets and this is consistent with the 
Operation and Maintance Agreement between Mariner and MEGS.  Please call me

Hi Katie,  How are you doing?  Did you survive all your projects and 
presentations?  Haven't heard from you in a while and just wanted to see if 
you made it through.  Hope everything is going OK.  

Gerald

FYI.  I think there was a temp here the day I sent this letter out.

I received my copy of ECS's April 13 letter to TW and noticed it was 
addressed to the wrong Susan Scott.  She usually does forward me the mail she 
receives by mistake.  But since the information that we occasionally send 
each other thru interoffice mail for these compressor deals is more important 
than most, I thought I'd let you know my correct room # is 4788.  Also, when 
sending e-mail make sure you address it to Susan Scott at ET&S, not ECT.  
This will ensure I receive everything you send me.  Thanks!

Per your request.  Enjoy.

Sorry,  Sent you the wrong one last time.  I will try it again

Lost my number eh?   A likely story.  Just kidding.  Sounds like you were 
pretty busy with family.  I had a pretty good Easter as well.  Mostly just 
hung out with friends and enjoyed the weather.  Of course I worked in a 
little jam session with my friends.  

The week is going pretty well.  Been in a lot of meetings and those just suck 
up the time.  I am leaving today at lunch to go to Enron Field.  The Cubs are 
in town and it is an afternoon game.  Should be fun.  The Astros really stink 
this year but the field is pretty awesome.  I am not a huge baseball fan and 
but outdoor baseball in Houston is pretty cool.

Good luck on the remainder of your schoolwork.  My numbers are:

Take care,
Gerald

How wierd!
 I just logged on and was about to e-mail you.  We must be on the same
wave length or something.
 Yes, I survived.  I have a take home final due next Tues. and a 1 page
abstract due tomorrow, but that is it!
 I went home this weekend for Easter and was going to call you to see
how you were doing.  I could not find your # though anywhere.  I know
you gave it to me once, but I don't know what I did with it.  What is
your #?  Did you have a good Easter.  It ends up that I wouldn't have
been able to see you.  I came in late Fri. night, spent all day Sat.
doing yard work, went out with my dad and sisters Sat. night, and spent
time with the family on Sun.  Just wanted to let you know that I am not
trying to avoid you.
 How is your week going?  My dad asked about you this weekend.  I told
him we were still e-mailing each other.  He seems to like you.

Have a good day,
Katie

I was told that we have received these back from Southern Union, but I don't 
remember who told me.  Should they have come back to Steve?

Roger,  Attached is the form we discussed.  

Andy,  Attached is the complete contract.  

Hope things are going well for you.  We should have lunch some time.  Have 
any availability next week?

Cris,  For the sake of completeness, attached is the form of gas purchase 
agreement and confirm with the $10 million prepayment between ECC and ECS.  
The pricing has not been input yet.  

The gas purchase agreement between ECS and ECT would be a mirror of this one.

Andy,  Attached is the complete contract.  

Hope things are going well for you.  We should have lunch some time.  Have 
any availability next week?

Mark,    I received your fax concerning the season tickets.  Thanks for quick 
response.  I thought given the short time frame I would just email with my 
information.

If I could get 2 season tickets in my name on the East Side Lower Deck toward 
the Neuhaus Athletic Center, that would be my preference.  Lisa, indicated 
you wouldn't be able to know what seats might be available until you got all 
the responses back.  If you could email with the seats you have available 
prior to charging my credit card, I would greatly appreciate it.

If the only seats you have would be worse than about the 15 yard line in the 
area I mentioned above, I have a friend who is a Longhorn Foundation member 
with 6 tickets in that area at about the 15 yard line.  His name is Patrick 
McDonald.  If possible that I could attach 2 more season tickets to his 
without affecting the location of his seats, that would be great also.

I don't need OU tix.

My credit card number is 4305 7216 5689 6359  Expires 2/28/02  Visa.  If you 
really need the form filled out, just let me know and I will forward it.

Thanks for your help.

Why am I being used as a bargaining piece in this saga?  The thing that 
really scares me, is if I show up I am sure I will be selected to be on next 
years Family Reunion Committee.  Hmmm.

Okay, I guess I can make the sacrifice.  I believe I will have a 3 day 
weekend at that time.  Should work out.  I think the cocktail party on June 
23 will work out.  I have got a lot of things going on right now that would 
make it tough to get away right now for the 13th.

Talked to Mom about the flyfishing.  Sounds like they aren't sure what they 
really want to do.  They are supposed to get back to me.  You know Mom,  
avoid the things that intimidate you.  

Anyway,  hope everything is going well for you and with the wedding plans.  
Talk to you later.

Sharon Nemec <snemec@shelton.org> on 05/02/2000 09:26:18 AM
Will has made the statement that he will only go if you go.  I know that is
a lot of pressure, but will you please come to the reunion?  We can drink
and polka to the oldies.  I want Will to get a taste of our past and feel
sorry for me.  So are you in?

How are the family plans for the wedding going? Are they driving you crazy?
Also, can you come to the BBQ on the 13 or the cocktail party on June 23.
Mom and Dad are coming for the BBQ.  If you want, come up then.  I want to
see you soon.  Love ya!!

Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.  

Ron,  As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.  
Please note the following points:

1.  Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
Utility?

Please review with these in mind.  I will be out tommorrow and Friday.  Let's 
plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.  

Are you moving floors or just moving around on 31?  I don't want a lump of 
coal from you at Christmas.

Janel Guerrero@ENRON
05/03/2000 04:03 PM
Well, it looks like I'm headed over to the coal group.  They called me up 
after lunch and it's all just a matter of time.  (I actually think the coal 
group cares more about emissions than power, so this might be better after 
all).  Anyway, it appears pretty close to being a done deal.  Barring any 
unforseen glitches, I should be up there in the next week or so.  

Have fun in Mexico!  

Katie,  Are you still out there?  I tried to email you a couple of times last 
week, but they wouldn't go through for some reason.

fyi

Shawna,

Attached is a Contract Preparation Request for a Facilities Agreement for the 
inlet meter to the Hilcorp Old Ocean Processing Plant.  Also attached is a 
copy of the Work Order describing the scope of the project.  This meter will 
be numbered 098-1603.

George x3-6992

	
	

Brad,

In follow up to our meetin with Hilcorp yesterday, I am requesting that you 
break out a segment from the original estimate for facilities. 

We have determined that the immediate need will require is a cost estimate 
for the inlet meter at the intersection of the two pipelines.  Hilcorp will 
put in the tap on their line.  I would like to have a notional number of how 
much that saves us also.

Since the estimate is already complete, I am hoping you can just break out 
this information.  Greg Sharp is looking for an answer of go or no go on this 
project as early as this Friday (the 10th).  

Please let me know if this is possible so that I can run some economics....

Thanks for your help.

I am doing good.  I was out for 4 days (Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun) of last week.  
Just got back from Mexico.  Playa del Carmen, which is about 45 minutes south 
of Cancun.    Sun, beach, drinks, party and scuba (Not necessarily in that 
order).  It doesn't get any better than that.  Had a great time.

Congrats on 23!  Yes, you are still very young and don't let anybody tell you 
otherwise.  When you join the business world, you will be fighting the image 
that you are too young to be taken seriously.

Dunk the ring tradition?  You have peaked my curiosity!  You will have to 
give me the full rundown on exactly how wild that tradition is.  

Are you moving back to Katy for the summer?  What are your plans?  School, 
work, etc.  

Take care and talk to you later.

Gerald,   

Katie McMahon <katie99@tamu.edu> on 05/08/2000 02:44:53 PM
Yea, I figured that is what had happened.  My e-mail was full and
bounced back a lot of messages.  It's up and running now, however.  How
are you doing?  It sure is hot outside.

I'm 23 now!  Whoppee!  People around here think that I am an oldie.  I
tell them that I may be old in school, but young in the business world.

How was your weekend?  Mine went well.  A friend from Houston came and
visited me on Fri.  We went to the Chicken to watch a friend dunk here
ring.  Are you familiar with that tradition?  It's a wild one that I
have to admit I participated in myself.

Good day,
Katie

Mark,  Attached is the supplement to the Gas Letter for your review.  Do you 
have Patti's email.  We need to forward this for her review as well.

Patti,
Attached for your review is a draft supplement to the Gas Price Letter which 
increases the gas that TW delivers to the LLC by 2585 mmbtu per month.  We 
need to move forward and have TW execute ASAP to capture existing gas 
pricing, therefore I am only forwarding this document for your review at this 
time.  There will be more to follow.  Please contact myself at (713) 853-3512 
or Mark Knippa at (713) 853-3463 with any questions.  Thank You.

Cynthia,  Sorry about the way I left last night, but I needed to leave 
abruptly or I felt I would have lost it even more.  You are right.  This is a 
very difficult time in my life.  However, I want you to know that you are a 
very special person to me.  The more I get to know you the more I realize 
that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it 
off so well so very quickly.  

I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you, but 
right now there is just too much anger, mistrust, and hurt in my emotions to 
allow that.  All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close 
with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have 
imagined.  These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you 
likely don't understand it all fully.  I am not sure I understand it fully.

I fear I am making a big mistake, because I know you won't be available 
long.  You have so much to offer, beautiful, intelligent, funny, and someone 
who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship.  All 
of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we 
orginally met.  When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions, I 
freaked out  because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to 
realize that I would hurt you.  So I completely pulled back, thinking I 
should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future.  Believe me, it 
is not easy to stay away from you, because even though we have only known 
each other a short time, I miss you and think about you a lot.  It would be 
hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would 
react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night.  My kidding you 
about Lee, I will have to admit, also shows my insecurity about that.

Mexico was so wonderful, because (except for that one night) I was able to 
put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you.  I think that 
is why we had such a great time.  Cynthia, when we were together on that 
trip, I felt a lightness that I haven't felt in a long time.  You looked so 
beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar, and it was all about us and 
nothing else.  I have been through it enough to know that reality of my 
situation creeps back eventually.     

Cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note I feel 
like crying.  Sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like 
a cruel joke.  I think the timing of our meeting was ill fated.  I know we 
will talk to and see each other again but I know it will be different now.  
As much as I want to hold on to you, I know its stupid to attempt to keep you 
close and yet at some distance.  You have are too smart and have too much to 
offer to put up with that.

Please know that I do have genuine feelings for you and I miss you.
Gerald  

Susan, Attached is the supplement to the gas letter which increases the 
amount of gas TW delivers to the LLC. Please review and let me know.

I am impressed!  Anybody who can drink a pitcher of beer that fast is OK in 
my book.  I hope you didn't operate any heavy machinery afterwards.  I guess 
you won't be at this email address for awhile.  Keep in touch and give me 
call if you get a chance when you settle down in Katy.  Bye!

Attached is the agreement with my changes and comments included.  I couldn't 
get it to redline for some reason.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the info.

Dear Gerald:  

Today I received information indicating that effective April 28, 2000, Enron 
Compression Services Company received authorization to do business in Iowa.

I've put the relevant documentation in the file.

I am interested in becoming a member of the Foundation.

set it up?  Thanks

Hi Katie,

Hope everything goes well with the move and UofH.  San Francisco is an 
awesome town.  Make sure you take some warm clothes as it does get chilly 
there year round.  I would live there in a heartbeat if it didn't cost a 
small fortune to do so.  I especially love going up to Napa.  Napa is so 
beautiful and relaxing and the free wine tastings make for a good time also.  

Have fun and talk to you later

up there for a few weeks.  My # in the fall will be 979-847-0011 I
believe.  I've got to check on that one.

You are going to kill me, but I need your phone # again.  It's a long
story, but when my e-mail was full and I was going through deleting
stuff, I think I accidentally deleted your #.  Can I please have it
again?

Hi.  Will you send me "Movieline Dave's" email address?  I'm trying to put 
together a happy hour for next week and I want to include him so he and Lara 
can meet.  (Although I don't think the two of them are really going to dig 
each other very much).  Oh well, it's a good excuse to drink.  

thanks.

Ken,  Can you email me the particulars on Ted so we can put a consulting 
agreement into place with him.  I need the following information:

Full Name
Address
Pay rate (Hourly/Daily+Expenses?)
  
I think that's all for now.  Thanks.

Susan,  Attached is the letter with slight revisions I mentioned on your 
phone mail.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is my changes redlined against your latest version.

Mark,  I joined the foundation today and should be in the system.  Let me 
know if there is anything else you need.  

Thanks for your help.

Movie sounds pretty cool.  When is the official release date?

Coens hit most notes in ``Brother''
O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Southern comedy-drama, color, PG-13, 1:46) 
By Todd McCarthy, Daily Variety Chief Film Critic 
CANNES (Variety) - A musically tinged riff on ``The Odyssey'' set in the 
Depression-era Deep South, ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' is a charming, if 
lightweight, Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and 
performance grace notes. 
Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more 
memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial 
cumulative impact, which will likely translate into just OK box office 
results come domestic release in the fall. 

While the film's epigraph and inspiration come from Homer, its title derives 
from Preston Sturges' film-biz classic ``Sullivan's Travels,'' in which the 
successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a 
socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called ``O Brother, Where 
Art Thou?'' Despite appropriating the handle, the Coens aren't about to fall 
into the trap of pretentiousness themselves, crafting instead a seriocomedy 
that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good 
bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality. 
Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship, 
the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals, with the leader, 
Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), telling his cronies Pete (John 
Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) that he knows where $1.2 million is 
buried. The first person they encounter, however, a blind black man driving a 
railway handcar, warns them that they will find treasure out there, but not 
the treasure they're seeking. 
A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for 
his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology (''It's a fool who looks 
for logic in the chambers of the human heart,'' he advises), Everett stands 
by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism. Picking 
up a young black musician, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), on the road, 
the fellows wander into an isolated radio station/recording studio and, 
posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys, cut a lively tune and are 
paid a few bills for their efforts. They then take off again and remain 
oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit. 
One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the 
lushly verdant landscapes, which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in 
slightly washed-out and burnished hues that are a constant delight. They hook 
up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson (a 
wonderfully live-wired Michael Badalucco), who hates his nickname, Babyface, 
and goes into a huge post-crime funk. 
In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of 
visuals, performance and music, the boys come upon three ``sirens'' who 
seduce them in a watery glade; when Pete disappears thereafter, the dense 
Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad, which he 
proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory one-eyed salesman for 
the word of God (a Cyclops-like John Goodman) squeezes the critter to death 
while beating the other two silly. 
Pete eventually turns up again, only to become perturbed when Everett reveals 
that his real goal, rather than the nonexistent treasure, is to reunite with 
the mother of his seven daughters, Penny (Holly Hunter), who is about to 
marry another fellow. In the course of things, the errant adventurers brush 
up against local politics, a governor's race that pits old incumbent Pappy 
O'Daniel (Charles Durning) against a reform candidate whose motto, ``Friend 
of the Little Man,'' is literally represented by a broom-toting dwarf who 
accompanies him at every campaign stop. 
After slipping in a quiet homage to ``Sullivan's Travels'' in which members 
of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a ``picture show,'' the 
Coens deliver one of their major set pieces, a stupendously choreographed Ku 
Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes 
the invasion of the Wicked Witch's castle by Dorothy's friends in ``The 
Wizard of Oz'' Raucous, the-devil-gets-his-due musical climax is fun (and 
given a big charge by Durning in a splendid, performance-capping turn), but 
is also rather too fairy-tale-ish and too-good-to-be-true to truly satisfy, 
leaving this an ``Odyssey'' without full closure. 
Lack of irony and complexity in the wrap-up may be a shortcoming, but it also 
points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the film's 
portrait of dimwits, con men, rednecks and country folk. Most of the 
characters, including the three leads, may be dumb, misguided and delusional, 
but they are also engaging and straightforward, to be enjoyed for the 
colorful oddballs that they are. 
Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery, 
Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everett's vanity and in delivering 
the Coens' carefully calibrated, high-toned dialogue. Turturro and Nelson (a 
character actor who directed the 1997 indie ``Eye of God'' and the upcoming 
``Othello'' update ``O'') are a real dumb-and-dumber combo without veering 
into slapstick, while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness, 
from Durning and well-known regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root 
as the blind recording entrepreneur, musician King as the boys' sometime 
collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the 
escapees to the bitter end. 
Not as elaborate as ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' or ``The Big Lebowski'' pic is 
nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins' splendid camerawork 
blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassner's evocative production design, Mary 
Zophres' imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are 
all but imperceptible as such (watch for that cow). Delta blues music, a 
combo of T Bone Burnett and pre-existing tunes, is another major plus.

Gerald:

All the following are working documents since we have no executed agreement 
with LIPA or any other entity at this stage.

Here is the LD information from the PPA: 

Here's the force majeure section:

Here's our initial permit working document parts of which may be directed to 
EE&CC. For now assume the entire list is our responsibility.

Here's an initial cut at scope and a draft materials list:

  

Utility coordination is a bit of a mixed bag because we have to work with 
LIPA on transmission issues and KeySpan on site access and demineralized 
water supply issues. KeySpan is also LIPA's contractor for transmission 
operations. We are hoping to structure a management services agreement with 
KeySpan where they would provide mooring space, interconnections for water 
and power as well as operation and maintenance services.

Let me know what else you need. I'll keep you updated as we move closer to 
agreement with LIPA/KeySpan.

Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.  

Ron,  As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.  
Please note the following points:

1.  Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
Utility?

Please review with these in mind.  I will be out tommorrow and Friday.  Let's 
plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.  

I will get something to you within the next couple of days.  Should be a 
straightforward letter agreement.  

Eric,  Let's discuss in the morning.

Please advise as to the status of the agreement I requested you draft for 
me.  Specifically, I seek a reimbursement agreement with HPL as payee and ENA 
as payor whereby HPL will be kept whole on its costs to install the Lockhart 
meter for Southern Union.  We are currently awaiting the final word from El 
Paso to determine if they elect to participate in this meter as is allowed 
them under the JV Agreement., so the reimbursement amount will either be 
HPL's full share of $44,000 or half of that amount, as you know from the 
Lockhart Agreement in which you participated.

Please let me know where you are on this.

Thanks, Gerald!

		Big 12 leads recruiting charge	
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Bill Hodge
FANSonly.com

Dominating the 1999-2000 college basketball recruiting season, the Big 12 has 
five teams in the top 15 men's classes following the late signing period. 
	
	

	
	
	Search for signings 
	
	The spring signing period ran from April 12 to May 15. Use FANSonly.com's 
databases to find all the signings for your favorite school. 
	Men's database search 
	Women's database search. 
	
	Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas, Missouri and Iowa State all had outstanding 
recruiting campaigns. 
	Overall results are pending as signed scholarships continue to arrive 
following the final signing day on May 15. Financial aid agreements (binding 
schools, but not athletes) may still be signed. Eligibility problems are 
common and will affect final rankings as well. 
	Iowa, Indiana and Michigan State head up the top of the Big Ten, while 
Connecticut, Seton Hall and St. John's collected impressive classes in the 
Big East. North Carolina headed the ACC and Cincinnati topped Conference-USA, 
while Memphis, under new head coach John Calipari, finished strong. Alabama 
leads the SEC. 
	If you're looking for pure size, 7-foot-6 center Neil Fingleton, a native of 
England who attended Worchester-Holy Name Central Catholic, Mass., signed 
with North Carolina. Curtis Johnson, a 7-4 center from Norfolk-Ryan Academy, 
Va., is set for St. John's. However, neither will play early roles. 
	1. Connecticut
F Caron Butler,6-7, Pittsfield-Maine Central Institute, Maine
G Taliek Brown, 6-1, Astoria-St. John's Prep, N.Y.
F Scott Hazelton, 6-8, Lawrence-Central Catholic, Mass.
F Johnnie Selvie, 6-7, Flint, Mich/Southeastern CC, Iowa
G Robert Swain, 6-4, College Park-Tri-Cities, Ga. 
	The Huskies have an outstanding class, adding a top junior college player in 
Selvie, plus Swain during the spring. Coach Jim Calhoun had to worry about 
signing Butler, the top prep school prospect in the nation, at the last 
minute over UNLV. Brown and Hazelton are both McDonald's All-Americans and 
potential stars, but all attempts by the UConn staff of signing a big man 
failed. Brown is physical and a scorer. Hazleton is a smooth wing player. 
	2. Seton Hall
F Eddie Griffin, 6-8, Philadelphia-Roman Catholic, Pa.
G Andre Barrett, 5-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y.
G Marcus Toney-El, 6-6, West Orange-Seton Hall Prep, N.J.
F Damion Fray, 6-8, Huntington Station-Whitman, N.Y. 
	Coach Tommy Amaker has this program on the way up and added three Top 50 
players in Griffin (considered by many as the top prospect in nation), 
Barrett and Toney-El. All three should step into the starting lineup or find 
extensive playing time off the bench. 
	3. Oklahoma
F James Wright, 6-6, Winchendon School, Mass.
F Johnnie Gilbert, 6-7, Minneapolis-Patrick Henry, Minn.
F Aaron McGhee, 6-8, Vincenness JC, Ind.
F Daryan Selvy, 6-6, Carl Albert JC, Okla.
C Ronnie Griffin, 6-9, Tallahassee CC, Fla.
G Blake Johnston, 6-1, Midland, Texas
F Joszef Szendrei, 6-9, Northeastern JC, Colo. 
	Coach Kelvin Sampson landed athletes who can run and rebound with power. 
McGhee and Selvy are first-team junior college All-American forwards and both 
Griffin and Szendrei are very strong inside. Wright and Gilbert were highly 
rated preps. 
	4. Oklahoma State
F David Anderson, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va.
G/F Terrence Crawford, 6-6, Oklahoma City-Bishop McGuinness, Okla.
G Ellis Kidd, 6-5, Dallas-Madison, Texas
C Jack Marlow, 6-11, Tulsa-Union, Okla.
F Ivan McFarlin, 6-7, Sugar Land-Willowridge, Texas
G Maurice Baker, 6-1, Dixie JC, Utah
G Melvin Sanders, 6-5, Seward CC, Kan. 
	Coach Eddie Sutton is very high on Sanders, McFarlin and Crawford. Marlow 
weighs 285 pounds. Kidd can light it up and Anderson is very quick for 6-8. 
Baker and Sanders were Spring additions and can score. 
	5. Iowa
C Jared Reiner, 6-11, Tripp-Delmont, S.D.
F Glen Worley, 6-8, Iowa City-West, Iowa
G Brody Boyd, 5-10, Dugger-Union, Ind.
F Courtney Scott, 6-6, Lansing-Waverly, Mich.
F Sean Sonderleiter, 6-9, Des Moines-Christian, Iowa
F Reggie Evans, 6-8, Pensacola-Woodham, Fla/Coffeyville CC, Kan. 
	Guard Luke Recker and guard Ryan Hogan, both redshirt transfers, also join 
the Hawkeyes. This is one of the top Hawkeye classes ever, as coach Steve 
Alford signed a highly rated center in Reiner (who passed on UConn and 
Kansas), a top forward in Worley and an unbelievable shooter in Boyd. Evans 
is considered a top junior college prospect at power forward and Hogan played 
at Kentucky before transferring. The huge prize is Recker, who transferred to 
Arizona from Indiana and then moved to Iowa in order to be nearer his family 
and girlfriend, who was seriously injured in a car accident. After an appeal, 
the NCAA allowed eligibility this fall. Recker averaged 16 points as a 
sophomore for the Hoosiers and was third-team all-Big Ten. The Hawkeyes 
already have a junior committment from one of the top guards in the nation, 
Pierre Pierce of Westmont, Ill. 
	6. St. John's
G Omar Cook, 6-1, Middle Village-Christ the King, N.Y.
F Kyle Cuffe, 6-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y.
C Mohammed Diakite, 6-11, Rockville-Montrose Christian Academy, Md.
G Willie Shaw, 6-6, Bronx-Stevenson, N.Y.
C Curtis Johnson, 7-4, Norfolk-Ryan Academy, Va. 
	Forward Alpha Bangura and center Abe Keita are coming off redshirt years, 
which makes coach Mike Jarvis' list of fresh faces even bigger. Jarvis had 
corralled a super class, perhaps best in the nation, but the key was F Darius 
Miles, 6-9, East St. Louis, Ill. A do-everything player generally rated among 
the top three prospects in the country, Miles turned to the NBA rather than 
attend St. John's. Without him, this group tumbles a few notches from their 
No. 1 ranking after the early signing period. Cook is dynamic and Diakite 
could the Red Storm's best center in years. Both have great basketball bodies 
and athleticism. Johnson was a late addition and is considered a project. F 
Eric King, 6-7, Brooklyn-Lincoln, NY., had entrance problems. 
	7. Cincinnati
F Jamaal Davis, 6-8, Purdue/Barton County CC, Kan.
F Rod Flowers, 6-8, Huntsville, Ala.
G Field Williams, 6-3, Houston-Waltrip, Texas
F Antwan Jones, 6-8, Tallahassee CC, Fla.
G Immanuel McElroy, 6-4, Tyler JC, Tex. 
	Reloading, the Bearcats have a great class with junior college standouts 
Jones, McElroy and Davis. Davis played at Purdue before transferring. Flowers 
and Williams are promising. National-quality guard/forward Jerome Harper of 
Columbia, S.C., had his letter withdrawn due to off-court/entrance problems 
and will attend junior college. 
	8. Texas
G/F Brandon Mouton, 6-5, Lafayette-St. Thomas More, La.
C/F Brian Boddicker, 6-9, Duncanville, Texas
C Jason Klotz, 6-11, Houston-Klein Forest, Texas
F James Thomas, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va.
G Fredie Williams, 6-2, Mississippi Delta CC, Miss.
G Royal Ivey, 6-3, Blairstown, N.J. 
	This group, powered by big men wanting to play for coach Rick Barnes, is one 
of the nation's best. Thomas is tough and Boddicker was rated the best 
propect in the state. Both should get playing time with the departure of 
center Chris Mihm to the NBA. Purdue wanted Mouton badly, as he is a major 
offensive threat. Other keys are Ivey, Williams and Klotz. 
	9. Indiana
F Jared Jeffries, 6-10, Bloomington-North, Ind.
F/G A.J. Moye, 6-5, Atlanta-Westlake, Ga.
G Andre Owens, 6-3, Indianapolis-Meridian, Ind.
F Mike Roberts, 6-8, New Hampton-Prep, N.H. 
	Coach Bob Knight and the Hoosiers shocked Duke by signing Jeffries, one of 
the best forwards in the nation, and all four prospects are top quality. Moye 
is a physical player and suited for the Big Ten wars, and Owens and Roberts 
are very tough. Jeffries, a huge believer in Knight, threatened to transfer 
if the veteran coach had been fired. 
	10. Michigan State
G Marcus Taylor, 6-3, Lansing-Waverly, Mich.
F Zach Randolph, 6-8, Marion, Ind. 
	Spartan followers can't complain about a class with the top guard and 
center/forward in the nation. Higher-rated schools just had more prospects. 
Taylor is outstanding and should see time early. Randolph, still not 
qualified, is a widebody who dominated prep all-star play and could be the 
Spartans' best post player in recent years.		

Please see the attached.  I am still trying to obtain the DOE reports for 
Canada from Juanita Marchand for Question #19 of the Pan Alberta.  Any help 
you could give me there would be greatly appreciated.

Brian,  Do you know how quick D&B would have data entered into this system?  
We need to move this as fast as possible.

One of the contract administrators in my group was not able to find the DUNS 
number you provided in the D&B database online.  I am not sure how quickly 
updates are made to their database.  Are you aware when this number was 
issued?  I will put in a request to inquire again at the beginning of next 
week.  If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to give me 
a call.  Thanks.

Chris,  My comments are as follows:

 1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
of the current definitive term?

 2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
accomplished.

 3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".  Does this day match the gas day for 
the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 

 4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?

initialled off by yourself, when this is accomplished.

Thanks!!.

I would structure the agreement as an absolute obligation by ENA to pay the 
full amount, as that is what they have committed.  Our arrangement with Tejas 
is outside this agreement and should be handled separately.  Make that change 
and let's execute.  Call Janet Wallis to determine the ENA person to execute.

Candace L Bywaters
05/22/2000 08:09 AM
Please review the enclosed document.  I find it satisfactory, especially in 
light that it allows that "up to $44,780" will be reimbursed by ENA to HPL, 
since we're still awaiting word from Tejas as to whether or not they will 
participate.

If this looks fine to you, please advise and I will have two originals 
presented to you for your execution.  Who would you think would be the 
appropriate executor for ENA?

Thanks!

How is it going brother?  Got that house finished yet?    Wanted to see if 
you were going to be in town for the Memorial Day weekend.  I was kicking 
around the idea of doing some tubing and maybe stopping by Austion for a 
night to chase some good looking Austin women.  Drop me a line.

Gerald, I am pursuing a narrow window for collection of moneys due and owing 
Intratex by Citgo.  I am required to provide information about the company 
status of Intratex, and if it is dissolved as I believe it to be I am to 
provide a copy of its dissolution papers.

requests.  Could you possible get that information to me instead?

I would appreciate it!  Thanks!

Mary,  Here is another one from Candy.  Might want to check with AEW to make

Along the same lines as my previous request for Intratex's company 
dissolution, I would like to verify the status of HPL Resources Company and, 
if it is also dissolved, would request a copy of the dissolution.

I am making filings to the State's Comptroller's office for payment of 
suspensed moneys and the form requires this type of information and 
documentation.

Thanks, and would appreciate this information at your earliest convenience.

  I am trying to compare the CA1 doc with the CA doc.   Thanks for your help.

GT,

Congratulations on the engagement!  Hate to see a good man go down, but it 
happens to the best of us.  Sounds like things are going really well for 
you.  When is the wedding?  Sounds like there are a lot of wedding bells in 
the Townsend family these days.

With respect to the weekend; change of plans.  I will be staying in Houston 
this weekend.  However, the following weekend myself and the red-faced Eric 
and possibly his wife want to come to Austin to hang out.  Are you around 
that weekend and could you handle 3 people crashing at your place.  If its a 
problem let me know.

G,

I will be in town this weekend but my sister is getting married Saturday so
I will be tied up until late Saturday night. Does that fit your schedule.

Also, I am now an engaged man. Heather and I are super happy but don't
worry, that does not change things buddy. I am going to need all the male
bonding I can get. Heather is going to Spring on Sunday so I have Sunday and
Monday totally free.

Let me know
GT

Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating 
the changes we discussed.  I have not changed either the liquidated damages 
or force majeure provisions at this point.  Ron, you indicated in your voice 
mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect 
to those provisions.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the 
uncertainty on the two provisions.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks

Heidi,  I have reviewed the contracts and the amendments and the following is 
their status:

 1.  Contract Number 96006959 (012-41991-02-004)  Amended April 1, 1999

  Term:  Month to Month and may be terminated by either party with 10 days 
written notice prior to end of the month (But see rate section below)

  Rate:  Agreement was amended on April 1, 1999 to put a flat rate of $0.085 
for all receipts at Thompsonville (Meter #6351) through March 31,   2006 
(This language would override the month to month term)  No other Points of 
Receipt are allowed under this contract.

  Note:  Prior to the Amendment on April 1, 1999, the $0.01 fee escalator was 
still in effect for any volumes moved under this contract prior to the   
Amendment.  If the escalator wasn't assessed during that time, it should have 
been.  This escalator would have applied to all receipts and    fees on the 
original Exhibit A to the contract. 

 2.  Contract Number 96006966 (012-41991-02-003)  Amended April 1, 1999

  Term:  In effect through March 31, 2006

  Rate:  Those set forth on Exhibit A as amended on April1, 1999 for the 
terms set forth on Exhibit A.

Let me know if you have any questions concerning the above summary.  

Brad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the 
Lease Docs for the MEGS Facilities? I forward those documents about a month 
back.

Greg,  Attached is the document we discussed.  Please review.  Mariner is a 
party to this agreement since Mariner is performing all operations and 
maintence functions for the MEGS assets and this is consistent with the 
Operation and Maintance Agreement between Mariner and MEGS.  Please call me 
at (713) 853-3512 with questions.

Bruce,  The legal description for my house is as follows:

 Lot 27 Ranch Estates, an addition in Harris County, Texas according to the 
map or plat thereof recorded in Volume 22, Page 68 of the Map Records of 
Harris County, Texas.

Thanks

Our risk manager has reviewed the insurance requirements.  His only comment 
concerned the Owner's/Contractor's Protective Liability Insurace requirement 
on the bottom of the first page of Exhibit E.  He thinks this is unnecessary 
as we have adequate coverage under the General Liability and Excess Umbrella 
Liability.  Since this cost is likely to be passed on to us, we should waive 
this insurance requirement.  

Everything else is OK from our perspective.  Let me know if you need any 
further information or have any questions.

Rude-Dog,

How is it going out there brother?  Been keeping your sanity while living at 
home?  Things here are about the same.  Talked to your boy Tree the other 
day.  He had some interesting new developments in his love life.  Of course 
they were sordid and made me somewhat uncomfortable.  Well sort of. Your 
furniture is still almost completely intact.  The longer you stay out there, 
the better my chances of picking up some furniture real cheap.  Haven't seen 
that much of Janel lately.  She went out to Florida this weekend to convince 
a gay guy that the opposite sex is not icky after all.   Should make for some 
interesting stories when she returns.   Drop me a note when you get a 
chance.  Talk at you later.

Check out the attached response from Marathon concerning our revisions.  I

Lori,  Thanks for the diskettes.  The one disk did have the final version of

use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements.  
Should have drafts for BR's review later this week.  Do you want these

I talked to Shonnie about any amendments to the LLC and Capacity Allocation

I checked my computer and couldn't find any evidence of the files on my hard

contain the same documents, some of which look like they might be the
finals.  If you'll email your street address back to my assistant, April
Williams, at awilliams@br-inc.com, we can have the diskettes sent to you via
courier.  You can take a look at them and see if in fact they are identical
and have the information you need on them.  If you find them to be exactly

I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our 
modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the 
modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.

MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to 
Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were 
simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with 
respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such 
risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's transfer 
of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which Marathon can 
look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.  The 
alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and 
maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these reasons, 
I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide 
the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such a transfer to 
MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the Production 
Handling Agreement.

Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming 
jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does not 
hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should 
not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.  Mariner 
should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.

I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions at 
your convenience or to discuss the above further.

I had actually called you before I had seen this email.  I wasn't involved in 
the NOx emissions deal.  I don't think legal was involved at all, at least 
from a Compression Services perspective.  Mark Courtney was the deal maker 
for Compression Services and I believe that John Scarborough, an analyst was 
also involved.

Gerald, It seems that the drafts that have been sent back to Marathon have 
confused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example you 
have requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner and 
MEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remain 
between MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes. 
The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft are 
confusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be on 
Mariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this 
manner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have been 
altered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention of 
MEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity 
(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to Platform 
Operator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level of 
protection with MEGS.
If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSA 
that addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for any 
resolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy to 
discuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by line 
please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to 
do so.

Please see attached.  Thanks.

Attached is the draft CA for Intergen.  Note that there are still several 
blanks in the Agreement that I need information to complete.  Please review 
and let me know if you have any questions.

Greg,  

Attached is correspondence between Marathon and Enron (MEGS) concerning the 
revised draft of the lease that I had forwarded for Marathon's review and 
also to you for Mariner's review.  I wanted to give you the benefit of these 
discussion we have had with Marathon concerning how the MEGS and Mariner's 
responsibilities should be split.  Our intent with these revisions, and the 
our goals as we continue to work with Marathon on these issues is to simply 
allocate the risks between Mariner and MEGS with respect to Marathon, as 
Mariner and MEGS intended them to be allocated under the O&M Agreement 
between the two.  We are not asking Marathon to rely on the O&M Agreement to 
which they are not a party.  Risk associated with ownership of the flowline 
should run to MEGS and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of 
the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to Mariner as they 
currently do under the Production Handling Agreement.  We intend to work with 
Marathon toward this end.  If you have any comments concerning these 
discussions or would like to discuss this further with me, please contact me 
at (713) 853-3512.  I would also be interested in any comments you may have 
with respect to the draft lease agreement I forwarded to you earlier.  Thanks.

How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although 
enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't 
able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when 
I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and 
everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see 
the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie 
Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had 
cancelled.  Great.  Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.  Cool.   
Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that 
my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.  I had to have the 
car towed back into downtown.  Anyway, it was an interesting trip.

Kay,  Please see attached.  Thanks

Staci,  Attached is the amendment.  Please forward your revisions for my 
review.  Thanks.

Got my car back.  $700 to fix.  Ouch!  I am really just glad it wasn't 
worse.  When I stopped my car it was really smoking and I was afraid I had 
burned my moter up.  Eric was providing my transportation during the absence 
of the car.  What a great guy.  Yes, we should try to hook up this weekend.  
The only thing I have going right now is a party that one of the attorneys in 
my group is throwing Saturday night.  Hopefully I will be able to get out of 
there fairly early.  Let's talk before the weekend to try and work something 
out.   I am interested in discussing the Anne situation with you also.  Talk

Your weekend sounds like a nightmare.  I guess now you have a great excuse to 
buy a new car.  What did the garage say about the problem(s)?  

My weekend was pretty fun.  I went to a happy hour Friday night with the 
power trading folks -- now that I'm gone, they're all friendly and talk to 
me.  My cleaning lady came on Saturday so I met two friends for brunch at 
Guggenheim's and we were their from 11:00 to 3:30!  Totally killed the day, 
but it was nice and relaxing.  I did manage to run some errands (something 
productive).  Anne (tall blonde that was at the happy hour) and I went to 
Liberty Noodles for dinner and then hit the downtown bar scene -- totally 
boring.  (Anne is single these days if you want me to hook you up).  Sunday, 
more brunching and then Anne and I went to see Mission Impossible 2...Tom 
Cruise is still totally hot and i didn't mind watching him for two hours.  
That was it.  Not very exciting.  

We should try and do something this weekend.  I have another happy hour 
Friday night but other than that no plans.  This week is pretty busy.  I'm 
starting to panic.  Gotta run.

By the way....how are you getting around these days?

Here it is guys.  Still checking for any cleanups, but in interest of time I 
am forward for your review.  It is redlined against the previous revised 
version.

Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the revisions.  Some

inconsistencies in the original document.  Please review and let me know if 
you have any questions.  I plan on being at the Member Meeting in Denver next

I have executed the Interconnect Agreement with CPS.  Please proceed to issue 
the required work orders.

Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

FYI  Attached are the FERC materials we discussed earlier concerning third 
party ownership of compression in interstate pipes.

I will continue to research and see what might work.

Here are two FERC cases for your ECS files.  The certificates for Cotton 
Valley Compression are on tomorrow's FERC agenda.  The forthcoming orders may 
be relevant to future ECS projects.  With respect to Transwestern, the 
attached orders make it clear that the FERC knows how to order what it views 
as a jurisdictional entity to show cause regarding its status and, ultimately 
to file for a certificate.  This is consistent with our view  of the 
Transwestern order. - Randy

Attached are redlined versions of an amended and restated LLC agreement and 
an amendment to the Administrative Services Agreement.  I decided to simply 
amend the Admin. Agreement since the change was so minor.  You will note that 
the changes in the LLC Agreement were solely to accommodate the revisions 
made in the Capacity Allocation Agreement which I forwarded earlier.  Please 
call if you have any questions.

Mark,  Attached are the confirms for both the ECS purchase and the ECT 
purchase.  Please take one last look.  If OK I will forward the ECS purchase 
to Porter and Hedges.

The ECT confirms still have the TW West Texas Pool as being the point at 
which ECT takes title.

Cris,  Attached are redline versions of revisions to the Lost Creek Capacity 
Allocation and Expansion Agreement which we had discussed some time back.  
The changes were made to accommodate several goals, but the one that you 
should have any concern with are in Section 2.3 and the definition of Third 
Party Gathering Agreement.

 

Rob,  Attached are redlined versions of the Lost Creek Docs displaying the 
revisions we had discussed some time back.  Please review and let me know of 
any issues you see with respect to the financing.

I am doing fine.  Work is fairly busy.  I went to Austin last weekend to see 
George.  He is engaged now and I think he will get married March of next 
year.  Met his fiance and she is really nice.  

I received Jacob's B-day invitation in the mail this week.  Please let Janice 
know that I am sorry but won't be able to come down for the Party.  I will be 
coming down for the family reunion on July 1.  I will see the kids then.  I 
guess Sharon and Will are planning on coming down for the reunion also.  I 
will probably be there late Friday night.

Take care and talk to you later

Haven't heard from you in awhile.   Is everything o.k..........We are all
fine getting some rain today from that tropical depression. Not much they
told us we would get 3to4 inches. I think they kinda blew it out of
proportion. Dad's playing cards and I'm just writing some e-mails. So how
are things going.I guess you have been busy at work. Dad went to Robstown
yesterday for a field day tour with James and he said James has some real
good crops so far. Now if he can harvest them all That will be the test.

Jamie,
Thank you for coming by.  I actually had a conversation with JC this morning 
regarding electrical compression.  I have an idea I am working on and I was 
wondering if I gave you horsepower requirements and assumed  distances from 
high voltage power lines for 4 compression stations along a pipeline.  Would 
it be a big deal for you to get me some estimated rates?
Again,  this is only an idea right now so I don't want you spinning your 
wheels if it takes a lot of work.  But, I thought if you just had a couple of 
spreadsheets that you needed to fill in some blanks on, maybe you could do it?
Also, the total horsepower requirements are on the order of 13,755 hp in 4 
stations.  So if your minimum is 9,000 hp per station we can't hit that, but 
if it is a 9,000 hp min. on a project as a whole then it might amount to 
something.
Thanks,
Gaylen

Shelley,

Thank you for your time last week.  I enjoyed meeting with you and your
colleagues to discuss electric motor compression and its applications for
the Questar system.  As I was walking out of the building, JC and I had a
couple of minutes to chat and he told me that he would give me a call
sometime in the next couple of weeks to discuss some projects that Questar
may be considering in the near future.

I am looking forward to exploring opportunities with you.

If you have any questions, or need any further information from me, please
do not hesitate to call.

that she had on the hubbard document.  i am waiting for the final comments 
from dushinske, but they should come today.  i would like to get everything 
signed today because we want to make sure that we can book the gas at these 
high prices.

2)  vector term sheet.  i seem to have deleted my copy of the most recent 
draft we had circulating.  can you send me your most recent update, please?

if i hear anything from dushinske, i will let you know,

thanks,

Attached is the ECS Amendment with the changes I discussed with Gerald to 
3.7(c). 

Attached are the latest revised redlined documents for Lost Creek.   Please 
note the following:
 
1.  The changes include those that Chris and I discussed in Denver.  The 
Capacity Allocation Agreement is redlined against the version BR had reviewed 
earlier.  All other docs. are redlined against the originals.

2.  Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel 
Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement.  
This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value 
which covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio 
calcs in the Credit Agreement.  The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be 
distributed under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of 
these excess amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.

3.  Since more significant changes were made to the Admin. Services 
Agreement, it is now being amended and restated.

Gerald,

In reviewing the changes I need to see what the "Firm Schedules" are.  This
looks like it is new and is apparently part of the Firm gathering
agreements.  Also, would it be possible to get a red-line version of the
documents that compares these latest changes with the originally executed
documents as I think some of the interim changes have been absorbed already.
Give me a call if you need any clarification.  713-624-9003.

Shonnie,  I believe Brian left you a voicemail about this. Here is the latest 
from Hanover.  These guys are trying to renegotiate this deal.  Lets talk 
about this after you have had a chance to review.

	Ken Choyce@ENRON
	06/21/2000 02:37 PM
		 
Gerald,

Wanted to keep you in the loop on where Hanover would like to see things 
going with our contract.  They've been complaining almost from day 1 and 
their format is getting a little more formal and aggressive as seen in the 
attached spreadsheet and memo.  The attached memo in my opinion violates in 
several points made the spirit of the intent of the agreement as executed.  
The guy that put this together (Jerry Griffith) was not a Hanover employee 
when the contract was negotiated.  I believe he is being put up to this by 
his management who appear to want to change some very fundamental things that 
were agreed to (most of which were explicitly spelled out in the document).  
No action requested of you I just wanted you to be informed. Thanks

Ken

this is our strawman, best shot at a methodology to get started;
pls comment,
I would like to proceed with this and try to get together in Denver
sometime during the first week in July, maybe Weds & Thurs & or Friday or
possibly
the end of next week.
We need this resolved, an acceptable consencious to allow us to proceed as
necessary in the future.
thx

Dan,  I have reviewed the Wildhorse (Mesa) Gathering, Processing, and 
Transport Agreement.  This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated 
to this Agreement through 2013.  The agreement present some problematic 
issues which I will outline.

 1. Gas Quality -  The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to 
transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers (in this case 
Northwest Pipeline) gas quality specifications.  We propose to put in a 
treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications, however 
there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant 
between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse could delay are extract 
value from us for this connection.  This is an uncertainty.

 2.  Wildhorse Obligation to Perform - Based on my understanding of the 
facts, at some point during the term of this agreement, Northwest Pipeline 
enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the 
downstream side of Wildhorse's Gathering System. As a result, Wildhorse shut 
in Enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since.  Wildhorse has a 
right to do this under this Agreement (see #1 above) and therefore Wildhorse 
has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement.  
Wildhorse's obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the 
gas.

 3.  Unprofitability - Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the 
treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications, they 
could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was 
still uneconomical for them to do so.  If they decided it is uneconomical for 
them to do so, they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential 
solutions which include (i) renegotiating the terms (ii) allowing Enogex to 
operate Wildhorse's equipment at Enogex sole cost, expense and risk, or (iii) 
release the gas from the Agreement.  The problem here is that there is no 
time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no 
specific solution they must reach.   Wildhorse could drag this out for some 
extended period of time and they could extract significant value.

My  recommendation is that we make Enogex's resolution of these issues with 
Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal. I know the 
timing is late.  However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of 
negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the 
gas,  everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take 
substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage.   

Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions.  

Have a great trip and try not to hook up with too many Italian hotties!  Must 
come back with lots of pictures and potentially a few life changing 
experiences.

Attached are executables for the Hubbard Transaction.

Mark,  Please review the attached letter and provide the missing date.  If 
everything looks good, I will prepare an original for your signature.  

Also,  do you have any resolution on the TW transport issue?  Is it 
acceptable for ECT to take title at the West Texas Pool and ECS still operate 
the transport agreement as its agent?

 

Heidi,  Attached is the modified confirm form.  Please note the following:

1.  This will only work with an Interruptible all points master contract
2.  This confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement.  We need to 
make sure that the master is still in its term.
3.  The counter -party should sign off for every transaction.  Via fax 
signature is acceptable.
4.  A single form per contract must be used.
5.  This form is set up for 1 month or less deals.

We need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global 
contract # for the master contract.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald -

Where do you stand on reviewing the Gregg agreement?  Just a quick update, 
please.

Thanks,
Chris Sonneborn
HPL Facility Planning

Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my 
revisions.  The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for 
the first project.  I change to reflect the change we made at that time.  As 
you will notice it is quite a few changes.  However, since Gregg signed off 
on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.

I reviewed the draft you forwarded.  Looks good.  I have the following two 
questions:  

Section 1.1 - The fourth sentence down in the parenthesis "(whether owned or 
leased by LESSEE)".  Shouldn't that read "(whether owned, operated, or leased 
by LESSEE)" since Mariner only operates the Property for MEGS?

Term  -  Shouldn't the term mirror the term for the Production Handling 
Agreement?  Section 7.1.2.e allows termination after January 1, 2005.  Why 
would Marathon want to terminate while the PHA is still in effect?

We're putting together a golf tournament for Friday morning, August 18 at
Estes Park Golf Club.  I've already talked to the pro and I told him I could
give him a head count within the next few days.  For now, he's got us
penciled in for about 10 tee times beginning at 8:32 a.m.  (I'll be playing
in that first foursome since it's most important that I get to the church
before any of you knuckleheads).  The cost will be $44.00 (green fee and 1/2
cart).  Please let me know as soon as possible, via return email, whether
you want to play.

                           ORDER ISSUING CERTIFICATE

                               September 1, 1998

PANEL:
 [*1]  Before Commissioners: James J. Hoecker, Chairman; Vicky A. Bailey,
William L. Massey, Linda Breathitt, and Curt Hebert, Jr.

OPINION:

   On March 2, 1998, Clear Creek Storage Company, L.L.C. (Clear Creek) file=
d=20
an
application pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), for a
certificate to convert a natural gas production reservoir to a natural gas
storage facility, to construct appurtenant facilities, and to operate the
storage field and related facilities for the sole use of Clear Creek's two
owners, Questar Energy Trading Company (Questar Energy) and Montana Power
Ventures, Inc. (Montana Power). Clear Creek requests that, to the extent
feasible, the authorization granted to it be a limited jurisdiction=20
certificate.
Clear Creek also requests waivers of various Commission regulations and
requirements.

   For the reasons discussed below, we will grant Clear Creek's request for
authorization to convert the production reservoir to a gas storage facility=
=20
and
to construct and operate facilities. However, we will require Clear Creek t=
o
operate the facility on an open access basis.

I. Background

   Questar Energy and Montana Power formed Clear Creek to own and operate t=
he
proposed Clear Creek storage [*2]  project. Questar Energy owns 75 percent =
and
Montana Power owns 25 percent of Clear Creek. Questar Energy is a wholly-ow=
ned
subsidiary of Questar Corporation and a natural gas marketing affiliate of
Questar Pipeline Company, an interstate pipeline. Questar Energy engages in
marketing of natural gas, crude oil, and electricity. It purchases natural =
gas
from affiliated production companies and unaffiliated companies.

   Montana Power is an affiliate of Montana Power Company, an electric and =
gas
utility regulated by the Commission as well as the State of Montana. Montan=
a
Power engages in natural gas business development, which will include=20
purchasing
and selling natural gas upon approval of Clear Creek's application.

Clear Creek states that both Questar Energy and Montana Power plan to activ=
ely
purchase and sell natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region, and elsewhere i=
n=20
the
United States. Therefore, they both wish to develop storage capabilities to
better manage their natural gas supplies, including the balancing of their
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20

                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *2

respective natural gas supplies and supply acquisition opportunities with
current and projected demand for natural gas. Clear Creek states that the
storage capacity will [*3]  assist Questar Energy and Montana Power to buy =
and
sell gas when it is most economically favorable to do so, to offer more=20
reliable
supply products to potential customers, and to manage transportation=20
obligations
to minimize exposure to penalties and cashout charges.

   Clear Creek proposes to locate its storage project in the depleted Nugge=
t
reservoir in the Clear Creek Field in Uinta County, Wyoming, an active natu=
ral
gas production region. Chevron, Inc. discovered the field in 1978. The fiel=
d
produced gas from 1979 until 1994 when it was shut-in after production of o=
il
and gas from the field was no longer economic. Prior to shut-in, 15 wells
produced natural gas that was delivered through existing pipeline facilitie=
s
into Northwest Pipeline Corporation, Kern River Gas Transmission Company, a=
nd
Questar Pipeline Company.

   Clear Creek states that the interconnecting pipeline taps, laterals,
gathering facilities and wells are still in place and, with minor=20
modifications,
will be used to transport gas in and out of the proposed storage facility.

   Questar Energy has owned and operated the Clear Creek field since late=
=20
1993,
having acquired it from its affiliate, Universal Resources Corporation [*4]
(Universal), a natural gas producer. Universal tested the field in 1996 and=
=20
1997
and determined that the depleted oil/gas reservoir in the Nugget formation =
can
economically be converted to a storage project of up to 4 Bcf of working ga=
s.=20

Questar Energy plans to transfer its interests in the field to Clear Creek.

II. Proposal

Clear Creek proposes to convert a reservoir in the Nugget formation in a
depleted natural gas production field in the Clear Creek Participation Area=
=20
(PA)
of the Painter Reservoir Unit to a gas storage facility. The Clear Creek PA=
 is
located in Uinta County, Wyoming, approximately 15 miles northeast of=20
Evanston.
The proposed project would reuse facilities in place within the Clear Creek=
 PA
from previous activities [*5]  in Sections 4 and 9 of the production field.
Lands in Section 4 are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) =
and
lands in Section 9 are owned privately by Uinta Livestock Grazing Partnersh=
ip.

   The Nugget formation is located at an approximate depth of 8700 feet and
storage will be water driven. Clear Creek expects to operate the storage
reservoir at a pressure of approximately 3200 psi. Clear Creek proposes to
develop 4 Bcf of working storage capacity, supported by 2 to 4 Bcf of cushi=
on
gas. Questar Energy and Montana Power will supply cushion gas in proportion=
 to
their membership interests. The project is expected to have a maximum gas
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 3
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *5

injection capability of up to 35 MMcf/day (at approximately 4200 psi) and a
maximum withdrawal capability of up to 50 MMcf/day (at approximately 750 ps=
i).

   Clear Creek states that it will own and be responsible for operating the
storage project. Under the Construction, Operation and Management Agreement
between Clear Creek, Questar Energy and Montana Power, Clear Creek will=20
contract
with Questar Energy to operate the field on a day to day basis.

   A. Facilities

   Clear Creek states that conversion of the field to storage will require
minimal construction [*6]  and will enable it to maximize the use of existi=
ng
facilities that were installed in connection with previous exploration and
production activity at the field.

   Clear Creek proposes to use a single, existing well (#44-4) for injectio=
ns
and withdrawals and up to 8 existing wells for monitoring. Clear Creek expe=
cts
to use the existing roads, pipeline facilities, buildings, fencing,
rights-of-way, pads, and cleared areas, and some of the existing storage=20
tanks.

   Clear Creek proposes to install the following new facilities:

   two 2100-hp compressors (possibly leased), which will be installed in an
existing building designed and historically used for compressors;

   one Joule-Thompson Liquid Extraction Plant (skid mounted), which will be
located in an already cleared, fenced site;

   new insulation, wrapping and electric heat tracing for the existing
injection/withdrawal line that connects the injection/withdrawal well to th=
e
compressor building;

   one 30,000-gallon natural gas liquids storage tank, located in an existi=
ng
cleared, fenced site;

   a skid-mounted production unit to separate water and free hydrocarbon=20
liquids
from the production stream during withdrawal operations;

   two additional 400-barrel [*7]  water tanks, to be located in pre-distur=
bed
sites;

   new 3.5-inch tubing in the injection/withdrawal well, #44-4, inside the
existing 5.5-inch casing; and communications and monitoring equipment.

   Clear Creek anticipates that it also will be necessary to modify existin=
g
pipeline facilities that connect the field to Questar Pipeline. Clear Creek
expects Questar Pipeline to replace, under its blanket construction=20
certificate,
approximately 50 feet of 4-inch pipe and meter run with an equivalent lengt=
h=20
of
6-inch pipe and meter run. Clear Creek requests authority to modify its lin=
e
connected to the Clear Creek Field to accommodate those modifications by=20
Questar
Pipeline.

   Clear Creek states that, historically, gas was delivered from the field=
=20
into
Questar Pipeline, and was received from and delivered back to Questar Pipel=
ine
during Universal's well tests. Clear Creek submits that, in the future, it
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 4
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *7

expects to receive gas from and deliver gas to other pipelines in the area,
including Northwest Pipeline Corporation and Kern River. However, Clear Cre=
ek
does not seek approval at this time to construct any facilities necessary t=
o
implement these additional receipt and delivery points.

   B. Services [*8]

   Clear Creek proposes to render storage services solely for its two membe=
rs,
Questar Energy and Montana Power, which will receive storage capacity right=
s=20
in
direct proportion to their ownership interests, i.e., Questar Energy will h=
ave
use of 75 percent of the field's storage capacity and Montana Power will ha=
ve
use of 25 percent of the capacity. Questar Energy and Montana Power will al=
so
have firm use of injection and withdrawal capabilities totaling 35 MMcf/d a=
nd=20
50
MMcf/d, respectively, on a percentage basis equal to the share of storage
capacity rights. Each will have a right to unused injection and withdrawal
capabilities on an interruptible basis.

Clear Creek proposes to provide no storage service to any entity other than=
=20
its
owners. Questar Energy and Montana Power will each own and store its own ga=
s=20
in
the capacity it holds.

   C. Requested Waivers

   Clear Creek states that it neither requests nor desires a blanket=20
certificate
to transport for others. Therefore, Clear Creek requests the Commission to=
=20
waive
any requirement that the proposed project be operated on an open access bas=
is.

   Clear Creek submits that its proposal is different from the situations
presented in two cases,  [*9]  Total Peaking Services, L.L.C. (Total Peakin=
g)=20
n2
and Hopkinton LNG Corporation (Hopkinton), n3 in which the Commission rejec=
ted
private storage proposals involving existing liquid natural gas (LNG)=20
facilities
belonging to local distribution companies (LDCs) and required the applicant=
s=20
to
provide open access storage. Unlike those cases, Clear Creek maintains, its
proposed project is not located in a market area but in a supply area=20
surrounded
by both major production areas and major interstate pipelines. In addition,=
=20
the
reservoir Clear Creek proposes to convert to storage was not previously
developed by a regulated LDC or any other form of regulated entity and thus
there are no risks of cross-subsidies by ratepayers. Further, submits Clear
Creek, there are no concerns about an affiliated LDC engaging in capacity
brokering to deliver gas to or from market area LNG plants, a unique market
advantage described by the Commission in Total Peaking.

   Further, Clear Creek argues, its proposal is for a small, low budget=20
project
which cannot readily be increased in size to accommodate new demands for=20
storage
from a third-party without a great increase in associated costs and, to a=

PAGE 5
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *10

the quantity of storage available to Questar Energy and Montana Power would
undermine their incentives to proceed. Clear Creek states that the project'=
s
costs would increase due to the sizable regulatory burdens associated with
preparing and maintaining tariffs, ratemaking, utility-based accounting
practices, reporting, GISB, EBBs, additional personnel, and=20
marketing-affiliate
rules requiring separation of Clear Creek from its two marketer owners.=20
Further,
it contends, an open access requirement would expose it to economic risks a=
nd
third-party liability issues such as risks of gas loss, force majeure, proj=
ect
failure, and credit that do not exist for a project that would only serve i=
ts
two owners.

Accordingly, Clear Creek requests waivers of all reporting requirements,
including the obligation to file Form 2 or similar reports; any obligation =
to
file rates, tariffs,  [*11]  contracts, or contract amendments; any obligat=
ion
to justify rates on any basis other than those the parties negotiated as pa=

IV. Discussion

   A. Jurisdiction

   Since the proposed facilities will be used for the transportation of=20
natural
gas in interstate commerce subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, the
requested authorization is subject to section 7(c) of the NGA.

   Clear Creek seeks to distinguish its proposal from those in Hopkinton an=
d
Total Peaking by noting that, unlike those two proposals, its proposed stor=
age
facility is not in the market area and does not raise cross-subsidization o=
r
capacity brokering issues. We recognize that those issues are not present i=
n
Clear Creek's proposal. Nevertheless, its proposal is the same in one=20
overriding
aspect. Clear Creek seeks authorization to perform jurisdictional interstat=
e
transportation with no requirement that such service be offered on an
open-access basis. Such proposals are inconsistent with the regulatory goal=
s
embodied in Order No. 636, which was intended to encourage interstate=20
pipelines
to provide open-access services, including storage. Therefore, we will requ=
ire
Clear Creek to restructure its proposal into one that is consistent with th=
e
principles of Order No. 636. Specifically, we will issue Clear Creek a Part=
=20
284
blanket transportation certificate conditioned on Clear Creek's filing, wit=
hin
60 days of the date of issuance of this order, a revised Exhibit P to its
application, setting forth its proposed tariff and initial rates along with
supporting schedules for open-access firm [*14]  and interruptible storage
service and storage-related transportation that comply with the requirement=
s=20
of
Part 284 and with the Commission's restructuring rules as expressed in Orde=
r=20
No.
636.

   To the extent Clear Creek seeks to charge market-based rates, it must ma=
ke=20
a
showing that it lacks market power. The Commission has issued several order=
s
that provide guidance on the criteria it uses to evaluate market-based rate
proposals. n7 In addition, an applicant's market-based study should be
consistent with the Commission's policy statement on ratemaking n8 and must
show, among other things, that: (a) the relevant market provides good
alternatives to the applicant and is not defined too broadly; (b) the
alternatives are timely; (c) the applicant is not able to exercise market=
=20
power
over the price of the product; and (d) the quality of service is equivalent=
.
Clear Creek should provide this information in the tariff filing required=

above.

   Clear Creek requests a limited jurisdiction certificate. The Commission
issues such certificates to allow nonjurisdictional parties to engage in=20
certain
jurisdictional activities without affecting the status of their otherwise
nonjurisdictional activities. Since Clear Creek's sole function is to provi=
de
interstate storage services, there is no need to issue Clear Creek a limite=
d
jurisdiction certificate. However, we clarify that the authorization grante=
d=20
to
Clear Creek will not affect the nonjurisdictional status of Questar Energy =
or
Montana Power.

   Because we are approving a Part 284 blanket certificate rather than the
limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek requested, Clear Creek must=20
comply
with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to other natural =
gas
companies providing Part 284 service. Accordingly, we deny Clear Creek's=20
request
for waiver of those requirements.

   We will not require Clear Creek to hold an open season since it has
agreements [*16]  with Questar Energy and Montana Power for all of the=20
capacity
of its proposed storage facility and no party has protested the arrangement=
.
Clear Creek's concern that an open- access requirement for its storage=20
facility
would require it to enlarge its project is unfounded. There is no requireme=
nt=20
to
offer more capacity than exists or to increase a facility's capacity to
accommodate potential customers. An open-access transporter need only offer=
 on
an open-access basis existing capacity for which it has no contracts. In th=
is
regard, we note that the agreement between Clear Creek and its two owners i=
s=20
for
all of the existing capacity for a term of twenty years.

   Finally, we note that Clear Creek may apply for a Part 157 blanket
certificate under which it could undertake future modifications to the stor=
age
facilities and operations.

   The Commission has evaluated Clear Creeks's proposal and concludes that =
the
development of the Clear Creek reservoir as an underground gas storage fiel=
d=20
is
feasible. We also evaluated the proposed storage design, facilities, capaci=
ty
and injection/withdrawal estimates and do not foresee any technical problem=
s
regarding the development of this [*17]  field.

   Accordingly, in view of these circumstances, we will require that:

   1. The maximum inventory of natural gas stored in Clear Creek shall not
exceed 8.0 Bcf at 14.73 psia and 60 degrees F, and the maximum shut-in bott=
om
hole reservoir pressure shall not exceed 5500 psig, without prior Commissio=
n
authorization; and

2. Clear Creek shall submit semiannual reports in accordance with section
157.214(c) of the regulations. These reports shall continue to be filed unt=
il
one year after the storage inventory volume has reached or closely=20
approximates
8 Bcf.

 D. Environmental Assessment

   The Commission prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for Clear Creek=
's
proposal. The EA addresses construction procedures, geology, soils, water
resources, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife, hydrostatic testing, federally=
=20
listed
threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, land use, air and no=
ise
quality, and alternatives.

   Based on the discussion in the EA, we conclude that if constructed in
accordance with Clear Creek's application and supplements filed on April 8 =
and
May 20, 1998, approval of this proposal would not constitute a major Federa=
l
action significantly affecting the quality [*18]  of the human environment.

   As recommended in the EA, this authorization includes the following
conditions:

   1. Clear Creek shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation
measures described in its application and supplements (including responses =
to
staff data requests) and as identified in the EA. Clear Creek must:

   a. request any modifications to these procedures, measures, or condition=
s=20
in
a filing with the Secretary of the Commission;

   b. justify each modification relative to site- specific conditions;

   c. explain how that modification provides an equal or greater level of
environmental protection than the original measure; and

d. receive approval in writing from the Director of Office of Pipeline
Regulation (OPR) before using that modification.

   2. The Director of OPR has delegated authority to take whatever steps ar=
e
necessary to ensure protection of all environmental resources during
construction and operation of the project. This authority shall allow:

   a. the modification of conditions of this Order; and b. the design and
implementation of any additional measures deemed necessary (including stop=
=20
work
authority) to assure continued compliance with the intent of the environmen=
tal
[*19]  conditions as well as the avoidance or mitigation of adverse
environmental impact resulting from project construction and operation.

   Any state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional
facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions of this
certificate. The Commission encourages cooperation between natural gas=20
companies
and local authorities. However, this does not mean that state and local
agencies, through application of state or local laws, may prohibit or
unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by=

Background

   The Hunter Pipeline is an interconnection between facilities of Tennesse=
e=20
Gas
Pipeline Company (Tennessee) and TETCO. It consists of two 1,000 horsepower
compressors and approximately 600 feet of above-ground 10-inch diameter gas
pipeline. The Hunter Pipeline is capable of transporting 60,000 Mcf per day=
 of
natural gas.  [*4]

   Texas-Ohio constructed the Hunter Pipeline pursuant to a certificate iss=
ued
by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (Kentucky PSC) on November 19, 19=
90.
This authorization designated Texas-Ohio as an intrastate pipeline operatin=
g=20
as
a transporting utility. However, because Texas-Ohio did not hold an=20
open-season
prior to commencing transportation operations, only Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. an=
d=20
its
sales customers acquired capacity on the Hunter Pipeline. n4 After=20
constructing
the facilities, Texas-Ohio filed an application with the Commission in Dock=
et
No. PR91-5-000 seeking approval of rates under section 311(a)(2) of the=20
Natural
Gas Policy Act (NGPA). The Commission instituted rate proceedings on April =
29,
1991 to determine whether Texas-Ohio's rates were fair and equitable. n5

   n4 Texas-Ohio is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. (TOG)=
, a
Houston-based marketer that ships Gulf Coast gas to northeastern industrial
end-users via Tennessee and TETCO. Prior to construction of the Hunter=20
Pipeline,
TOG faced separate bottlenecks on the Tennessee and TETCO systems during th=
e
winter heating season; the location and capacity of the Hunter Pipeline was
selected to avoid these bottlenecks.

   On June 3, 1991, Texas-Ohio suspended transportation service through the
Hunter Pipeline upon discovering that the gas being moved through those
facilities was not produced in Kentucky and, therefore, that it was engaged=

the interstate transportation of natural gas without authorization under NG=
A
section 7 or NGPA section 311. Subsequently, the Commission instituted an
investigation into the construction and operation of the Hunter Pipeline. T=
hat
investigation determined that from the first day of operation on December 1=
,
1990 through its voluntary shut-down on June 3, 1991, the Hunter Pipeline
transported gas in interstate commerce. n6 On October 19, 1993, the Commiss=
ion
approved a stipulation and consent agreement in which Texas-Ohio agreed to=
=20
pay a
$ 125,000 civil penalty and to implement a program to comply with the NGA a=
nd
NGPA. n7

   n6 Texas-Ohio received all the gas that flowed through the Hunter Pipeli=
ne
from Tennessee's interstate facility. Texas-Ohio then redelivered the gas t=
o
TETCO's interstate facility.

   n7 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,069 (1993).Proposal

   Texas-Ohio requests authorization to operate its facilities in interstat=
e
[*6]  commerce and perform open-access transportation service. Texas-Ohio
proposes to charge firm shippers a transportation rate consisting of a
reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBtu and a commodity charge of $ 0.0103=
=20
per
MMBtu.

   Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a
commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. n8n8 The proposed initial rates are =
the
same as those which Texas-Ohio was authorized to charge during the=20
effectiveness
of the temporary certificate. Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at
61,059 (1992).

   Texas-Ohio states that operation of the Hunter Pipeline will permit=20
shippers
to avoid bottlenecks on the systems of Tennessee and TETCO. TETCO's bottlen=
eck
is located at a point near the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Due to this
constraint, TETCO has historically curtailed the interruptible transportati=
on=20
of
natural gas from receipt points located south of the Kentucky- Tennessee=20
border
that is destined for delivery to points north during the winter heating=20
season.
During the past three winter seasons, TETCO has curtailed interruptible
transportation for gas originating upstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor
station [*7]  in Tennessee that is scheduled for delivery downstream to Zon=
es=20
C
and D.

   The bottleneck on Tennessee's system occurs in Mercer County, Pennsylvan=
ia.
As a result, gas produced and transported from receipt points south of Merc=
er
County cannot be transported to points north of Mercer County during certai=
n
periods of the year. During the past four winter seasons, Tennessee has
curtailed gas moving on an interruptible basis from points upstream of=20
stations
219, 237, and 313 to locations downstream of those stations.

   Texas-Ohio's facilities are positioned to avoid both bottlenecks. In thi=
s
regard, Tennessee typically has interruptible transportation capacity for
deliveries to Texas- Ohio's facilities, but has bottlenecks downstream of i=
ts
interconnection with Texas-Ohio. Conversely, TETCO has a bottleneck upstrea=
m=20
of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, but has capacity for the movement of interruptible
transportation volumes downstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor station. A=
s
such, Texas-Ohio's facilities can be utilized to alleviate bottlenecks on t=
wo
different pipeline systems and thereby move gas to markets in the Northeast=
.

Discussion

   The Commission finds that by utilizing the Hunter [*8]  Pipeline shipper=
s
located upstream of the TETCO bottleneck can utilize Tennessee's system to=
=20
move
gas to Texas-Ohio for redelivery to TETCO and continued transportation
downstream. Shippers upstream of Tennessee's bottleneck, but downstream of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, can, by displacement, utilize Texas-Ohio's system =
to
access the TETCO system for continued transportation downstream. This
arrangement will avoid both the upstream and downstream bottlenecks and all=
ow
continued delivery of gas to various northeast markets located off both the
TETCO and Tennessee systems. We find that the public convenience and necess=
ity
requires issuance of a certificate pursuant to Part 157, subpart A,=20
authorizing
operation of Texas-Ohio's Hunter Pipeline.

   The Commission also finds that Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff generally
complies with the requirements for a Part 284 blanket transportation
certificate. Accordingly, we will grant Texas- Ohio's application for a Par=
t=20
284
blanket transportation certificate, subject to the conditions set forth her=
ein
to ensure Texas-Ohio's full compliance with the conditions of Order Nos. 63=
6,
497, and 566. Texas-Ohio's Part 284 blanket certificate will become effecti=
ve
[*9]  upon Texas-Ohio's full compliance with these conditions.

I. Rates

   Texas-Ohio proposes to charge the initial rates that were approved in th=
e
temporary certificate. Under this proposal, firm shippers would pay a
transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBt=
u=20
and
a commodity charge of $ 0.0103 per MMBtu. Interruptible shippers would pay =
a
transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. =
The
proposed rates are based on the modified fixed variable rate design (MFV), =
100
percent equity capitalization, a 15 percent return on equity, and a 10 perc=
ent
depreciation. The reservation and usage charges are based on 100 percent of=
=20
the
system design capacity.

A. Rate Design

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to use the straight fixed variable (SFV=
)
rate design methodology. n9 Texas-Ohio has not provided any evidence which=
=20
would
support an exception to this requirement. Accordingly, we find that Texas-O=
hio
should be required to use the SFV rate design methodology. Additionally, si=
nce
Texas-Ohio's cost of service does not include any variable costs, we will
require it to use $ 0.0000 as the minimum FTS usage and ITS rates. n10

   n9 See 18 C.F.R. 284.7(d).

   n10 See Gateway Pipeline Co., 55 FERC 61,488 (1991). [*10]  B.=20
Capitalization
and Rate of Return

   Texas-Ohio proposes a capitalization consisting of 100 percent equity. W=
e
find that it is appropriate to use a hypothetical capital structure consist=
ing
of 57 percent debt and 43 percent equity; this structure is based on the 43=
.18
percent average equity ratio held by a group of seven major investor- owned
interstate pipelines at the end of 1993.
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 5
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *10

   We have generally used recent rates for Baa-rated public utility bonds t=
o=20
set
the debt costs on similar projects since Baa is the prevailing rating for
pipeline bonds. The rate for Baa utility bonds averaged 8.40 percent for th=
e=20
six
months ending July 31, 1994, with a one month average of 8.80 percent for J=
uly
1994. We find it appropriate to utilize a cost of debt of 8.50 percent.

   Texas-Ohio's proposed 15 percent rate of return on equity is excessive
considering the prevailing cost of capital. We find acceptable a rate of=20
return
derived from a range of returns based upon an analysis of recent interest=
=20
rates
and a discounted cash flow (DCF) study. The lower end of the range is=20
determined
by the prevailing Baa rating for public utility bonds; as discussed above, =
we
will use a figure of 8.50 percent for [*11]  the most recent six months. Si=
nce
equity is riskier than debt, 100 basis points should be added to the bond=
=20
rate,
thus bringing the lower end of the range to 9.50 percent.

   The upper end of the range is determined by a DCF analysis of a proxy gr=
oup
of seven publicly held natural gas transmission companies. n11 This proxy=
=20
group
is used because the DCF methodology requires market price data as an input =
in
the estimation of investor-expected equity returns. The DCF analysis for th=
e
proxy group results in a range of equity returns of 10.77 percent to 13.41
percent, with a median return of 12.19 percent.

   n11 Coastal Corporation, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Enron Corporation,
Panhandle Eastern, Sonat Inc., Transco Energy, and Williams Companies, Inc.

   This analysis uses dividend yields and forecasts of long- term growth ra=
tes
as follows. For the first five years, the Institutional Brokerage Estimate
System (IBES) estimates of five year growth in earnings per share was used.=
=20
For
longer-term growth (for the years 2000-2010), estimates taken from DRI/McGr=
aw
Hill (Energy Review, Spring-Summer 1994) for growth in the natural gas=20
industry
were used. A growth rate for each company in the [*12]  proxy group was
determined by averaging the two growth rates. Combining the bottom and top
figures establishes a range of 9.50 percent to 13.41 percent. The midpoint =
of
this range is approximately 11.50 percent.

   The Hunter Pipeline went into initial operation in 1990 and faces no
construction risk. Accordingly, we find that the company's risk is no highe=
r
than that of the average pipeline. Therefore, we will require a rate of ret=
urn
on equity of 11.5 percent, which is equal to the midpoint of the range of
reasonableness.

C. Depreciation

   Texas-Ohio proposes a book depreciation rate of 10 percent calculated on=
=20
the
straight-line method which supports an economic life of 10 years. We believ=
e
that the economic life of the Hunter Pipeline will depend upon gas reserves
connected to the Tennessee system and the future demand for natural gas
downstream of those facilities. We are confident that market demand and
operation of Tennessee and TETCO to service downstream markets in the=20
Northeast
States will continue for the next 25 years. We also believe that the Hunter
Pipeline will operate on a permanent basis and play an important role in th=
e
delivery of gas, especially during high demand [*13]  periods. Based on the=
se
factors, we find that an economic life of 25 years should be used to=20
calculate a
depreciation rate of four percent for the Hunter Pipeline facilities.

   II. Pro Forma Tariff

Texas-Ohio has applied for a blanket transportation certificate under secti=
on
284.221 of the Commission's regulations. It  [*14]  proposes to provide bot=
h
firm and interruptible transportation service. To commence service under a
blanket certificate, Texas-Ohio must file and place into effect rates, term=
s,
and conditions that are consistent with Part 284 of the regulations.=20
Texas-Ohio
has not made a tariff filing in this proceeding; it has, however, filed pro
forma tariff sheets which indicate the form its tariff will take. Generally=
,=20
the
pro forma tariff conforms to the Commission's requirements. As discussed=20
below,
however, certain provisions are either inconsistent with the Commission's
policies or are not adequately justified. Certain specific changes that we=
=20
will
require to be made to Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff are set forth in an=20
appendix
to this order.

A. Order No. 636

   Review of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff indicates a number of changes th=
at
must be implemented to satisfy the requirements of Order No. 636. To implem=
ent
those changes, Texas-Ohio must make a tariff filing within 45 days of the d=
ate
of the issuance of this order. Also, Texas-Ohio is reminded that while cert=
ain
provisions of Order No. 636 may not apply at this time, future changes in i=
ts
operations may require tariff revisions to satisfy [*15]  the requirements =
of
that Order.

1. Equality of Service/Open Season

   Pipelines that offer open-access transportation service must provide tho=
se
services on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas suppliers, whether=
=20
the
gas is purchased from the pipeline or from another seller. Section=20
284.14(b)(iv)
of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.14(b)(iv), requires a=20
pipeline's
tariff to reflect the principle of equality of service for all gas transpor=
ted
under each rate schedule.

   Texas-Ohio performs only unbundled transportation service; it does not
provide pipeline sales service. Texas-Ohio does, however, provide=20
transportation
service for its affiliated marketers, TOG and Texas-Ohio West, Inc. Origina=
l
Sheet No. 6, section 3.2, of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff provides that
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 7
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *15

customers with an already executed firm transportation contract for service=
 on
the Hunter Pipeline as of the effective date of the tariff shall have a=20
priority
over customers executing a service agreement at a later date. Service is
otherwise offered on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that this
provision gives preferential treatment to selected customers. It is unduly
discriminatory and must be [*16]  removed from the tariff. Further, we find=
=20
that
Texas-Ohio has never held an open-season or otherwise provided for the
non-discriminatory allocation of system capacity prior to initiating servic=
e.
Accordingly, we hold that Texas-Ohio must implement an open season within 3=
0
days of the date of issuance of an order in this proceeding to ensure non-
discriminatory allocation of system capacity.

2. Pregranted Abandonment and Right of First Refusal

   Section 284.221(d) of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.221(d)=
,
authorizes pregranted abandonment of interruptible and short-term firm
transportation at the end of the contract. A short-term contract is one wit=
h a
term of less than one year. For long-term transportation with a term of mor=
e
than a year, section 284.14(b)(1)(xiii) requires the pipeline to establish=
=20
right
of first refusal procedures for use upon expiration of the long-term contra=
ct.
Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff does not comply with these requirements; it i=
s
directed to amend its tariff accordingly.

3. Capacity Release and Electronic Bulletin Board

   Section 284.243 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.243,=20
requires
interstate pipelines offering firm transportation [*17]  to establish a=20
capacity
release mechanism that allows firm shippers to release all or part of their=
=20
firm
transportation capacity rights to any person who wants to obtain that capac=
ity
by contracting with the pipeline. The release may be temporary, permanent, =
or
subject to conditions (i.e., on an interruptible basis). The pipeline must
allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate (not ove=
r=20
the
maximum rate) and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the
release.

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to provide timely and equal access to a=
ny
and all information necessary for buyers and sellers to arrange gas sales a=
nd
capacity release, including information regarding the availability of capac=
ity
at receipt and delivery points, and whether capacity is available from the
pipeline directly or through capacity releasing. This information must be=
=20
posted
on an electronic bulletin board (EBB).

   Texas-Ohio's proposed tariff lacks these provisions. It must amend its p=
ro
forma tariff to provide a capacity release mechanism and establish an EBB.

4. Upstream Capacity

Section 284.242 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.242, provide=
s
that an interstate [*18]  pipeline that offers transportation service on a=
=20
firm
basis under subparts B or G of Part 284 must offer, without undue
discrimination, to assign to its firm shippers its firm transportation=20
capacity,
including contract storage, on all upstream pipelines. Texas-Ohio does not
appear to hold any upstream capacity. In the tariff filing it is required t=
o
make to comply with the requirements of Order No. 636, Texas-Ohio should st=
ate
whether it holds any capacity on upstream pipelines. If it does, Texas-Ohio=
=20
must
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 8
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *18

revise its tariff to comply with Order No. 636.

5. Transition Costs

   Texas-Ohio's filing predates Order No. 636 and consequently makes no=20
comment
regarding incurrence of transition costs. Accordingly, we will not make a
determination at this time with respect to Texas-Ohio's level of transition
costs. III. Docket No. MT94-2-000 Pursuant to our order of December 23, 199=
3,
Texas-Ohio filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. MT94-2-000 to comply w=
ith
the requirements of section 250.16(b), 18 C.F.R. 250.16(b). n13 With the
exception of the items discussed below, we find that Texas-Ohio's filing
complies with those requirements. n14

   n13 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,387 (1993). Section 250.16 of =
the
Commission's regulations requires interstate natural gas pipelines that
transport natural gas for others pursuant to subparts B, G, H, or K of Part=
=20
284,
and that are affiliated in any way with a natural gas marketing or brokerin=
g
entity, to file certain information relevant to that relationship.

   n14 On June 17, 1994, Order No. 566 modified section 250.16(b) effective
August 1, 1994 by, among other things, eliminating the requirement that
pipelines (1) receive certain information from shippers in requests for
transportation service, (2) log and post on the EBB complaints made by=20
shippers,
and (3) include procedures to communicate pricing and capacity information.
 [*19]

   The tariff sheets filed by Texas-Ohio do not set forth the information
required to be filed in a transportation request. Texas-Ohio contends that=
=20
since
it is operating under a temporary certificate and is prohibited from provid=
ing
transportation service to new customers pending further action on its
application, that information is not applicable.

   While Order No. 566 eliminated certain information previously required t=
o=20
be
provided in the transportation request form, it still requires pipelines to
maintain a log of data used to allocate capacity. Texas-Ohio must comply wi=
th
this provision and file a transportation request form as specified.

   Texas-Ohio can address this deficiency by either revising existing tarif=
f
provisions, including its FTS and ITS request form, or by incorporating the
changes into Section 16 (Order No. 497 Compliance Procedures) of its propos=
ed
tariff. Texas-Ohio must make a compliance filing within 45 days of the=20
issuance
of this order incorporating all information required by Order Nos. 497 and=
=20
566.
Additionally, since the tariff sheets Texas-Ohio filed in Docket No.=20
MT94-2-000
are not pro forma, Texas-Ohio should filed corrected tariff sheets in a for=
m
[*20]  acceptable to become effective upon issuance of an order in this
proceeding.

IV.Environmental Matters

   On August 22, 1990, Texas-Ohio notified the Commission that it intended =
to
commence construction of the Hunter Pipeline and that the facilities would =
be
used for the transportation of natural gas under NGPA section 311(a)(2). Th=
is
notice provided the environmental information required by section 157.206(d=
)=20
of
the Commission's regulations.

=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 9
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *20

   To ensure that operation of the Hunter Pipeline compressors complies wit=
h=20
the
noise requirements of section 157.206(d)(5), Texas-Ohio must perform a
post-construction sound survey of the compressor station. This survey must =
be
performed not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of this order. =
n15
Texas-Ohio's application for a Part 157, subpart A certificate to operate t=
he
Hunter Pipeline and a Part 284, subpart G blanket transportation certificat=
e
relies solely on the use of existing facilities; no additional construction
authorization is requested or granted. Accordingly, subject to Texas-Ohio's
compliance with section 157.206(d)(5), we conclude that approval of the=20
instant
application is not a major Federal action significantly affecting [*21]  th=
e
quality of the human environment.

   n15 Section 157.206(d)(5) provides that the noise attributable to any
compressor facility shall not exceed a day-night sound level of 55 dB(A) at=
=20
any
existing noise-sensitive areas.V. IESCO's Protest

   In its protest and request for an evidentiary hearing, IESCO charges tha=
t
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status must be determined as a precondition to =
the
issuance of a certificate.

   IESCO states that if Texas-Ohio was not a interstate pipeline for the=20
period
from November 1990 through June 3, 1991, it could not legally offer NGPA=20
section
311(a)(2) service and competing sellers of gas (such as IESCO) could have b=
een
unfairly deprived of their markets.

   The Commission's January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary
certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline laid to rest concerns regarding
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status. Further, Texas-Ohio agreed in the=20
settlement
approved in the Commission's October 18, 1993, order to comply with the NGA=
,
NGPA, and the Commission's regulations. This order issues Texas-Ohio a case=
-
specific certificate pursuant to subpart A of Part 157 and a blanket
transportation certificate pursuant to subpart G of [*22]  Part 284. No
questions remain as to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio.

   IESCO then complains that Texas-Ohio should have held an open-season dur=
ing
which prospective shippers would have an opportunity to obtain services on =
the
Hunter Pipeline. As discussed above, the Commission has investigated
Texas-Ohio's operation and determined, among other things, that Texas-Ohio
notified only its marketing affiliate and the marketing affiliate's custome=
rs=20
of
the availability of capacity prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline. =
The
Commission's policies require Texas-Ohio to use a non-discriminatory method=
 of
selecting customers for both firm and interruptible transportation service=
=20
when
operating under Part 284. n16 As noted above, we are holding that Texas-Ohi=
o
must hold an open season prior to commencing service under its Part 284=20
blanket
certificate. This approach will ensure that prior notice of firm capacity i=
s
made available to all interested parties on a contemporaneous basis and in =
a
non-discriminatory manner. n17

   n16 18 C.F.R. 284.8(b) and 284.9(b).

   n17 See, e.g., Pacific Gas Transmission Co., 54 FERC 61.035 at 61,154=20
(1991);
ANR Storage Co., 51 FERC 61,114 at 61.304 (1990). [*23]

   IESCO next asserts that Texas-Ohio's proposed tariff does not assure tha=
t
nondiscriminatory service will be provided. We disagree. Acceptance by
=0F,                                                                       =

Texas-Ohio of the blanket transportation certificate authorized by this ord=
er,
and as conditioned herein, will subject Texas-Ohio to the full range of the
Commission's requirements, including those prohibiting discriminatory=20
practices.

   IESCO states that Texas-Ohio must be required to comply with the provisi=
ons
of the Affiliated Marketer Rule. As we noted in the order issuing a tempora=
ry
certificate, Order Nos. 497 and 497-A apply to all interstate pipelines wit=
h
affiliated marketers. Upon acceptance of the temporary certificate Texas- O=
hio
became subject to the conditions of those orders. n18 Texas-Ohio's standard=
s=20
of
conduct implementing Order No. 497, filed in Docket No. MG93-5-000, have be=
en
accepted by the Commission. n19 When Texas-Ohio complies with this order's
directions, Texas-Ohio will be in full compliance with Order No. 497.

   n19 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,387 (1993); Texas- Ohio Pipeli=
ne,
Inc., 67 FERC 61,149 (1994). [*24]

   IESCO asserts that Texas-Ohio's proposed rates have not been shown to be
required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. It is
particularly concerned with the fact that Texas-Ohio seeks to depreciate it=
s
facilities over a ten-year period. As discussed above, we agree that
Texas-Ohio's proposed rates and ten-year depreciation period are=20
inappropriate,
and we have required adjustments to those figures as appropriate.

   IESCO also raises in its protest issues relating to Texas- Ohio's=20
application
for a temporary certificate. Those issues were addressed in our January 15,=
=20
1992
order issuing a temporary certificate. Issues raised by IESCO on rehearing =
of
that order are discussed below.

   In view of our disposition of the issues raised by IESCO, we find that=
=20
there
are no disputed material issues of fact and, therefore, no need for an
evidentiary trial-type hearing. n20

   n20 See Arkla Gathering Services Co., 67 FERC 61,257 (1994).VI. Request =
for
Rehearing

   On February 14, 1992, IESCO filed a request for rehearing of the=20
Commission's
January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary certificate. IESCO
contends first that issuance of the temporary [*25]  certificate to Texas-O=
hio
was unlawful on three grounds: (1) the Commission acted beyond its statutor=
y
authority because it improperly determined that an emergency existed; (2) e=
ven
if an emergency existed, the Commission failed to make adequate findings
supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the Commission failed to resolve
jurisdictional and tariff issues in connection with issuance of the tempora=
ry
certificate.

   NGA section 7(c)(1)(B) provides that "the Commission may issue a tempora=
ry
certificate in cases of emergency, to assure maintenance of adequate servic=
e=20
or
to serve particular customers without notice or hearing, pending the
determination of an application for a [permanent] certificate . . . ." The=
=20
order
issuing a temporary certificate expressly found that an emergency exists=20
within
the meaning of section 7(c)(1)(B) of the Natural Gas Act and section 157.17=
 of
the Commission's regulations, and that the public convenience and necessity
required the issuance of a temporary certificate authorizing Texas-Ohio's
=0F,                                                                       =
 =20

                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *25

operation of the Hunter Pipeline in order to continue service to existing
customers who had been relying on that service. n21 In support thereof, the
order referenced [*26]  the fact that: (1) Raritan River Steel Company, the
largest employer in Perth Amboy, New Jersey would be forced to purchase gas=
=20
at a
higher price and might have to close its plant with disastrous impacts on t=
he
community; and (2) a number of entities, including the Philadelphia Housing
Authority, the Dartmouth Finishing Corporation, and various schools indicat=
ed
that they are operating under strained budgets and that the inability to
transport gas on Texas-Ohio would result in severe fiscal restraints.

   n21 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,059 (1992).

   Under these circumstances, we believe that an emergency situation was sh=
own
to exist within the standard established by NGA section 7 and that this
conclusion is appropriately supported by the evidence relied upon in the=20
order.
n22

   n22 See generally, Penn-York Energy Corp., 37 FERC 61,109 (1986);
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 34 FERC 61,402 (1986).

   With regard to its assertion that the Commission failed to resolve certa=
in
jurisdictional and tariff issues prior to the issuance of the temporary
certificate, IESCO complains that:  [*27]  (i) the Commission issued a=20
temporary
certificate without making a finding that Texas-Ohio is a "natural gas=20
company"
subject to the Commission's NGA jurisdiction; (ii) the failure to resolve t=
he
jurisdictional issue leaves unresolved the question of whether a certificat=
e=20
of
public convenience and necessity is needed for the construction of the Hunt=
er
Pipeline; and (iii) the Commission has left unresolved the question of whet=
her
an open-season is required to assure non-discriminatory access to Texas-Ohi=
o's
facility, thus precluding shippers who were denied service from any=20
opportunity
to obtain service during the period that the temporary certificate is in=20
effect.

   IESCO's arguments misapprehend the function of a temporary certificate. =
By
its very nature, issuance of a temporary certificate precedes decisions on
matters related to issuance of the permanent certificate. The issues raised=
 by
IESCO are appropriate for decision in connection with the issuance of a
permanent certificate and we have addressed them above. n23

   n23 We in fact noted in the January 15, 1992 order that the issues raise=
d=20
by
IESCO relating to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio and the provision=
 of
service on a nondiscriminatory basis would be resolved upon consideration o=
f=20
the
application for a permanent certificate. We stressed at that time that "the
grant of a temporary certificate is made to allow the resumption of service=
 by
specific customers previously utilizing Texas-Ohio's facilities to prevent
hardship." Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,060 (1992). [*28=
]

   IESCO also asserts that the Commission improperly refused to order an
evidentiary hearing before issuing the temporary certificate. IESCO alleges=
=20
that
efforts in Docket No. PR91-5-000 to determine the original and ultimate
destination of gas transported by Texas-Ohio were unsuccessful. It also sta=
tes
that the proceedings in Docket No. PR91-5-000 and the instant docket have b=
een
plagued by uncertainty over the identity of Texas- Ohio's customers and the
nature of the services rendered.

   We disagree that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the issuan=
ce=20
of
=0F,                                                                       =

the temporary certificate. NGA section 7(c) does not require either notice =
or
hearings in conjunction with the issuance of a temporary certificate. Even=
=20
where
the statute requires an evidentiary, trial-type hearing, it is necessary on=
ly
where material issues of fact are in dispute that cannot be resolved on the
basis of the written record. n24 The matters raised by IESCO are speculativ=
e=20
or
immaterial to the decision to issue a temporary certificate to allow the
resumption of specific services to specific customers. Finally, IESCO alleg=
es
that the Commission failed to attach conditions needed to prevent abuse of =
the
temporary [*29]  certificate. IESCO states that the temporary certificate=
=20
should
have been expressly limited to serving customers previously served through =
the
Hunter Pipeline and that it should have included a condition for potential
refunds.

   n24 Arkla Gathering Service Co., 67 FERC 61,257 (1994).

   Our January 15, 1992 order specifically provided that the temporary
certificate is not a blanket authorization, but is limited to only those
customers with whom Texas-Ohio has existing transportation agreements. n25 =
The
order further specified that the grant of a temporary certificate is made t=

   Pro Forma Tariff Analysis: Specific Comments

1. Rate Schedules FTS and/or ITS

   Section 1 - Availability

In this section, Texas-Ohio reserves the right, in its sole judgement=20
(exercised
on a reasonable [*32]  and non-discriminatory basis) to decline service=20
whenever
it would be contrary to good operational practices or detrimental to other
customers. Texas- Ohio should revise this section to set out the specific
criteria or detrimental actions that would trigger this clause.

   Section 1.(iii) of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provi=

Texas-Ohio with "acceptable" evidence of, among other things, gas supply,
market, and other transportation services. The term "acceptable" is vague a=
nd
subject to unduly discriminatory interpretation. Texas-Ohio must set forth
specifically the evidence required to be "acceptable".

   Section 2- Applicability and Character of Service

Section 2.4 of Rate Schedule ITS states that transportation will be "subjec=

The
provision is vague and could result in unduly discriminatory application of
curtailment procedures. Texas-Ohio must modify the provision to detail the
specific operational characteristics and criteria used to determine the
conditions and need for curtailment.

Section 3.2 of Rate Schedule  [*33]  FTS provides for firm service on a fir=
st
come, first served basis. However, Texas-Ohio retains a priority for custom=
ers
with existing FTS agreements. This provision is unduly discriminatory and m=

   Section 3.4 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio can curtail=20
service
due to reasons of force majeure "or any other operational considerations to=

ic
operational considerations it would rely upon in exercising this authority.

   In Section 3.5 of Rate Schedule FTS and Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule ITS=

Texas-Ohio proposes to suspend service if a shipper's account is unpaid for=

   Section 4 - Requests for Transportation

Section 4.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS states that a shipper must comple=
te=20
a
FTS or ITS Request Form; however, no request  [*34]  form is included.
Texas-Ohio must establish a request form as part of its tariff. That form m=

250.16(b)
of the Commission's regulations.

   Section 5 - Operating Conditions

Section 5.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provide
Texas-Ohio with estimates of gas to be transported and such other operating=
=20
data
as Texas-Ohio may require. This section should be amended to specify what=

other
operating data may be required of shippers.

   Section 5.4 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS specifies that Texas-Ohio will=

provide service on any day for which all necessary upstream and downstream
arrangements cannot be confirmed. This clause should be amended to state th=
at
any action will be taken on a non-discriminatory basis.

   Section 6 - Rates

Section 6.2 of Rate Schedule FTS defines the monthly reservation and commod=
ity
(usage) charge. Texas-Ohio should insert the word "maximum" in the second
sentence prior to "monthly commodity charge" and "unit commodity rate(s)".

   Section 9 - Waivers

Section 9 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio may waive any right=

the discretion to waive default by the shipper of any provision in the tari=

This would give Texas-Ohio excessive latitude in operating under its tariff=

and

Pipelines are permitted, but not required, to impose penalties to maintain

Please advise.

Marlene,  I am not sure what you are asking me to do.  If these contracts are 
active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking 
system for these types of services contracts (transport, pooling, etc.).  If 
they are not active and are of no value, then they probably should not be put 
into the database.  However, this is not a legal question, but a business 
question.  If the business decision is made that they are of no value and 
inactive, then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms. 

Let me know if I am missing the point of your question.  If I am not, then I 
will return these contracts to you.

Once completed, please forward the spreadsheet back to Sylvia Campos.

Dan and Teresa,  Attached is the form of declaration of Managing Member under 
which Crescendo appoints ENA to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with 
Wildhorse.  Please review.  

Teresa,  Do you think we need to get the Class B member approval also for 
this appointment of ENA as representative?  The LLC Agreement is open with 
respect to the Managing Member delegating its duties.

Dan or Ward,  Please note that the Crescendo LLC Agreement Section 6.3 
indicates that if the Managing Member request the Class C Member (Enron) to 
provide certain financial or technical services, then Class C Member may do 
so for market based rates.  Is it the intention that Enron be reimbursed for 
any commercial or engineering services it provides to the LLC such as 
negotiating with Wildhorse or Project Management of the Plant Construction?

Bill, 
I have revised the following to reflect what we discussed today. 

As an afterthought the only additional thing I would like to change is Item # 
1 to reflect minimum of twice or as deemed appropriate such as after a bad 
storm or when unauthorized "visitors" are reported at the site.

The following is a list of services for Texaco Pipelines LLC to monitor the 
leaching of
the new cavern:

A fixed fee of $1,800 per month, invoiced monthly, will provide
Enron with the following services:
1. Visual and physical inspection of the pump, wellhead, and associated
equipment (minimum twice in 24 hours or as deemed appropriate)
2. Pump pad oil as required
3. Backwash well twice a week
4. Communicate/coordinate with DOW on fresh water supply and brine
delivery
5. Routine maintenance and troubleshooting on well and associated
equipment (e.g. turbine meters, valve actuators, etc.)
6. Monitor sump area to avoid overflow
7. Write 3rd party work permits for any contract work being done on the
pump and well area
8. Start and stop fresh water booster pump as needed
9. Block in well in preparation for well logging
10. Obtain monthly electrical meter readings for Enron to verify direct
billing from Coastal Corp. to Enron.
11. Maintain files on well data
12. Forward Enron invoices to Enron in Houston.

For any maintenance activities, special projects, or other service requests
that extend beyond the 2 hours/day covered in the monthly fixed fee, Texaco
Pipelines LLC will invoice at $30/hour.  For contract services or materials
purchased by Texaco Pipelines LLC on behalf of Enron, Texaco will invoice
Enron at cost plus 15%.

Dick Danes met some time ago with Exxon field personnel concerning this 
well.  They have now indicated that they have a good well and would like to 
be in service by August 15.  I have spoken with the Exxon commercial contact, 
Bill Nicus, and he indicated that they would like to site the meter station 
at the commonpoint and lay a 4" to HPL.  Dick is picking up a plat @Robstown 
office today that reflects where Exxon would like to tie into HPL.  Can we 
let Exxon install meter to our specs and pipeline and let us operate but they 
own?  We can tap our line and install riser for line to tie in.  I can get 
thruput commitment to pay out our investment in tap/riser.  I would prefer to 
let them bear costs and ownership with HPL doing measurement.   We will 
retain ownership of the tap/riser.  

Steve Vanhooser is out but has assigned this project to Gerald Nemec.  By

Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege

Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse 
concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota 
production is committed.  Please review and provide comments.

To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:

1.  Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.  Brett also 
forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The 
correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings 
conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and 
no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the 
Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because 
the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.  
Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or 
Questar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release 
the gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo 
negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.  

2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really 
useful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area 
called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought 
these assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately 
this letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that 
position with Wildhorse.

3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.  I want someone intimately 
familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective 
to be involved.  We may need to seek a declaratory order.   We have run into 
to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown.  
Should have this resolved on Monday.

4.  Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the 
declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.  

This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to 
reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right 
to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.  The fact that 
the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, 
allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in 
default. 

Joan,  The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from 
Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.  Per Brett Frie at 
Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.  Until the plant is up and 
running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.  I am 
not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant?  

The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no 
facts about the gas quality of this gas.  You had forwarded emails last week 
indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream 
of Wildhorse's plant.  Once we have these facts we can send a letter 
concerning the Dakota.  Do you have any info on these samples?

	Joan Quick
	07/24/2000 07:17 PM
		
Per the drafts, we are asking "Wildhorse to accept all gas delivered.... upon 
startup of the Treating Plant."   I thought the purpose of this letter was to 
get Wildhorse to take all of our gas right now, not just after the plant is 
started up.  Is this not so?   I agree with Dan, that  this letter only 
discusses the Entrada gas, with no mention of the Dakota curtailment, which I 
think it should.

I had just a couple minor changes...

Gerald --

I have provided a few coments (redlined) to your draft letter attached below.

However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and 
the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter:

 A.  Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the 
shut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification 
related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, 
Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have 
any historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims].

 B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment 
of Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure 
requirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system 
pressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse 
over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the 
NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased 
pressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these 
problems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 "Gas Quality" of the agreement, 
what remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?].

Here's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and 
the documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach 
non-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to 
increase gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of 
this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.  Then, they use 
the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive 
producers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and 
quality issues discussed above.  Therefore, its critical that this letter 
gets to the "right" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference 
to some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable 
manner, etc.). 

Thanks.

Dan

Tomorrow at noon sounds good.  I have primarily been working on Denver 
stuff.  Although a new project up in Denver.  One that I wish I hadn't gotten

Hi.  Recovery is taking longer than I thought.  I've read all my mail, and 
washed all my clothes but I still owe quite a few people phone calls (long 
distance friends who called while I was away).  I was able to get some stuff 
done at work on Sunday but probably need to come in again this weekend.  I 
just feel unmotivated -- so need to hit the gym next week and will probably 
feel a lot  better.  

Lunch tomorrow sounds good -- noon downstairs?  

Are you still working on Colorado stuff or is something else keeping you busy?

My thought is just to take all this language out and solely leave us on out 
if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent 
Agreement.  Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue 
up.

to elect to take transport....at what price........since producer must pay 
the price under the contract price formula....we may need to be willing to 
agree on a range of acceptable prices...........this would also help define 
reasonale efforts...........................your thoughts please   bng

Susan,  Attached are redlined copies of the CSA Amendments.  We made a change 
to the Monthly Contract Quantity to exclude Force Majeure events and Section 
2.4 Shaft energy interruptions.  Please review and call me with any 
questions.  x-33512.

Since we have circulated the prior amendment, I think it would avoid the most 
confusing by giving these amendments a new execution date.  I also added a 
section which specifices that these versions replace the amendments dated 
June 18, 1999.

The NBV letter values will also be redone.  The numbers will have to be 
changed.  The investors have asked that instead of a Contract Year Schedule, 
a quarterly schedule be included.   I don't have the numbers from Mark yet, 
but will forward those changes as soons as I get them.

Mark indicated that he had discussed these changes with both you and David.

Attached is the latest version of the Wildhorse Entrada Letter.  Please 
review.  I reviewed the letter with Jim Osborne and Ken Krisa yesterday and 
should get their comments today.  My plan is to Fedex to Midland for Ken's 
signature tomorrow morning and from there it will got to Wildhorse.  

 

Please review.  Thanks.

Heinifer,

A few corrections:  Jeff and Cathy call each other "boo" not "pooh".  
Secondly, with your threats of my arse being kicked, I must say that violence 
solves nothing, but if you wanna dance tonight, bring it on.  Third, it is 
not a "supposed" conference call just because you didn't plan it or have the 
idea, IT IS A GO!  Fourthly, & oh yes Fourthly is a word, anyone who wants to 
can "present"  their ideas & suggestions  (or demands if your a Nazi) on the 
conference call.

Lastly, 
I can't wait to get drunk in a foreign country with all of you.

By the way, on this supposed conference call, who all is presenting
information?

It'll be too cold and I'll complain about being cold the whole time. Plus,
it's not as interesting as Spain. Matt, you could wear cute little

What's the problem with Germans?  I tend to like them . . . very strong

AND, I would like to wear some of those little shorts that have

Attached is the final version of the CSA.  Let me know if you need an 
executed hard copy.

Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals 
docs, per your voicemail.

Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you 
earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now 
having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well. 

 Let me know if you need anything else.

Ken,  Attached is the letter.  Please sign and forward the original to Kent 
Harris via Fedex.  We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and 
a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files.

The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.  Not sure if you had stationary 
for Crescendo yet.

Send a signed copy to me  and I will copy all the Enron CCs.

please let me know if there are any issues with us stating the prepay in this

 - Wildhorse 7-28-00.doc

Attached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on 
my discussions with Chris last week.  These have been only redlined against 
the prior version, not the original versions.  Let me know if you want 
redlines against the original docs.  The LLC was not included as no changes 
were made from the versions already forwarded.

With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures. The Administrative 
Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such 
cashout.  It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure 
at any time.  If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make 
the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of 
procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to 
work out the bugs.  Scott Sitter will be developing this draft.  The 
development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions.  
A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members 
upon development of those final procedures.

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

I will be out the 17th and 18th.

Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure 
is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the 
contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data?  
Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.  

Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks 
for your help.

Ken,  Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data 
on Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the 
Gathering Agreement?  I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any 
such data.  Thanks.

Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will 
create executables.  Thanks.

Attached is the revised amendment.

Dan,  Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.  As 
the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as 
follows:

1.  Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment.
 If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to 
Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.  You are right, there is no 
time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives.  
That is a risk I pointed out early.  However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I 
proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.  If Wildhorse is not 
working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we 
will have to make a choice:
  A.  Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the 
contract.  This will take time.  Depending on court docket loads, 6 months   
to 1 year.

  B.  Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within 
a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in   good faith 
and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we 
will build our own system.  Then Crescendo would   build its own system and 
risk a suit by Wildhorse. 

2.  Not declare Unprofitability
 If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation 
under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.  The only 
complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the 
gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate 
gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, 
Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your 
field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better 
understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare 
unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be 
able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant.

If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss 
renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them "under what 
provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate 
any fees?".  They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract 
without unprofitability.

I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met with 
the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard. 

1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up 
with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al) 
currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin.

2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (and 
other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity 
for Wildhorse.

3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the 
Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development 
ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very 
familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on 
to Ken/Jim).

4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for the 
past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder 
Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in their 
LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now 
being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are 
successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look 
to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to 
third party purchasers.

This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard 
to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been 
slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 
above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to 
Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of 
the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction 
between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their 
transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of 
course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they 
would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI 
negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the 
system is divested?

The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to 
Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time 
deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in 
writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the 
event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? 

I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of 
any developments.

Thanks.

Gerald, here are some things to think about before our meeting.  EDG

HPL's intent for initiating EOL service:

Sell interruptible transport in stated volume increments
Develop daily, weekly and monthly markets in transport that parallel the 
Texas desk business (price the transportation service required to supply a 
peaking deal or a week day only deal.)

Proposed EOL language by Steve Hotte with Northern's IT group. He is the lead 
on this project from an EOL perspective

A transaction under which the specified Enron natural gas pipeline will 
transport, on an interruptible basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu 
per day) equal to the volume identified on the website.  The gas will be 
transported from the specified receipt point(s) to the specified delivery 
point(s).  The bid and offer rates are stated as one-part rates in $(US) per 
MMBtu.  If a transaction is consummated, the shipper will be billed the 
one-part rate, which is inclusive of all applicable surcharges, based on 
usage.  In addition, the shipper will be billed the applicable charge for 
fuel.  The term of the transaction will correspond to the dates shown on the 
website.

Additional considerations for HPL's participation, EOL language and GTC (?) 
language.

HPL needs a two part rate, the first part to be billed regardless of use (a 
demand charge).   Colleen suggested a very small charge ($.0025/MMBtu) to 
keep counterparties from buying capacity and leaving us high and dry.  The 
second part is the total rate less the demand charge that will be billed on a 
commodity basis.  The rate billed will never be larger than the rate 
transacted on EOL.

HPL will not have a bid at this time.  Theoretically, HPL owns all the 
interruptible transportation capacity and it would be purchasing capcity from 
itself.  In short, HPL will not be showing bids.

Points will really be market zones with well defined pipeline points within 
them.  Bouncing between points (as capacity at each point allows) will be 
permitted as long as the shipper continues to utilize the path purchased.

The transaction is good for the time purchased, if there is a break in the 
shipper's use during the transaction, the capcity must be renegotiated, in 
any event the demand charge will be billed for the full term of the 
transaction.

There have been many inquiries about Gabrielle, so I thought I would give 
everybody an update.  Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good.  She has had 
many complications since the surgery (chest fluid, blood clots, infections, 
and fluctuating blood pressure due to high blood acidity).  For the past 24 
hours, she has been relatively stable, but no improvements.  She is still in 
ICU and it could still go either way.  

When Jim's 2 1/2 year old son, Connor, visited Gabrielle on Monday, he looked 
at Jim and said "Gabrielle wants to go home."  Please keep her in your 
prayers.  

Thank you,
Dina

Susan,  Attached are the letter agreements between ECS and TW which cover the 
earlier letters I sent.

Attached is a rough draft of the agreement we discussed last week.  Please 
review and let's discuss.

Mark,  Attached is their proposed language.

	Eva Neufeld@ENRON
	08/10/2000 02:37 PM
		 
Gerald,

I received your voice-mail regarding the LOU.  

Paul Miller requested that I add some definition to the term "I-80 
corridor".  The following is my language for that.  

"(ii) any gas transportation pipeline or transmission system in the I-80 
corridor, which corridor is defined as being three (3) miles wide on each 
side of I-80,"

Paul also left me a garbled voice mail regarding another point related to the 
Participation Rights section.  I haven't been able to reach him to get 
clarification on that.  I don't know whether this will turn out to be a 
revision or not at this time.

As you mentioned there may be revisions required in the "Employee Matters" 
section to comport with the offer of employment that will actually take place.

I am sending hard copies.  I can't find the electronic version. 

	"Sean Bunk" <BUNKS@andrews-kurth.com>
	08/09/2000 09:58 AM
		 
Gerald,

Could you please send or email me copies of:
  (i) the Guaranty, dated as of 12/17/98 by Enron Corp. in favor of Lost 
Creek, and
  (ii) the Guaranty, dated as of 12/17/98 by BR in favor of Lost Creek
so that I can prepare the Guaranty Terminations to be executed in connection 
with the conversion.  Thanks.

Please call me at (713) 220-4427 if you have any questions.

Sean

Mark,  Please review and lets discuss.

How is it going?  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  It has been pretty busy 
around here.  Trying to sell all these nasty assets.  I am leaving for your 
homeland, Denver to experience the Rocky Mountain high for myself.  Just what 
the hell was John Denver singing about anyway?  Let me know what's going on.  

Hi Emmye,  Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  It has been 
extremely busy here at work and I am leaving for Denver today at 5:30 so I am 
really having to hustle to get things done before I leave.  How was the 
wedding?  I know you really were just looking for any excuse to go to Tomball.

I too had fun on Thursday.  I will give you a call when I get back from 
Denver. I will be back on Sunday.  Take care and talk to you soon.

Gerald  

Mark,  Attached are the latest revisions to the participation language.  
Please review and if everything looks acceptable, forward to NBP.

Nick,  Do you have an electronic version you could send me?

Chris,  Attached is the revised Work Offer.  Please forward to Hanover for 
execution.

Made a few slight changes to correct company's name.

Attached is a redline of the Bisti Assigment documents showing the latest 
revision.  The sames changes have been made in all 4 assigments.

Also attached is the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement with Confirms and 
Redlines of the Confirms to show the lastest changes.

Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you have any questions

Since Eric is a contract employee, he was not included as part of the formal 
PRC process recently completed.  Therefore we would like to receive feedback 
from you concerning Eric's performance outside the performance management 
system.  I will be forwarding a hard copy Performance Evaluation form for 
your input.  You may either hand write or email the information back to me.  
Whichever is easier for you.  Please take time out of your busy schedules to 
complete the forms as soon as possible.  I would like to have a response by 
Aug. 24th.  Thank you for your time.

Jessica,  Attached are the Agreement for both Suzanne and Diane.  The form 
also refers to a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement that both 
Suzanne and Diane must execute.  I have a call in to Michelle about those 
forms.  I will forward as soon as I get them.  We can go ahead though and 
forward these agreements to MTM.

Attached for your review is a draft of the Lost Creek - ENA IT Agreement.  
Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.  Some 
provision (nominations, imbalances)  are taken from the North Central 
Agreement since BR is familiar with that form.

Eric, Need your help on this.  Let's get a copy of the grazing lease that 
Candy is referring to in the E-mail.  I am not clear on what she means by 
having Merl operate the well.  I think she means allow him to graze this area 
under the terms of his existing lease, but I am not sure.  Can you get with 
Candy on this?  Thanks.

	Candace L Bywaters

Nathan tells me that he has a request in to you for a dollar evaluation of 
the Hamill Gas Unit #1 water well that EOG recently assigned and conveyed 
over to HPL at my request.  Please advise me at your earliest convenience 
what that value may be so that we can appropriately get it on our asset 
ledger.  I am also awaiting a response from John Towles as to a clearer plat 
on this property as was originally requested by EOG some time ago which I 
assume we will use as an exhibit to the Operating Agreement..

Also, by copy hereof, I ask that Gerald or his designee prepare an Operating 
Agreement between HPL and Merl Vanek whereby Merl will be entitled to operate 
this well for purposes of his grazing lease at this facility.  HPL desires 
that Merl operate this well at his sole cost and expense and maintain it in 
good working order.  We can make the term of this Operating Agreement 
coterminous with his grazing lease which is established under an October 1, 
1998 Grazing Lease with an original term of one year from that date and 
year-to-year thereafter unless sooner terminated by at least 90 days' advance 
written notice prior to the end of the original term or any renewal term 
thereafter by one party to the other.  Merl's address is 2634 Milroy Lane, 
Houston, TX  77088 with a phone number of 281-444-8689 and a fax number of 
281-587-4200.  I have already advised Merl of the effective ownership of this 
well by HPL and he will be operating it accordingly as his need to do so is 
urgent, so I request that this document be prepared as soon as possible in 
consideration of HPL's liability.

Thanks to all for your help on this.

Jessica,  Attached are the Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreements.  
There is one for Suzanne Badeaux, Diane Allen, and MTM Temps.   Let me know 
if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working

site for the purposes of load controlling the Gallup Station to avoid 
Tri-State's system peaks.  Attached is a confidentiality agreement which 
Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see

have attached a clean and a redlined of my comments.  I thought we could get 
both of our comments prior to sending back to Tri-State.  Please review and

As part of the original Kennedy deal, we purchased some gathering lines from

signatures, accordingly.  If it cannot be ready today, I will contact Sandra 
Grimes and John Lopez and inform them that it will be ready on Tuesday, 
9/5/2000.

The Oasis Pipeline Contracts are still being routed for signature.  However, 
I received this e-mail from Stacey Neuweiler to continue business as ENA not 
HPLC.

Thank You.

Marlene Hilliard
Per Tom Martin's request, please continue business as ENA, not HPLC for 
September 1,2000.  Until we know the future of Houston Pipeline, we will 
continue transacting as ENA.  Thank you very much for all of your help with 
this.

Joan,  I received a copy of this Exhibit "A" a couple of weeks back.  
Unfortunately I found the same thing you did, that all San Arroyo properties 
are dedicated.

Ken has faxed me a copy of Exhibit "A" - San Arroyo properties encumbered by 
the Gathering Agreement.  I was hoping that maybe just the Dakota, or just 
the Entrada properties were tied to this contract, but it is all the San 
Arroyo properties.

Gerald - I will give you your copy Tues am.
Mark - I will send a copy to you via interoffice mail.  I will not fax, since 
what I have is already hard to read.

This message is BS.  What's up dude?  How was the game?  Looks like Major is

HEY GUYS. IS THIS STUFF BS OR WHAT? LET ME KNOW YOUR OPINION SO I DON'T MAKE
AN ASS OUT OF MYSELF AND FORWARD THIS TO ANYONE ELSE.

GT

Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back 
without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality 
baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me. 

What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did 
your partners meet any new family members?

I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much 
more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when you 
get a chance and let me know how you are.

Take care,
Gerald.  

Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss 
the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts.

Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

Thanks,

Dave Nocera

GT,  Man you are killing me with that story of the naked blonde.  I almost 
cried for not going now.  Is she still married, because if not I want to 
propose.  

Cabo was pretty sweet.  Plenty of sun, sand, and women.  Hooked up with a 
chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.  We went 
fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.  Took a portion of it to a 
restaurant and they cooked it for us.  Awesome.  There were tons of Honeymoon 
couples down there.  You might want to check it out.  It is a short flight 
and pretty reasonably priced.  They have some great hotels as well.

I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room 
ready.  Talk at ya later.

Need  your help with an agency agreement per this email.  Let's talk about 
this one.

I've been needing to set up Crescendo/ENA into Wildhorse's system, so that 
ENA can nom the gas starting October 1st.  Part of what I need to do is set 
up an agency agreement with contact names stating that ENA will be making the 
noms on behalf of Crescendo under transport contract xx, and yy.  The 
transport contracts I have are to Questar [current Enogex transport 
contracts].  I called Becky Shulz [Wildhorse] to talk again about what all I 
need to do, and ["playing dumb"] was asking her what the NWPL contract # was 
that I needed to set up in my paperwork.  She said she would have to look at 
the map to see exactly where our wells were...to find which interconnect was 
best, but before she did that, she needed to discuss this with Kent, but more 
so to make sure that he has all the paperwork he needs, re NG assigning this 
contract to us.  Kent will be out of the office until Friday.

Noms are due in about 1.5 weeks.

Attached is the form of CA to be used for your Kern River discussion.  I can 
print executables if you need.  Let me know.

That's a good one.  This is taking on much more meaning now that she possibly 
might be a US Senator.  Yikes.

               OVER THE HILLARY
                            * * *
submitted by The Captain

Hillary Clinton and her driver were cruising along a country road one
evening
when a cow ran in front of the car.

The driver tried to avoid it but couldn't - the cow was killed.

Hillary told her driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners
what happened.

About an hour later, the driver staggered back to the car with his clothes
in
disarray.  He was holding a bottle of wine in one hand, a cigar in the other

and smiling happily.

"What happened?" asked Hillary.

"Well," the driver replied, "the farmer gave me the wine, his wife gave me
the
cigar, and their beautiful daughter made mad passionate love to me."

"My God, what did you tell them?" asked Hillary.

The driver replied: "I'm Hillary Clinton's driver, and I just killed the
cow."

Thanks for the offer.  I just have too much going on here to make it.  See ya.

This is the letter that went out.  Minor change to the last paragraph to
make it more accurate.  This will go out today.

Attached are the latest schedules and supplements.  Still waiting on the 
revised financial statements.

Attached are a clean and redline version with my changes.

This is incredible.  The kid was a life long Aggie Fan, makes one trip to 
Austin and commits to UT.  I think we have finally found the guy to win it 
all for us (MB).   Also now Chance is saying he will actively recruit for 
us.  He wants this years class to be better than last years class.  I think a 
few phone calls to Roy Williams and BJ Johnson.  I can't wait til August.  

When are you coming back guy.  Are you ready for some football?

G$,

How goes it?  So how about Mack Brown?  He still amazes me with recruiting 
prowess.  Under Mackovic, getting Mock would have been an accident, but I am 
beginning to expect these recruits to start coming to Texas now.  Help me 
keep my expectations low!

Attached for review is a redline of the latest revisions to Schedules to the 
Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Also attached are various supplements to the 
schedules.  The only items not included are the Capital Account Balances - 
Schedule 3.1(g) and the Financial Statements - Schedule 3.1(i).  Karry 
Kendall will be forwarding those shortly this evening.  

Also attached is Exhibit A-2.  This is an item description of the equipment 
included in the EMS gathering systems.  I also forwarded Exhibit D - 
Specified Geographical Area and Exhibit A-1 - Map of the EMS Gathering System 
earlier today via FEDEX.  You should have those tomorrow morning.

Hi Dee Dee

OK, It is at about this point in time when my thoughts turn to my next 
vacation.  Jeez, criminy (little Seattle lingo) have I been busy this week.  
Looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little.  No big plans but to 
enjoy the college football extravaganza on Saturday.  Maybe grill some beast 
depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas.  It has been raining 
here all week which is good, because at least it isn't 107 degrees out.  

My clients in Denver wanted a full download on all my Cabo activities.  These 
are the guys who have been to Cabo several times including the 20/20 club.  
As a matter of fact, the project I am working on right now for these guys is 
called Project 20/20.  Coincidence, I don't think so.  Anyway, when I told 
them I met this girl who went to 20/20 with me, they were very impressed.  
They now hold me in higher esteem than before.  At least that's one way to 
gain the respect of your clients.

So how is the great Northwest? Have your told grandparents about the 
wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your 
shoes.  Some details are probably better left out.    

I am about out of here.  Take care and I will talk to you later.

Gerald

Attached is the revised agreement with Utah added.  Let me know if you need 
anything else.

Attached is a redlined version of the schedules with changes for the 
sales/use taxes on EMS materials.  All other supplements to the schedules 
remain unchanged.

Eva,  All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior 
to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to 
closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

	Eva Neufeld@ENRON
	09/16/2000 03:50 PM
		 
Since theTerm Conversion won't occur prior to closing, will you be deleting 
the references to it on  3.1(d), 3.1(k), 3.1(n), 3.1(q), and 4.5?  Thanks.  
Eva.

Jere,  I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10 
million cap.  Dave and I had discussed a $2 million cap.  I would request 
that the $2 million cap be inserted.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Gerald,

Enclosed is the latest version which I understand you and David N discussed.
I understand there are changes to sections 2 and 6.  Dave asked me to send
to you in his absence.  Please let us know if this is on target.

Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules incorporating the 
comments sent by NBP this weekend and also reflecting the executed Lost Creek 
amendments.  Please review.  

Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules to the Purchase and Sale 
Agreements.  Also attached, for the sake of completeness, are the supplements 
to the schedules.  The supplements are the same as prior versions, except for 
some changes to the title defects schedules for the Maverick, Box Draw, and 
Caballo systems.  

I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined 
the whole list.  The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT 
road crossing permit to Maverick.  Also taken off were references to the 
documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was 
contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....].  That information was 
for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had 
been prepared for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Attached are clean versions of the 20/20 Schedules

I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never 
turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar 
boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  

How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This 
is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.

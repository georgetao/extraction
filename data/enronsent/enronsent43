individuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed
a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual
human life.

   You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our
lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those
were the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible.
After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the
questions: Who are we and what are we to do?

   e.e. cummings once wrote, "To be yourself in a world that is doing
its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
any human being can fight, and never stop fighting."

   I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us
say, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited
that whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would
scream out, "Praise God!" or "Hallelujah!" or "Amen!" The ushers were
so distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went
down the aisle and whispered to him: "You'll have to keep quiet? The
pastor's right in the middle of the sermon!" The Pentecostal man said,
"Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!" To which
the usher said, "Well, you didn't get it in this church!"

   The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make.
You see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And
that's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy
Spirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit
in the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd
like to put God in a box.

   Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us
and, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist
and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want
a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable
and controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is
predictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.

   We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course,
we've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine,
even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things.
But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and
spiritual life.

   For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality.
If God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.

   Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -
with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern
Western culture is the only culture in human history that has
identified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us,
"fact fundamentalists." If a statement isn't scientifically or
historically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious
mistakes and deadly to the journey inward.

   Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact
fundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire.
Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true
at all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical
factuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.

   If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is
to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of
these positions are.

   What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people
is whether they can believe "iffy" things or not. That, to most people,
is what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from
us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true.
And, if you can't believe them, then you don't "have faith" and
probably aren't a Christian.

   Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to
Self. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.

   I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.

   Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that
has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what
Jesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events
of 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian
mean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we
doing what he asks us to do?

   First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in
response to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that
sort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.

   If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story.
He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the
parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.

   "Who are you he might ask?" Then tell a story to us as we stand
there with our mouths open and scratching our heads.

   Maybe he would tell a story like this:

   One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before
the ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying,
"I'm nobody! I'm nobody!" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by
this example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. "I'm
nobody!  I'm nobody!" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't
restrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling
out, "I'm nobody! I'm nobody!" At which point the rabbi, nudging the
cantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, "Look who
thinks he's nobody!"

   I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that
one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to
convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is
interested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must
do is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against
being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be
like Jesus.

   A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was
to ask before doing any and everything, "What would Jesus do?"

   If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he
have been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he
go to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up
was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go
swimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a
Republican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political
process?

   The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this
by the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he
didn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church
has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual
dimension, neither did his mother.

   What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way
that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that
God has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God
comes down and puts arms around us and says, "This is how much I love
you. Now love yourself like that." This was the thing that marked the
ministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, "To will to be that
self which one truly is, is the opposite of despair."

   How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a
particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of
that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To
accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and
compassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where
you're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look
at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have
compassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.

   We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a
world of difference.

   Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the
stories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the
stories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he
gives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man
can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her
the gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax
collector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in
need of self-esteem and he extended it to them.

   The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the
moneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to
be kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been
known to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for
something better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion
is foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response
Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest
of life is this kind of love.

   He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall
know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going
to mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story
about Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.

   Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one
large house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept
their distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room.
Fire constantly leapt out of Water's path.

   One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of
cattle and began driving them home to their village. "Let us share
these cattle equally," said Truth as they traveled across the
grasslands. "This is the fair way to divine our captives."

   No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more
than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four
hunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water
and whispered, "You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then
there will be more cattle for each of us!"

   Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone.
Water meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for
itself.

   Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. "Look! See for yourself!
Water has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed
our warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains
to graze."

   As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to
follow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow
upwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around
rocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still
tumbling down the mountainside to this day.

   Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to
Truth and said in a loud voice, "I am more powerful than you! You will
be my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!"

   Truth rose up and spoke out, "I will not be your servant!"

   They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind
to decide who was the master.

   Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether
Truth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, "A single word
of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth." Others insisted, "Like a
small candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation."

   Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, "I have seen that
Falsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has
stopped struggling to be heard."

   And it has been that way ever since.

   I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is
that he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we
ourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that,
perhaps he would ask, "Is the story you are telling with your life the
truth?"

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

Hi Jeff, 

Yes, this interconnect will be managed by our E&C group.  Earl Chanley will be the project coordinator.  

Thanks for your quick reply.

Kim.

I got your phone message earlier this evening.  I am looking forward to meeting and working with you also.  The agreement looks fine to me.  I am assuming this project will be managed by E&C, is that correct?  If that is the case I have no comments on the payment plan.  Thanks for keeping me in the loop.

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a "Payment Plan" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks, 
Kim    713-853-3098

Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim

Has a location, Theirs or TW land/ROW, been settled and when is the required in-service date?

Thanks

Are you back in the office yet?

We've booked Italy tickets this week for departing Houston on Friday, May 24 to Newark/Rome and returning on Sunday, June 9 from Rome to Newark/Houston.  Ticket price was $1,183 per ticket. 

Paul and Judy are on board.  Can you and Tom join us?  Janell and Dennis will not be able to go anywhere in 2002 due to Janell's broken leg.

Please call me, let's discuss.

Thanks, Kim  X33098

John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  

Kim.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan

Yes, thanks.  I was aware.  I just couldn't remember if it was you or Terry.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email. The new Hotline phone number is 713-853-3044. I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation, TK was also made aware.

Here it is.  K.
See the attached spreadsheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Jan,

These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.  Are you comfortable with the difference?  Any thoughts?  No hurry, I was just wondering.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.

 

Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

thanks,
richard

Kyle,
 
Sorry for not sending this yesterday.  Monday's are always tough.  Please review and let me know what you think.  Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.
 
Thanks, Kim.
Kim,
Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday.  As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.  It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.  If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.
See you Sunday.

Let's discuss.

The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. 
The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. 
We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. 
If you have questions or issues, please let me know.

Thanks

Lorraine,

Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.  Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.

Thanks, Kim.

I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery.
It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.  
As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it.
However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station.
We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed.
I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?
Thanks

Bullets, please.

Thanks, Kim.

FYI: As you know, the CPUC had requested that TW provide copies of the responses to the earlier El Paso data request. We provided those copies to the CPUC yesterday. 

Audrey,

Would you please email me the final bullets from last week.  I don't necessarily go look for the final copy since I am the one who combines all the bullets.

Thanks, Kim. 

Lindy,

Could you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?  Tiny is trying to complete his files.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, I wasn't waiting on you.  You had provided me with a contact last year I just misplaced my note.  (Feel like we are running a race with the Devil lately and he is gaining ground.. Ha!    It's so busy....)

The Operating Agreements I know that are no longer on file include:  (This is really kind of embarassing as I know these Operating Agreements were on file when I was on the Bloomfield Team.  Someone must have discarded them...)  Anyhow,

Amaco LaPlata
Northwest Pipeline - La Plata
WFS - LaPlata
Red Cedar both La Plata and Ignacio
WFS LaMaquina
WFS Milagro - Blanco Hub
TransColorado - Blanco Hub
Burlington - Blanco Hub
NTUA - San Juan 
Citizens if there have been updates in the last five years. - Flagstaff and Kingman TBS's

I hope this is not to much trouble...   My priority for now lies with Amaco/La Plata... No hurry on any of the others..  Thank you so much
Tiny,

Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.

My apologies,

Kim.

Kim, last year you provided me with a name/contact in your group that could help me obtain Operating Agreements for customers/interconnects in our area which we curretnly do not have on file.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated with all the happenings towards the end of the year and lost the name..  Could you please send me the name so that I can proceed with the plans of setting up a Regional master file with those agreements.. Thanks

Audrey,

Here they are.  Thanks, Kim.

 

Audrey,

As a matter of practice, would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves?  I will then save it in my word file and use it to start the next weeks bullets.

Thanks, Kim.  :>)

Great, Thanks!  Kim.

Shirley, please keep me posted on Krishna's new baby.  Thanks, K.

Kim,

Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to schedule a lunch in 2-3 weeks for me and Krishna with you.
Krishna is about to become a Daddy again in a few days; the end
of August should work for him.

Vince

Vince,

I'm so glad that you can recommend him for our commercial job.  He has some skill sets that our department is shy on.  In fact, I am bringing him back for my boss, Steve Harris, to interview.  I too, think that he would be a good fit.  

By the way, Krishna and Seksan have been very helpful in coordinating some technical analysis of California prices.  We appreciate the support and certainly enjoy working with your group.  Perhaps you, Krishna and I can book a lunch together in mid to late August and catch up on the business issues.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
and he mentioned an interview with you. 

He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
be a good fit to your group. 

Vince

P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.

Jodi and Gaylen,

Please see the list below.  Would you please look at what timeframe you could get the equipment listed below.  Our preliminary investigation suggests that we may not be able to obtain the equipment quick enough to meet a May in-service date.  If your engineering department has any questions about this list, please feel free to have them call Earl Chanley at the number below.  And, of course, if you have any questions of me, please feel free to call me at (713) 853-3098.

Thanks, Kim.

Bill,  

Please check out the changes in blue.  The changes in red are from Questar.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Lynn,

I would like for you to review a draft of the proposed TW/Questar OBA in the Blanco Hub (the Interconnect Agreement is in the process of being signed and it is not built yet).  Sorry about all the "red-lines", but I think it makes it easier to see where we have made all of our changes.  FYI, the red changes are changes proposed by Questar, the blue changes are proposed by TW.  Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this agreement.

Thanks, Kim.

  

Mansoor,

I did receive the signed I/C Agreement from Questar late on Friday.  I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature.  If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date, I would definitely recommend it.  Would you please provide me your thoughts.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim

Instromat will have a 10" ultra sonic meter and calibrations ready by the end of March. I have not seen the approved PA. If this is a go, I can put a hold on this meter for Delivery to the Questar facility. Please let me know if Marketing would like to proceed on this. 

Thanks

Richard,

We are proceeding ahead with a new I/C with Questar up in the Blanco Hub, here is the proposed OBA that we have been working on.  Please review and let me know if you have any concerns.   

Thanks, Kim.

 

Earl,

Thanks for the note.  Mansoor and I have talked and we would definitely like you to put a hold on this meter.  I will keep you posted on Questar's response to the list of equipment that you provided us last week as to how quickly they could receive any of this equipemnt.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim
If don't foresee a problem with the agreement let's tell Earl to go head. This will expedite the in -service date.

Lindy, 

Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is a draft presentation for credit agencies regarding TW.  Please take a look at it and provide me with your comments.  In particular, I have designated some pages that I think you can help me with, see below.  Please feel free to comment on the rest of the presentation too.

Thanks,

Gary,

Henry did fax me some of the literature, but the quality of the fax is such that it is hard to read.  I am meeting with Jack tomorrow at 10:30, how about I stop by and see you.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Henry said he provided you with the requested information.  I wanted to follow-up and see if you had any questions or if we can be of further service.  I will be happy to expedite a Visa Platinum card for you.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Gary

Henry,

While I am out, would you please do a comparison for Kim.  She is one of our directors.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Gary

Gary,

We just received this information regarding our new corporate expense card.  I'm not sure I see any benefits by getting one of the new Wright Travel Cards vs. using the EFCU.  Would you please look this over and let me know your thoughts.  If I choose to stay with the EFCU, I would probably like to get  a different card from the current EFCU Master Card so that I can keep my business and personal charges separate.  

Can you provide me your thoughts?

Thanks, Kim.

TW Commercial Team, please complete the attached application as soon as possible and forward to me.  I will compile all applications and submit to Kim for approval.

Kim, I will forward your application to Steve for approval.

Thanks guys.

(713) 646-2551 Fax

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.   Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant. 

Implementation
Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.

The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if:
*	Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date.
*	A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.

Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under "Company Information" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.
	
All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.

Procedure
The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.

Card Activation:
Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Rewards Program
Wright Express travel card holders may participate in a rewards program, which is outlined in an attached document.  All fees charged by Wright Express for the rewards program is the employee's personal responsibility. 

Please address all questions concerning the travel and entertainment program to Bruce Martin 713-345-1833, Cheri Sublet 713-345-3475, Mary Ann Johnson 713-345-3479 or Morris Brassfield 713-646-7006.

Jerry-

Just a follow up.

I have not rec'd the license we discussed last week and am concerned as we have been doing some email changes and I wanted to make sure I care for this prior to some travel later this week.

many Thanks

Paula 

Lorraine and Paul,

Please coordinate with each other and provide Steve an update by noon tomorrow (Wednesday) as to where your conversations stand with your customers on flipping these deals from Index to fixed rates.  He has a meeting with Stan at 2:00pm and will be asked about these I'm sure.  

Also, Paul, would you please provide Steve any additional thoughts ( like we discussed yesterday) with respect to how and what things are included in our VaR.  

Many thanks, Kim. 

fyi
NNG marketing should not be doing this anymore should they?  Can I get a copy of the two calculations and have someone walk me through them today.  Can we not get resolution on the problem we seem to have here?    Steve Harris will be in this meeting as well to discuss how TW is going to handle the I to I deals going forward.  

	As a note for the  "cc" list above: the TW VaR has decreased (From over $1million to $600,000) for unexplained 
	reasons and is believed to be related to the volatility calculation which is done by NNG Marketing using SAS
	(Statistical Analysis Software) as input into Caminus.  We have talked to Richard Riehm in Marketing and he
	is looking into the problem but is not sure what's causing these unusual swings.  The Daily Risk report has not been 	distributed for the last few days pending resolution of this calculation problem but the correct VaR is still believed
	to be over the ETS VaR limit.

	We are scheduled to meet with Stan tomorrow, at his request of Vince, to discuss the TW VaR.  I know Tracy
	and Vince has had some discussions related to the VaR calculation and that Tracy has discussed TW Marketing's
	plans to reduce the VaR.  I'm assuming Tracy will "facilitate" the meeting tomorrow and I suggest we use the last 
	VaR calculation 	we believe to be correct for discussion purposes which was as of February 4 data (Total VaR - $1.152mm).

I think that the problem with the TW VaR is how the volatility is being calculated on the San Juan indices for the months of November 2002 through March 2003.  This is not a Caminus issue, but an issue of how the volatility is being calculated outside Caminus.  It sounded as though Jose will not work on any issue related to Caminus, but I think this issue is outside of Caminus

Comments?

FYI, Kim.

Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.

Jan, I believe that I do not have any memberships that fall into this category.  I'm thinking that Steve is the only one with possible memberships here.

Thanks, Kim.

I would like to ask for your help in providing me with the following details for each membership you may have.

1)	Corporate Membership or Individual Membership
2)	Reimbursement of Initiation Fees
3)	Timing of reimbursement of initiation fees
4)	Type of membership reimbursement method (one of the three listed below)
5)	Is there a business reason to continue payment of fees?

	Reimbursement methods:
1)   Flex Perks
2)   Payroll Reimbursement
      3)	Reimbursement via direct payment to employee or to the country club

Should you not have any memberships, please respond to that effect.  I need this information by Tuesday, February 26.

Thank you for your assistance.

Jan

I like it.  Kim.

We have encountered a conflict with our proposed tagline: Beyond Banking.  There is bank in Georgia who has that slogan federally trademarked.  We have slightly revised our tagline to: Going Beyond Banking.  We believe this actually strengthens the tagline and makes it more active.  

Please let me know as soon as possible if you strongly object to using this new tagline, otherwise we will proceed with production.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Elizabeth,
 
Please read below.   Can you help us put together a summary of the TW Capacity Releases from Nov. 00 to Aug. 01?  We are in the process of putting our strategy together on our Neg. Rate hearing.  Is it possible to assemble this soon?  Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.  
 
Many thanks,
Kim.
Once she has these dates,  I'd like to see from 11/00 to 2/01 which may show a change in value also.  MK

Yes, I think it would be helpful if Elizabeth can provide detail on capacity releases from Feb 2001- to July or August 2001.  Thanks, Maria

Greg and Maria,
 
FYI.  Here is a report for the July Capacity Releases on TW.  PG&E, Sempra and Texaco all released on an Index to Index spread and are above max rate.  Elizabeth has the history of TW Capacity Releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates.  
 
Thanks, Kim.
 
 
Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.  

Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):

PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00 
Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50 
Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00

These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

 

 

 

Alma,

I would like to attend the March 21 at 1:30 demo.  Where?

Thanks, Kim.

The new TW Contract/Capacity Release system is due to be implemented the weekend of March 9, 2002.  We will be offering training/demo's of the new system for internal users on the below dates.  Please contact Alma Carrillo with the date and time you would like to attend.  

Thanks

Linda

Monday March 18th:  Two Sessions - 1:30pm and 3:00pm

Thursday March 21st:  One Session - 1:30pm

If you have any questions or will be unable to attend one of the above demo sessions please let me know.

Elizabeth, Yes I would like to discuss this with you.  My schedule for Wednesday afternoon or Thursday looks good.  How about you?

Kim.

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792

Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Hi Robert,
 
Yes, I am still here!  However, the Research and Development department is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted. 
 
Kim.

Hi Kim,

Just a note to see if you are still there at Enron.

I have gotten many e-mails back, mostly the tech guys, including Vince.

But I don't remember having got e-mails back from you, so maybe you are still there.

If so, I certainly wish you the best in whatever direction you ultimately take.

Obviously, Transwestern is an important pipeline and will continue to operate.

If we can be of help at any time in the future after the dust finally settles, please let me know.

Stay in touch!

Thanks,

Bob Brooks

Hi Jo,
 
Yes, I do have time on Wednesday afternoon and would like to meet with you.  Might you be available anytime after 2:00pm?  
 
Thanks, Kim.

Please see attached proposal per our discussion regarding transportation on NNG.  Please call to discuss when you have a few minutes.  I intend to be in Houston next Wednesday, if you would like to discuss in person.  Let me know if you have a few minutes and I will try and meet up with you.

Great, I'll see you at 2:00.  I am coming back in town on Wed, so if I can get back to the office by 1:30, do you want me to call you to come over early?
 
Thanks, Kim.

Yes, I am available after 2:00.  I think our plane leaves around 4:00 or after, so right at 2:00 p.m. would probably be best.  Can you do that?  IF so, I will walk over to the enron building and meet you in the lobby at 2:00 p.m.

I didn't know you were going to Florida in July.  I will look at my schedule.  Do we know anyone in Miami?  ILY, K.

Hey, did we decide whether you were going to Florida with me in July?  The
meeting starts for me on Sunday, 7/14 and runs through Wednesday morning the
17th.

If you're interested, we could fly up on Thursday or Friday before and you
could fly out on Sunday the 14th.

This is apparently very close to Miami, so there may be someone we know that
we could visit.  I'm sending you a map via your hotmail account.

See if your job situation will permit you to go with me!

Please see attached proposal per our discussion regarding transportation on NNG.  Please call to discuss when you have a few minutes.  I intend to be in Houston next Wednesday, if you would like to discuss in person.  Let me know if you have a few minutes and I will try and meet up with you.

TK,
 
Here is the proposal from NNG on south end transportation.  Any thoughts....particularity on the one year proposal of $0.065 plus commodity and fuel?   What do you think capacity release would cost for a one year term?
 
Thanks, Kim.

FYI, Kim.
I think you are right on.  Thanks, Maria

Yes, it does mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we can contract for on PNM--however, we have to use the capacity in accordance with our tariff and rates meaning if the PNM capacity is subject to recall (which I thought was the Commission's concern in the PNM order last year) then we can't use that capacity to sell firm service (not subject to recall) on our system.  I don't think we are relieved of our reporting requirements either that were required in the PNM order.  Maria--please comment if you think I have interpreted this incorrectly.
Ranelle

Ranelle,

Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?

I'm very glad that this passed.  Thank you for your help!  Kim.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792

Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

I have a conference call then.  How about Friday morning or afternoon?

Can we move it back to 3pm...someone just scheduled another meeting for our upcoming implementation.

How about today (Thursday) at 2:00.  Can you come to EB1336?.  John, are you available, also?

Thanks, Kim.

Sorry for the delay in response...I'm up to my ears in preparation for TW's new contracts/capacity release implementation.  I am available both Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.  Please let me know which is better for you.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Steve,

What was the Oneok issue?  What does Ann mean by "ETS was releasing gas to Oneok"?  

fyi. I am following -up on this.

Can you follow up on this.

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.  

I must be sleepy this morning.  ??.   K.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================

PREVIEW for March 3, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks -

   I hope you have been allowing the story of One/Two Man to work its magic
on you. It is a most wonderful story.

   But what in the world - either the outer or inner world - does such a
story have to do with us? And those various animals who helped One/Two Man
in his task? Especially the snake?

   When we gather this week, as promised, I'll give you some ideas about
what this story means. What I'm mostly interested in is how we can use this
story and others like it - and there are many - for our own movement toward
freedom and love.

   I also want to connect this story to that primal Judeo-Christian story of
the exodus.

   I hope to see you this week as we continue our journey
   from bondage to freedom,
      from darkness to light,
         from death to life.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

========================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an

Theresa,

I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?  

Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Have you thought about buying a call on the spread instead of unwinding the spread outright?  (Just a thought)

Thanks,
Theresa

See the attached spreadsheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

FYI, Kim.

In the CPUC's meeting today, the Commission approved the proposed RLS/Peaking tariff which provides for a bypass peaking rate when customers bypass their system except for peaking service.  It appears they approved the June 19th Proposed Decision which establishes a cost based rate made up of four components--Customer Charge, Public Purpose Program charge, Reservation Charge and a volumetric Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge.  As soon as the Order is published I'll review the final Order and advise if this is still true or if any changes were made.  SoCal will have 10 days from the Order to file an Advice Letter with conforming tariff sheets.

Audrey,  Here they are.

Thanks, Kim.

 

John,

Look at this.  Kim.

-Look real closely!

Can you spot what's wrong with this picture? Look closely. It may take you a minute.
http://secure.falcon-networks.com/~culprit/whatswrong.html

Lindy, this looks good.  I like it.

Thanks, Kim.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

TK,

This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time!  You should have heard me scream!  I laughed so hard I had to hang up on the Steve Cooper voice mail.

Mansoor,  this is the other thing I was trying to remember when I was in your office this afternoon.  I would like to discuss this with you.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, regarding the question below pertaining to the abandonment of units at Ivanhoe, what do we need to do next?  We are currently out of compliance on the ESD system and would like to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Thanks for the feedback. Kim Watson is the appropriate person to talk to on this. 
Steve

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.
Randy

Thanks, this was exactly what I was looking for.  

Kim.

Kim,

Per Jan Moore's phone conversation this morning requesting the TW Capital IT project expenses for 2000 to Current:

The RMS work orders show a total of $105,622 actually billed to TW. The budgeted amount was $690,510. The work orders never were allocated with the actual costs, so majority of the actual costs are still showing up on NNG's books.

The Market Intelligence work order shows a total of $36,949 actually billed to TW. Let me know if we need to discuss this further.

Thanks,

Mark Ferguson

Yes, however, I thought I saw an earlier message from you booking this meeting at 9:00.  Either time works for me.  Please confirm. 

Thanks, Kim.

Audrey, 
Could you please check Steve's and Kim's calendars to see if I can visit with them for about 30 mins
on Wed - Fri this week or some time next week. It will essentially be a Feedback/Update meeting on Facility planning and optimization support to marketing.
Thank you
Ben

FYI, Kim.

FYI,
	Looks like we have a few adm things to get in place before we can implement.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >>

John, sorry, I forgot to respond, they look fine.  Thanks, Kim.

Please review and make any suggestion ASAP to the attached TW customer notification letters that will be used in the implementation of the Contract and Capacity Release application.

Randy,

Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning.  We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station.  Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them.  We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings.  

How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?

Thanks, Kim.

Randy

Lindy, can you respond to this?  

Many thanks, Kim.

Is the message that is sent via EDI the same as the message that is displayed on our Web site?  If not, can you explain why there would be a difference?

Everyone,

As stated below in Rich's memo, the quantities that will be posted in the new daily unsubscribed report are the same quantities that TW is currently sending in EDI files. As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.

I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.

 TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:

	Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.  Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000.

For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:

	The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.  Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity.

Please review and let me know if any revisions need to be made to the above text messages.

Thanks,
Mary 
	 -----Original Message-----
	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

	Glen Hass
	Toby Kuehl
	Brad Holmes
	TK Lokman

Steve,

Are you available on Wednesday to discuss the Ivanhoe station?  We want to describe to you what the situation is and get your advice on what our regulatory options are.  I'm available anytime except 9:00-10:00 and 2:00-3:00.

did you get an updated tariff from Reg Affairs?  Let me know if you still need assistance.

Thanks, Kim. 

Kim, Eric is borrowing Kevin Hyatt's TW Tariffs (small) binder.  He has asked me to try to get one for him.  Does someone supply those or do I just need to have it reproduced for him. 

Thanks!

Audrey,  

My changes are in color.  Also, I will bring over to you a list of others to add.  (I could not add rows to this spreadsheet, sorry).

Thanks, Kim.

I would like to see if you guys can take a few minutes to update our Customer List for Steve.

Hi Kirk,

I just wanted to check in with you and see how you were doing.  How is the Big Sandy Project?  How are you doing on the water rights?  I hope all is well.  We're doing fine in Transwestern.  

Kim.

It's official!  We are moving next week on Thursday, March, 14!  Actually, we have to be packed up by close of business on Wednesday, March 13.  Ruthann will be calling each of you to discuss your move needs, such as your type of computer equipment, whether or not you are moving your chair, etc...Boxes will be coming soon.

Please let Audrey or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim.

How about I talk with her on the phone...  We can visit with her tonight.  K.

Kim -

I made a few notes below...any enhancements?

JW

John,
I need your advice.  My sister and I have decided to take a trip together
this fall.  We are interested in about a 6-7 day trip (does not include
travel days), splitting it between London and Paris.

We thought we'd fly to London and spend a few days, then take the tunnel
bullet train to Paris and spend a few day and return to London to fly home.

Our questions are:

1.  When is a better time to visit Paris, September or October - we want to
avoid high tourist season and maybe capitalize on lower hotel prices.

2.  My sister has visited London many times and has friends there, so we
won't have any trouble with an agenda, however, we've never been to Paris.

3.  For 2-3 days what would you recommend we do/see in Paris?
Highlights: the Louvre, the Orsay, Saint Chapelle (behind Notre Dame), the
sewer tour (I'm not kidding), shopping at Galleries Lafayette and Printemps,
the Eiffel Tower, other stuff?

4.  What reasonably priced hotels would you recommend in Paris?
Kim found one in the more residential area that is near ??

5.  Any other advice/tips?
Try to eat at Cafe/Bistro Bacchanal (something like that).  We ate there on
one trip and couldn't get in the next time.
Buy your Metro tickets by the carnet (10 at a time).

Thank you so much,
Jane

Gaylen and Jodi,

Here is the schematic for the Blanco Hub, it has not been updated for your new interconnect yet.  

Gaylen, I got your voice mail on amending the payment schedule if you guys are purchasing most of the equipment and I am OK with amending it to reflect the change in spending.  I've got a draft that I will update for the spending.  I'll send it to you soon.  

By the way, do you guys have a list of the customers that will be attending your customer meeting next week?  I am scheduled for the second session.

Thanks, Kim.

 

We have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.  The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.

I have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.  

I have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.  I'll keep you posted. 

I thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.  If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?  I have not checked into other Rome hotels.  Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

Oh, My Italian Amigos,

I just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.

http://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html

http://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm

Please check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.  

John, do you have a preference?  Paul please talk with Judy and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  Paul, you'll have to give me your credit card information.  Call me with this info, do not send email.  (Due to Big E issues, I cannot delete any email messages and I don't want this info hanging around.)

Steve, 

We are still confirming whether or not TW has had other I to I deals negotiated in the past.  So far, TK, Lorraine and Michelle don't think that we have any, but I will talk to Lindy tomorrow.  Here are some NNG I to I neg. rates that have been approved during the past year.  

I will keep you posted. 

Kim.

Kim - in the past year, Ranelle & I found 4 Negotiated Rate deals involving index differentials in the past year.
All were approved.  I cut & pasted relevant sections for NNG tariff sheets (the complete sheets are in the Current & Superseded sections under NNG's Informational Postings-Tariff on the EBB)

I don't have the docket number for the first one with Midamerican Energy, 1/2000.
The others are:
RP96-272-016 8/1/2001 Dynegy marketing
RP96-272-024 1/1/2001 Oneok & Aquila
  (Tariff sheet dated 1/16/2001 - there was apparently some other change after the initial filing)
RP96-272-029 4/1/2001 MIdAmerican Energy

Stuart,

Your ears, or maybe mine, must have been burning lately.  I have been thinking about you over the past couple of days and wanted to call you and schedule lunch.  Is your new office in the Greenway Plaza area?  Gosh, we have lots to catch up on from both your side and mine.

Congratulations!  I know you must be excited and I can't wait to hear about your new opportunities with WHES!

What is you schedule the week of March 18?  Are you available for lunch anytime the week of 3/18?

Thanks, 

Kim.  

Katy,

Thanks for the list, however, I do not have word perferct and cannot open the document.  Can you convert it to a Word document and re-send?

Sorry for the trouble.

Thanks,

Kim.  :>)

Kim--
Attached is a list of our customers who are attending the customer meeting for the second session.

Ben and Dennis,

We do indeed appreciate being able to use the 3907 conference room for our morning meetings.  Thank you for moving your standing Wednesday staff meetings to another meeting room.  We look forward to being on the same floor with everyone!

See you Thursday on EB39!

Kim.  :>)

Alicia, thanks for your patience as we attempt to acquire meeting space for our team.   Initially,  the TW Commercial Team wanted to hold its morning meetings in ECN-39C1, however, our team has decided to keep the space reserved in ECN 3907 for our morning meetings from 8:00 - 8:30a and Friday afternoon meetings from 3:00 - 3:30p.

Marian Salinas, who keeps the schedule for the team rooms on the 39th floor,  noted there was a conflict only on Wednesday mornings.  Ben Asante and Leigh Ann Foret have graciously agreed to release this Wednesday morning slot for our team.  The Facility Planning/Optimization team will now meet in ECN 3998 for there weekly meetings held on Wednesdays from 8:00 - 9:00a.  

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your assistance in making things happen for the TW Commercial Team.  We look forward to our upcoming move to the 39th floor on next week.

Thanks again for your assistance,

My Italian Amigos,

I have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  

Is this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?

Also, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.

Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!

Please send me your bullets ASAP this morning.  If you have no bullets to report, please reply to me that you have none.  

Thanks, Kim.

Audrey, here they are!

 

Steve, 

I just ran into Tracy in the hall and she asked if on Trans Pecos the $131MM (or it could be $138MM) represented 100% or 50% of the cost.  The $131 is 100% of the cost of the project.  If we joint venture with KMI, our cost would be half of this.  Call me if you have questions.

Thanks, Kim.

I will be out of town next Friday.  Lorraine will be attending for our group.  Thank you for the invite.  Kim.

Ruth, would you please invite Lindy Donoho also.  Thanks, Kim.

yes.

By the way, I don't think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today.  Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July.  Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.  TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.  The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.

Thanks, Kim.  

Did I read this right in that we only made $1000 for July but last month we made$1,000,000?  

Attached is the detail of July 2001 PNR charges. 

 <<July01pnr.xls>>  

Yes, I called Steve Harris from the airport.  What is the amount?  I was not sure from the numbers below.  Please save the detail from my expense account. 

Thanks, Kim.

Lindy,

We are meeting on Tues at 10:00 in 1336 to discuss how TW may handle a storage point on our system with respect to how we contract for this point (given that contracts will want to receive and deliver to this point on a firm basis) as well as how we schedule gas at this point.  Will you be able to attend and give us your advise?

Many thanks, Kim.

We are sending them over this morning.  I have already talked to Dave Matney and told him the agreements were coming this morning.  They will review and we will plan to meet next Mon or Tues to iron out any remaining items (such as the operatorship) so we can tender to Pemex.  

Stan is OK with them and has agreed that if we need to conceded the operatorship, we can, but he would like an opener in three years to re-bid the operatorship.  

Did we send the new version to K/M yet.

Steve, FYI, Kim.

I spoke with San Juan early this morning and they indicated they would be running another pig this Wednesday.  
  
I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

We kicked a pig down the San Juan Lat. on 2-27-02 @ 08:03 MST Pressure was 1145 PSI, Flow of 840.  It was a newly rebuild pig and was kicked dry.   Bisti was down for 55 min, and the pig went by Bisti @ 10:26 MST.  Data at each valve site retreved off RTUs.   If you have any questions or comments, please call.

Earl and Mansoor,

I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.  Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed. 

Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.  Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?  Does anyone else need to see it?  Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

Dennis,  I am travelling Wednesday and will not be able to attend.  I am asking Lorraine to attend in my place. 

Thanks, Kim.

Lorraine,  Will you be able to attend this meeting?  Thanks, Kim.

Please plan to attend a short meeting Wednesday, March 13 at 10:30 in ECN 3907 to discuss TW Firm shippers' amendments, transactional reporting, and "Holding Capacity".

The session should not last more than 1 hour.

Thank you.

Mark, let's discuss this and get with Kevin.  Thanks, Kim.

Kim:
In the past, we have looked at this as a joint venture - my understanding is that this has been changed to an undivided ownership at the TW level.  From a deal structuring perspective, this is a major change. I just need to re-think this one a bit.  
Kevin

pretty cute.

To all my Aggie friends and other friends who will be amused ....

Earl,

Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?  Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?  FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week.  If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files.  

Let me know if I need to talk to Agave.  

Thanks, Kim.

Received an as-built package for the interconnect on West Texas Lateral. Material matches up but there is not a hydro test and test log for the installation. This is needed to set MAOP and PHD of the facility.

Lou--while you were on the lake...

Thanks, Kim.

After having several conversations, I found out that TW's daily unsubscribed capacity will not actually match the monthly unsubscribed capacity.  The lowest of the numbers from the posting date to the end of the month will show up as the monthly number (i.e.  If the available capacity is 0 on the last day of the month, "0" will show up as the monthly number for the whole month).  I also found out that for on-line reporting, we can display the actual daily number from TW's CAS system.  EDI will continue to send out the monthly numbers which match the on-line monthly report.  EDI will continue this process until further analysis can be done.

Patty Hermanek will modify the daily report in Model Office and notify everyone when she is done.

	 -----Original Message-----
	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

Hattie, 
 
Yes, I will fax it to you when I get home tonight.  In fact, when you get it, why don't you call me and we can talk about it.  This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school.  They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.  I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.  
 
My home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.
 
Thanks, Kim.   :>)

Kim:
       Would you please fax the Red Pepper Soup recipe to me at (281) 334-2466?  The (409) fax number is Jim's office -- and he is in New Orleans all week.  
       Thank you, Kim.

TK,

When you get back from vacation, let's talk about this.  What do I need to do?

Thanks, Kim.

Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

I received a message that there will be a surprise lunch for Rich Jolly on Friday, March 29 from 11:30 to 1:00pm in ECN46C1.  Rich is retiring after 35 years of service.  Everyone is invited.

Thanks, Kim.

Tiny, 

I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.

Good luck on Bisti!

Thanks, Kim.

Tiny,

Thanks for the note.  I'll let TK and Mark know that you got the money for the four wheeler.  Along with many, we will miss Rich a lot.  

Thanks, Kim.

Good to hear from you Kim.  First, I did get the check.. I've been out of the office for over two weeks so it will be cashed this week sometime. Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  

We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.  

Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....  My wife is making a card and we will have your names included...

FYI, Kim.

  

It may be a good idea for everyone to attend this meeting to get brought up to speed on the 637 filing.

See you there.

Kim.

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

Martha,
 
I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.  Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).  Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.  He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.
 
His office number is 713 739-6715  (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).  His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).
 
Please give him a call.  He is very happy in his new role.  My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him.  
 
Give me a shout when you get back into the office.  
 
 
Thanks, Kim
 
 
P.S.  We moved up to 39 last weekend.  I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.  Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.  (Sorry.......)  Call me.

Kim - I cannot make lunch today with you and Frank.   My husband scheduled a meeting with our financial guy over the noon hour, unaware that I had this planned.    I am OK for you two to go to lunch but I would like to call Frank.  Do you have his number?  Where does he work now?
 
My apologies for the late notice .....  your friend, Martha

L---
Can you help with this?  Per my conversation with you earlier today.  

Thanks, Kim.

In preparation of the new reporting requirements mandated by FERC, there are a couple of items under Question 1 that we need to decide on regarding the method of data retrieval.  These are:

	b.  the terms and effective date of the contract
	h.  the rate charged in $$/MMbtu

Rick - Currently, the effective or execution date is not captured anywhere.  I will need someone (on of the Alma's or Josh) to extract all TW contracts and populate this info onto a spreadsheed.  Prospectively, this info will also need to be captured with each new contract.  

Kim - With regard to the rate charged, I am concerned with how the information will be captured and stored.  It's virtually impossible to use the current CBS rate system because at the end of the month, there is a great possibility that these FT rates to the Cal border will be buried into a calculated, blended rate (due to capturing incremental fees for alternate point usage).  Also as I mentioned in a previous e-mail to TK, we need to ensure that the IT rates are updated in the rate system promptly.

Don - After your initial review of the data request, did you have any other concerns regarding data retrieval and automation of the process?  I will need to do some investigation regarding what it might take to add some additional fields/identifiers.

Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Per the Commission's order yesterday, Transwestern will be required to submit daily transportation activity (nominated, scheduled & delivered), capacity release activity and capacity beginning August 1, 2001.  The information will be submitted 30 days after the close of a month -- meaning that our first report will be due September 30.  The order does not specify when the historical capacity information for May 1999 and May 2000 needs to be submitted -- so at this point I'm assuming that it will submitted with the first report.

I would like to have a brief get-together tomorrow at 10:30 AM (Ricki will follow with details) just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant.  In particular, now that we will have to report nominated vs. scheduled to the Cal. border each day -- I have an even heightened concern that we head into the month making sure that we capture the SoCal Window number each day.

Attached is the Commission's "Order Imposing Reporting Requirement on Natural Gas Sales to California Market," which was issued late yesterday.

In the order, the Commission finds that if does have the authority to request the information as set out in the May 18 order proposing the requirements.   

	The information is to cover August 1, 2001 through Sept. 30, 2002 (the end date coincides with the end of the Commission's mitigation plan re: wholesal prices in California and the West).
	Specific info gas sellers and LDCs file concernign purchase and sales transactions is exempt from FOIA disclosure
	Also, respondents may request privileged treatment of "other portions of their responses subject to the.....Commission's regulations"
	Some of the questions have been modified based on comments received based on comments received on the May 18th proposal
	Transaction by transaction data is required; FERC will aggregate the information
	The information request will NOT be expanded beyond California
	FERC is providing the reporting format as a data template to be available on RIMS.

The order is attached here, and the appendix listing specific questions is below.      <<RM01-9.00A.doc>>

Dear Gary and Fran,

Attached, please find a resignation letter from both me and Lorraine Lindberg.  If you would like a signed hard copy, just let me know, I would be happy to provide it to you.  Lorraine has also indicated that she would provide you a signed hard copy, too.   

At your convience, I would like to visit with each of you.  

Sincerely, 

Kim.

     

Steve, Tiny sent me this note when he heard the news.

K.

Dang...  What do I say?  I heard the news last night.  I hate it, but I gotta say I'm excited for all of you!  

When I think of some of the folks who exemplify what Transwestern Pipeline is..... who's character Transwestern Pipeline was built on..... I just have a hard time  imagining Transwestern Pipeline without Kim Watson and Steve Harris.  

I am also so envious of you all.... (I'm turning green..Ha!)  I had serious hopes that KMI (Mrs. McDonald) would make a serious run at TW, but now, well we shall have to see.  If you all ever need a hard working, simple minded, trouble making, but dedicated field ops manager .... give me a call.   

I'm going to miss your enthusiasm.  

"Love the Work You are With"

Hattie,
 
This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
 
Good Luck!
 
Kim.

Kim:
       Yes, I received the recipe for red soup.  It looks like one of your's, from your personal collection.  Looks delicious.  I think I'll prepare it early and serve it chilled.  What do you think?  Thanks for faxing it. 
       Jim has been at a trade show in New Orleans all week, and he's coming home tonight.  Yea!!!!
       We'll see you Saturday night.  
Regards,  

Hattie Thurlow-McKinley 

Sherry,

More unsubscribed capacity reporting....

Thanks, Kim.

Below is a link to the first version of the TW Daily Unsubscribed Capacity Report. 

http://hottapmo.ets.enron.com/Infopostings/tw/asp/et_unsub_capacity.asp

Please review the report for the basic format only.  Please keep in mind that the data is from model office, not production; and that the final format of the report will have filtering, sorting and downloading options.

If you have questions, please let me know (x39516).  

Thanks.

	 -----Original Message-----
	In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

	This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

FYI, Kim.

Kim, could you let me know who the team can talk to about their concern over TW pipe ownership?

Randy - Tony has some concerns about the possible ownership of some of the abandoned pipe from the TW system.  We had assumed that all of the pipe was either sold or abandoned.  Tony said that Lonnie seemed to have some information about what may still be under ETS' ownership?  We would like to identify exactly what we need to be responsible for so that it can be adequately protected against possible encroachment problems.

Thanks! - Weldon

Here is an estimate for the upgrade to the Ivanhoe ESD system.   Please keep in mind that the HP at the location has not been in operation for several years and If it is ever required, we may be looking a major expense for that, too.  ($200,000+or-)

<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>

FYI, Kim.

Thanks for the info.  
Fred, do you know how much it will take to upgrade the ESD system?

Randy,

Mansoor and I met on this topic this morning.  We are confirming with Perry Frazier what, if any, firm commitments we may have on this system to make sure we understand possible impacts of abandoning this station.  Also, we will meet with the regulatory folks this week to discuss the various regulatory options with them.  We will keep you updated as we progress through these meetings.  

How much money is required on the Ivanhoe station to keep ESD compliant?

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, regarding the question below pertaining to the abandonment of units at Ivanhoe, what do we need to do next?  We are currently out of compliance on the ESD system and would like to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.

Thanks for the feedback. Kim Watson is the appropriate person to talk to on this. 
Steve

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.

Kim,  we have some units at Ivanhoe Station that have not operated in quite a long time.  We need to begin a process to abandon the units otherwise we are looking at a rather large expense to upgrade the station esd system.  Can you let us know how we can begin to move toward this end?
Fred Jordan or the Beaver Pipeline Team can provide more information about the specifics. 
Thanks for your help.

FYI, Kim.

Do either of you know?

Do we have a projected timeline of expenditures?

Stan/ Rod, here is the most recent red-lined version of the TransPecos agreement. We have substanially changed numerous items from the prior
red-line and feel this more accurately represents TW's interests. Please review the  document and let me know if you are comfortable with it. In particular, we have softened the language requiring us to demonstrate our financial ability to provide services under the agreement. 

At this point, we are just trying to agree on the basics of the K/M LOI so that we can get the transport rate proposal in front of Pemex.

Mansoor:

In response to your request about any Firm contracts on the 8" line between Atoka # 3 & #1.  There are 3 contracts using the 12" and 8" common lines, one is a Socal contract # 8255 at Rio Pecos for 6000 mmcf and an Agave contract # 26490 for 800 mmcf.  The third is an Agave contract # 27377 for March 2002 only.  I would suggest changing the contract primary points to something other than Rio Pecos.  The Socal volumes have been delivered, for sometime,  at the Discharge of Atoka #1.  The Aid State POI has been where this Socal gas has flowed.

FYI, Kim.

Just a couple of additional thoughts,  the cost estimate for ESD mods of $130,000 will typically be, about 25% more.  The E&C costs,  company overheads and construction support will increase these costs to around $170,000.  I did talk with Fred this morning and will relay the highlights of our conversation.  

The current free flow rates north on this lateral average around 35 - 50 mmcfd.  The gas supply is from the Leedy Plant and various low pressure gathering interconnects.  The gas flows north bypassing the compression unit but utilizing the dehydration unit at Ivanhoe.  The gas end up with NNG on the North side of the lateral,  this Lipscomb lateral is isolated from the TW system at the Canadian River block valve.  The 2 units at Ivanhoe are idle and were designed for higher pressure delivery to NNG.  Since they have not run in some time, its probable to spend an additional $300,000 to activate and upgrade the control panels and end devices.  Then we would most likely have to design and resize the units for an additional guess of $350,000.

In order to abandon these units, I would recommend we abandon in place or Plant Held For Future Use.  My guess is about $15 - 25,000 to pull spool pieces and blind flange the units.  I do know that there is some drilling going on in the area,  I don't see a tremendous influx of supply to support the cost to utilize this lateral any different than the current status.

Let us know your comments.

Mark,

After Earl met with Questar on last Wednesday Feb-20 my understanding is that:

1): TW will build all the necessary interconnect facilities and that Questar is responsible for total costs.

2):	In-service date is May-1 and that could be sooner if Questar will support us in purchasing materials

3): You have revised the agreement and it is based on the above term/ conditions

4): Earl has revised the Work.Order for routing and it is based on the above.

Am I correct on 1,2,3 and 4 ?

Thanks, Mansoor

FYI, Kim.

Earl

Please proceed to issue a  Work Order to construct the facility requirements ( tap, valve, measurement and  DAS facilities as previously described) to tie Questar to TW at San Juan. Please see attachment where Questar explains that you have to acquire a small R.O.W from Elpaso and that will connect TW property to the site where eventually will be Questar's R.O.W.
TW will be reimbursed by Quesatr for the total costs at no tax-gross up is added for this particular project. TW will own and operate the interconnect facilities. 

Payment Schedule

Payment No.				Amount			Due Date

Payment #1				$137,562		         Within 10 days after full 
	   execution of the Agreement.

Payment #2				$137,562			Within four (4) weeks after
full execution of the Agreement.

Payment #3				$137,562			Within eight (8) weeks after
									Full execution of the 
									Agreement.

Payment #4				$137,560			Within 30 days after 
					Or balance of actual		Transwestern submits to 
					costs if over the original	Southern Trails a final 
					estimate shown, 		Invoice for actual costs, 
					according to Sec. 3.2 of	Subject to Sec. 3.2 of the 
					the Agreement.		Agreement.

	Total				$550,246 or actual

The in-service date that Marketing is recommending is May-1 and I know that you might have a problem with that but according to Kim Watson Questar is willing  to support us in purchasing materials a little quicker than us. 

Your engineering contact with Questar is Jerry Mouser at 801-324-5744.

Call me if you any concerns/ questions on this project.

Mansoor, 

Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar.  We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1.  The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week.  I will let you know when it is officially signed.  If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like .  Please let me know if you need additional information.
Thanks, Kim.
Kim,
As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
Thank you for all your help.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

It would cost approximately $515,000 to build all the necessary interconnect facilities to deliver gas to Questar at this location( please see attached "B" release from Engineering-Roswell). Since TW is constructing this project for Questar we need to add 31.16 % tax gross-up and that will make a total  cost of $ 675,427 for the project.

Again your previous cost of $702,000 , mentioned in the agreement with Questar, is fine because even "B" release cost estimates are approximately 15% ?.

If you any questions please call me at anytime.

The line north of the Blanco Hub Questar is tieing into is 30".  The line number is NMBM154A1 with an MAOP of 1009 psig.  There is 1368' of pipe.  Only thing we don't know is exactly wher on the line Questar will tie into.  Other issue came up was the installation of a blowoff near the valve on the north end.  Currently can't blow the line down properly on that end.  North end of the line is up a hill and the team is afraid they can't get the gas out blowing down hill.  Kim is aware about the blowoff and the team will look into the cost.  They claim the team can't install with help from the region welders at a cheap costs.  Hope this is enough info.

Earl,

Will you be able to coordinate with Agave to do this?  [Chanley, Earl]  Will call Agave and make request  Have you talked to Paul Ragsdale yet?  [Chanley, Earl]  No  FYI, I had Audrey send my copy of the as-built drawing to you last week.  If this is a duplicate from what Agave sent you, would you please forward the copy I sent you to Mansoor for his files.   [Chanley, Earl]  Have not received your copy to date, will send to Mansoor when received.  

Let me know if I need to talk to Agave.  

Thanks, Kim.

I have been contacted by Questar this morning and they brought up several options, They build, own and operate, and I indicated there wasn't a problem from E&C if this was the deal Marketing set up. He is to send preliminary designs for E&C to review and materials they use. 
Will keep you informed as project progresses. 

Thanks

Earl,

Thanks for the note.  Mansoor and I have talked and we would definitely like you to put a hold on this meter.  I will keep you posted on Questar's response to the list of equipment that you provided us last week as to how quickly they could receive any of this equipemnt.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim
If don't foresee a problem with the agreement let's tell Earl to go head. This will expedite the in -service date.
Mansoor

Mansoor,

I did receive the signed I/C Agreement from Questar late on Friday.  I am currently routing it for approval for TW's signature.  If putting a hold on this meter would help improve the in-service date, I would definitely recommend it.  Would you please provide me your thoughts.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim

Instromat will have a 10" ultra sonic meter and calibrations ready by the end of March. I have not seen the approved PA. If this is a go, I can put a hold on this meter for Delivery to the Questar facility. Please let me know if Marketing would like to proceed on this. 

Thanks

In a effort to expedite the materials for Questar I/C, can Questar look at what their time frame for getting the following material is to see if it would assist in getting the interconnect in service sooner.
If they have any questions on material, have them call me. 

1) 10" UltraSonic meter with Gallagher flow conditioner, tubes and calibrated. flow one direction.
2) Denials single stream chromatograph, Model 2350, with test gas, Heater box for test gas, and controls.
3) Bristol 3330 EFM with panel box std. 
4) MECO H20 Monitor
5) Building with heat/ac, general gas monitor, breaker with shunt, prewired. 10X10 Explosion proof
6) 12" full opening W X W hot tap valve 600# - Cooper valves are preferred vendor by material management on all valves.
7) 3 - 8" full opening ball valves 600#
8) 2 - 10" full opening ball valves with operators 600#
9) Rosemont's smart transmitters for pressure, diff and temp.
10) 8" Becker flow control valve 600#
We are checking delivery on the items currently, but if they can expiate, it would help.

Thanks

The in-service date of May 1, will be very difficult to attain. Since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid (Daniels, Fisher, Rosemont, other). These are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect. Questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery. (From time PA approved and funded to in-service will be 75 days at most. We have worked with Daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone. Daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered. Not the usual mode of operations. 
The I/C design is for a UltraSonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule ( Canada or Kansas are the only two places to test to 100% of design). Will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with UltraSonic ASAP. 
We will try to complete the I/C with the earliest in-service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be June 15, 2002. 
If you have questions or issues, please let me know.

Thanks

Earl,

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent Enron events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

Thanks, Kim.

Has a location, Theirs or TW land/ROW, been settled and when is the required in-service date?

All,

Please see the attached Interconnect Agreement with Questar.  I wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.  It is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with Questar.  Transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.  You will notice that Questar has requested a "Payment Plan" that details when they will pay Transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent Enron events.  If anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.  Also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the CIAC tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in Para 3.2 that protects us financially if the IRS ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the CIAC tax.   Robert Guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.  

We hope to execute this Agreement this week.  If you have any comments, please let me know.  After execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.

Thanks,

Dear Colleague,

The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California
Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is
available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com
<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper.

Here is a summary of the paper:

        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 

        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Mark, I reviewed my files and did not find the Dandby section.  I don't believe that I looked in the asset book.  Check with Jim Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn't in the file)  - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff.  

Kim.
I got a call from Questar's Jodi Starling this morning.  She said an original document is missig from the data room and was wondering if someone brought it home by mistake.

The missing information is the Dandby section from the Asset Binder.  It had a grey card-stock cover.  We can certainly keep a copy but they need the original back.  With all of the paper floating around the tables, it is likely to have been mixed up with some copies that were given to us.  Anyway, please check your stuff and see if this got in there.

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION

FROM GREG PORTER

We have agreed with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group lead by Rick Miles, to meet in Chicago on December 4, 2001 to begin mediation.  In anticipation of mediation, over the next month we will be meeting to prepare our mediation presentation and discuss potential settlement scenarios and strategies. We will have a better sense after the mediation session on December 4th whether SoCalGas is serious about its desire to resolve this proceeding amicably.  SoCalGas' lawyer has represented to me that they are interested in settlement and "prepared at some level" to compromise.  

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Settlement discussions have hit the wall.  Conoco, the third of the Indicated Shippers the commercial group was going to talk to, cancelled their Friday meeting stating that their regulatory folks told them they shouldn't meet with Transwestern (Re: Negotiated Rate Proceeding) unless all of the indicated shippers were present... never mind the fact that TW had already met individually with BP/Amoco and Burlington.

Exceptions to the October 24, 2001 Initial Decision are due by Thursday, November 8, 2001.  TW will need to response with in seven days.  I have asked Steve Stojic, with the assistance of Maria, to circulate the first draft.  

Any questions, please let me know.  Greg

Glen,

Can you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?

Many thanks, Kim.

New Peaking Rate for SoCalGas Could Spur Bypass 
After various fits and starts surrounding the issue over a number of months, California regulators Thursday established an alternative demand stand-by charge, called a "peaking rate," for Southern California Gas Co., which could open up the utility to "economic bypass" by interstate pipeline projects lined up and ready to go at the border. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility's own proposal as "anti-competitive." 
"This case has been very contentious," said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. "For the most part, the response to SoCal's application was negative." Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas. 
Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call "economic bypass," said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas' proposals did not "reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact. 
A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp.'s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine's Sonoran pipe to San Francisco.
Up to this point the utility's residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous. 
The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body's commissioners absent. 
The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received. 
Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities. 
"The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas' standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis," Lynch said. "We're changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day. 
"The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal's service territory. 
"We're trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for," Lynch added. 

FYI, Kim.

thanks so much.  Maria

Lindy, would you like for me to send Michelle to this meeting?  Should you both go?  Let me know what your preference is.  

Thanks, Kim.

Thanks for everyone's help on this and I apologize for being so late in answering back . We've been on team reviews for the last couple of weeks, doing reviews during the day and traveling to next location. I agree that we should approach them from the Special Service side. At this time we have our yearly meeting set up for Nov. 12th but this could change. Todd Stubbs is ready but Bob Checketts is having problems scheduling this week. He's tied up on a security task force for their company. Todd should let me know this week if we're still on for the 12th.  Lindy do you or someone else plan to attend the meeting? If not I'll plan to visit with Todd and see how he reacts to the facility upgrade if that's OK with everyone. I'm still not sure if we plan to do this next year but will find out this week and let you know.

Normally we have our meeting by September 1st but NW was setting it up this year and November was targeted for a meeting. I'll give you a call on Monday and we can discuss. Do you think we need a conference call to discuss?

Thanks
RJ

I agree with using your Special Services assessment. It's not an expansion as there is no increase in certificated capacity. So nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

FYI, Kim.

How does this look?

 

Steve, 

Was Lorraine able to get you an answer before she left?  I know she had a few calls into Nevada Power.  Let me know if you need me to do anything on this in her absence.  

Kim.

Can you please find out who the person(s) in charge of fuel procurement for Nevada Power currently is? Name, phone number and title would help (either someone at the director or VP level). Thanks.  

The last time I spoke with anyone at NP was about 2 yrs. ago.  John Olenick was against any more FT because of the impending dereg.  To my knowledge, no one at Las Vegas Cogen has been approached directly.

Who at Nevada Power are we talking to about capacity? Las Vegas Cogen?

Steve - In response to your previous questions regarding customers behind SWG.  SWG's largest customers are power plants.

	Nevada Power (still owns generation)
	El Dorado (Reliant and Sempra)
	Nevada Cogen Assoc. (NCA1 & 2) (partially owned by Texaco)
	Saguro Power Plant (NRG partially owns)
	Las Vegas Cogen (Enron involved?)
	
Parties who are either planning to build new power plants or are already building power plants in the Southern Nevada area include
Mirant
Reliant
Calpine
PG&E

APS/Pinnacle West was among the buyers of one of Nevada Power's plants before dereg in NV was postponed.

Please let me know if you need other info.

Lorraine 

Kevin,

What was the offer price from KMI on the Sonoran Pipeline Project?

Kim.

I will be travelling on 11/12 so here's the update:

Sonoran Pipeline -  Received offer price from Kinder Morgan to purchase capacity on their project.
Marketing -
	Panda Energy - Presented capacity offer to Panda on 11/6.  They liked the swing capability, but fuel is an issue.  They will present the offer to their partner 	TECO.  We expect their counter offer by week end 11/16.
	AZ Public Service -  Scheduled next meeting for 11/16 in Phoenix.  Working on finishing Pre-pay and SFV rate designs.
El Paso / FERC  - No word yet on direction of Full Requirements settlement.
Copper Eagle Gas Storage - No word yet on our submitted bid.

Leave me a voicemail if you have questions.

Can you forward to Paul... 

Ticket 32879 assigned to Robert Barker to install these

Karon -- what is the status of Paul's flat panels?
 
I know but... this name is not simple to spell or remember.   His name is Paul Y'Barbo.   
 
Jean,
It will be very beneficial if you could come up with the names.
 
Thanks,

Paul... something.  I'll try and get his last name.
Jean,
What are the names for the new persons? It makes it easier to know up front so we can have the tech dispatch the equipment.
 
Larry

Karon - please order another card and 2 flat panels for the new person in Kim Watson's group.   Thanks.  Jean

This will probably be under $500. Can you add this to another order?

Karon -- How about you order a 2 extra of the standard dual video cards and charge to 179002.go.mkgt code... that way I'll always have some ready since they are so hard to get in a timely manner.  ????

TK,

Let's visit on what this may mean for TW opportunities for Dec. business.

Thanks, Kim.

In its preliminary notice of November maintenance, El Paso had scheduled Lines 1300 and 1301 on the San Juan Crossover for total shutdown Nov. 29-30. It said Wednesday the shutdown has been delayed to coincide with the Dec. 1-2 weekend, when all 650 MMcf/d of the crossover's capacity will be cut to zero. Portions of Line 1300 will be shutting down Dec. 11-12 and Dec. 18-19; capacity cuts then will be 60 MMcf/d. 

Lindy,

FYI.  Kim.

No magic to the 9%.  We could use any reasonable rate as long as we are con=
ceptually consistent in future situations.  I.e.,  we could use the FERC in=
terest rate here if we were willing to always use it in contract terminatio=
n situations.  Or, if we use a rate here that is X basis points over some g=
enerally accepted benchmark (FERC interest rate? prime?  LIBOR?) we'd have =
a tough time justifying use of a significantly different mechanism (even th=
ough the actual rate in the subsequent deal might be a lot different due to=
 interest rate movement).  df=20

We should give Maverix the option of paying the discounted sum up front or =
doing a keep whole payment each month of the transaction.    I like the 9% =
discount rate for Maverix but would not be happy with such from an outsider=
.    Is there a basis in the 9% rate?

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement =
under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation=
 contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue s=
hortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer a=
t the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows T=
W to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financi=
al risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release =
them from their contract obligations without penalty. =20

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the =
TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance th=
at a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came fr=
om.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that =
 "capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons inc=
luding contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR=
 rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as=
 soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity."  If the questioning=
 customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent =
policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any =
other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, =
if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, t=
he confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should=
 be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants m=
ore detail, is that "Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business =
of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business an=
d terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract terminati=

Hi Kim,

	Did that procedure work for you?

I'm sorry, I havn't loaded this yet.  Have no fear, I will call you.  Many thanks for your persistance!  Kim.

Hi Kim,

	Did those instructions help you get your Business Objects file locations configured Ok?

Thanks,

Hi Ed,

Gosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? 

I will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.

Kim.

Hi Kim,

	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.

Thanks,
-Ed

FYI, Kim.

fyi

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K.

...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just
talked to Bob Corrigan and scheduled to meet him for lunch and we could both
see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...

Dennis,

Thank you for your kind note.  It is amazing how our pets become so much a part of our lives.  John has talked me into going to the cat show which happens to be in town this weekend.  Of course, we will pay special attention to the Turkish Angora breed.  Thanks for your thoughts.  

K. 

...to hear about Herschel.

You were really lucky to have such a fine lad in your lives for so many 
years, but I know that doesn't help a bit right now, and I know nothing I 
write will help a bit either.  He was a very, very cool cat [and he knew it, 
too].  The "penthouse" fit him to a "T".

Just know that I am feeling for you both.  We lost Coco about this time last 
November and I still miss him every day.

Take care.

Thanx,
Dennis

As of 11/11/01 SoCal's oba is a receivable of 358,416 mmbtus.  I know that we do not control the Needles point; however ????

SoCal's oba remains volumetric and a drop in index prices would cause a large dollar hit.

Mark,

This looks fine.  

Kim.

Rob Cooper (of US Gypsum) asked me to send him an email concerning our decision to not to force USG to provide the remaining 8 months of LOC and also asked me to verify a couple of other points.  Below is my reply.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  Paul, please provide the dollar amount needed in the blank below.
______________________________________________________________--

Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $___________ letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $__________ is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

Mark

Paula, 
I can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If Jim would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  Paula, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!  

Don had the highest vote (4th place.)

The board does not have to pick Don. As you recall, the board elected Kim to 
replace Muffin, and Kim had not even run for the board. 

Lew told me this morning that Jim is waiting to know who his replacement is 
before he resigns.

What time are we meeting? Where? Who?

I will be on vacation this day, however, I am planning on coming in for the board meeting in the evening.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Phyllis!

I am so excited to get to see you this weekend!  I sure hope all is well with you.  It looks like you and I have been assigned the dinner for Saturday evening.  I am open to ideas for recipes!  Let me know when would be a good time to visit on our assignment.  I will make time for you anytime.

DIRECTIONS FROM LISA:

Hello Everyone-  Here are detailed directions to the beach cabin for the
Nov. 30  girl's weekend.

Directions to the Polk Beach Cabin:

Go south on IH-45.

Take the Harborside Dr. exit when you get to Galveston and turn left
under the highway (this is the first exit after crossing the causeway,
so be watching for it).

Travel approx. 6 miles on Harborside Dr. to Ferry Rd.

Turn left on Ferry Rd., go to the end, and catch the ferry to Bolivar (
this is a free drive-on ferry operated by the Texas Hwy Dept.).

After exiting the ferry you will be on Bolivar Peninsula Hwy 87.  Travel
approximately 11.5 miles to the Emerald II edition (the Crystal Beach
water tower is a good land mark when you are getting close and the
Emerald II edition is the first road after the post office).

Turn right into Emerald II (there is a small green sign).  After
entering, turn left on Flamingo, and follow the curve around to
Eastview.  The cabin is on the right about half way down and is located
on the corner of Eastview and Crestview.  The address is 919 Eastview
and "J.S. Polk" is written on the side.

The telephone # is 409-684-0195.

I'm looking forward to seeing everyone!!

Mary Kay,

What is the usual process on something like this?  Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?  What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?  What is the timeline for FERC to decide?  

Thanks, Kim.

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.  

Drew,

If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW t=
hen take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible=
 for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity =
in different packages of time.   KW.

Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement =
under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation=
 contracts.  Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue s=
hortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer a=
t the same or better rate within 60 days.  I believe this approach allows T=
W to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financi=
al risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release =
them from their contract obligations without penalty. =20

Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the =
TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.  There is some chance th=
at a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came fr=
om.  I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that =
 "capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons inc=
luding contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR=
 rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.  Such capacity is posted on the EBB as=
 soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity."  If the questioning=
 customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent =
policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any =
other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.  Of course, =
if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, t=
he confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should=
 be disclosed.  The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants m=
ore detail, is that "Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business =
of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business an=
d terminating its contracts.  Transwestern has agreed to contract terminati=
on subject to an indemnity or "keep whole" mechanism."=20

I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.  I will follow=
 up on this later today.  DF=20

Hi,

The new grandbaby Samantha, her mother and father are doing fine. She is on her way home this afternoon if the pediatrician believes that she is ready to be released.

Regarding Jim's resignation, I agree that we should not be pressured into putting anyone on the board that will not assist us in moving forward and handling the complex issues that the board faces this year. Jim indicated that he would wait to resign for as long as he could or until we find a replacement. We can discuss this further tonight. I'm available anytime after 6:30 pm. We could either get together or all go out to dinner at Hungrey's or where ever if that works. Since the candidates to replace Jew Don Bony are coming to the Spires tomorrow night, I would like to attend that meeting if everyone is agreeable.

Let me know what works for this evening with everyone.

Yes, the flow affects of the Station 2 tie-ins for Red Rock. The estimated =

The tie-in for the Gray Co. I/C will call for a 2 day outage at P3. (11/29/=

FYI, Kim.

Here is the protest-  MK

Attached is the CPUC's Protest, Notice of Intervention and Request for Tech. Conference and/or hearing filed yesterday in RP97-288-017.

The CPUC is protesting the revised tariff sheets filed Oct. 31.

In a nutshell, the CPUC argues "the fundamental issue that should be investigated  is whether the maximum recourse rate is in fact functioning as the FERC intended to assure fair and reasonable use of negotiated rates by a pipeline with market power."

 

FYI, Kim.

Biggest impact was lower retained fuel volumes.  Overall impact is around $=
45K - $50K.

Hey Kevin,

Thanks for the message.  In fact, I talked with Glenn Hass about this earlier today.  I also talked to Questar about this today as well.  Gary Schmitt was somewhat optimistic, but he had not seen the full order yet so he was still reserved.  I'll keep you posted.  

Thanks,
Kim.

Kevin,

As a follow up to our recent discussions concerning the SoCalGas RLS or
peaking rate, I am forwarding to you the proposed decision of ALJ Brown.  My
understanding is that at yesterday's Commission meeting the Commission made
a decision to approve a change to the current peaking rate tariff.  I should
have their decision within a couple working days.  I am forwarding their
draft decision.

The expected PD rate design for the new peaking rate would include SFV rate
design principals, demand charges determined over highest recorded usage
over a 12 month period, and inclusion of public purpose program charges.  At
this point we'll call it a modified cost of service approach.

If you have any questions, please call.

Mark Baldwin

I attempted to contact both of you via phone and was unsuccessful, hence the e-mail. Did not wish for this to fall through the cracks.  Thanks, John Toews, OCC

Paula,

Although we skimmed the surface on board replacements for Jim, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:

Bill Tarter
Lenore Fenberg
Muffin Alfred

Any other names that come to mind?

.....Will Eucker, Art, Tammi Semi, Carolyn Brown, Ken O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?

Thanks, Kim. 

You sure can. How about meeting in the lobby at 6:30 PM.

I believe Dave N. and Sue had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw Dave in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. 
I've got two calls into Tom Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, James has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow.  
The Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.  Is it possible to take a company plane out with reps from mgmt, mktg, gas logistics and operations?  
We are also running a few more scenarios for TransPecos.

Thanks, Kim.

Lindy, FYI, I have a call into Tiny to discuss this picture and the ownership of the pipe in question.  Thanks, Kim.

The Interconnect would be downstream of the El Paso take off from the Ignacio lateral..   The drawing attached if pretty crude but....... this is what I was talking about..

 
The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

Audrey, here they are....

 

FYI. K.

Texas A&M football practice was delayed this morning for nearly two hours.
One of the players, while on the way to the locker room happened to look
down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown powdery substance on the
practice field. Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while
the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the
FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was actually
the goal line.  Practice resumed when the FBI agents decided that the team
was not likely to encounter the substance again.

Ha! Ha!

Lindy, thanks for looking into this.  I agree with your comments.  Kim.

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the "direction" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		"If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties."

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Lindy , can you please take a look at this and let me know if we should file comments. Thanks. You might see if Glen has looked at it yet.

	Steve

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Hi Dot.

Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)

	--Dot

Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is 
due to our analysis and advice.

I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything?

As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of 
young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in 
my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but 
our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C 
swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr 
third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 
point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him 
as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to 
you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really 
would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your 
own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move 
nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good 
photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 
281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out.

Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next 
year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet.

Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as 
scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell?

Later,

Charlie

Good morning Ms. Adams,

Please see the note below from Iris Meunier regarding the Gas & Power Trading 
Calendar.  Please advise of the following three questions:
would you like to take ownership of the Calendar;
should the Calendar still be in use; and
can V. Charles Weldon be given access to the Calendar.

We thank you for your time and assistance.

Hi everyone, and sorry for the delays all this is causing...

The G&P calendar has not been used for months (ie.:  at least for the past 2 
years...!).  I would not foresee any inconvenience with anyone using it.
The request originally came almost 3 years ago from when I was working in 
London (for the Gas & Power Trading groups).  Since then, I have moved to the 
Madrid office and Lauren Urquhart has replaced me (with ext. 7359).

I would suggest you maybe get in touch with Rachel Adams and see if she would 
like to become the new "owner" of this calendar (if she sees any current 
benefit in still having one), considering her important role on the trading 
floor in London.  

You can go ahead and erase my name from the owner list once you have a new 
one.

Best regards,
Iris

Sorry I did not get to call last night.  I'll try tonight after 8:00.

Can you please call Fidelity at 1-800-544-6666 and update my address?
Your duplicate statements have been going to my old address in Austin.  My 
new address is 13006 Brayton Court, Houstno, TX 77065.

You will also need to sell $2000 of stocks in your Bidwell account and make 
your 2001 IRA  contribution to this IRA account as we have done the last 
several years.  We'll talk about what to sell later.

Love,

Charlie 

The taxes that you owe will be based on any gain on whatever we sell.  It 
will be much less than $2000.  For instance, if we bought $1500 of Enron 
stock that is noe worth $2000 then you will only pay tax on the $500 gain.  
I'll look at it tonight.

got my money back..   i offerred 2 at 3-1/8 and they were gone in 5 minutes   
now I'm playing with profit and can let em ride.

She hasn't heard it yet as she was feeling so bad yesterday.  I'll take the 
pix tonight and see if I can get a CD done.   I'll get the invitation next 
time I can bare to be around you.

Dude,

When Melissa gets her pictures developed, can you see if they can put
them on a CD?  That's what Kathleen is doing, and it will make things a
lot easier since we can avoid the scanning process.

What did she think of the audio?

Finally, I still have your "invitation" that you bought at the airport.
It was a good thing to buy because the one I received in the mail is
just like it.

1816?  I have no idea. 

I knew there was such a year but did not know which one

No problme.  I enjoy helping out.  Just tell them to send you $2000.  You 
should have at least that in cash.  If there is any extra leftover and you 
need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.  Enron is 
up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.  Love,  Charlie

Margaret Jones <mjones@gc.edu> on 01/24/2001 09:24:02 AM
Charlie, I got your pictures - thank you - they were neat and I am
looking forward to the rest of them.  I am anxious to hear about your
trip but I know that you are probably still trying to recuperate from
your trip so call me when you feel rested.  I have class tonight and
will leave about 3:00 and won't get home until 11:00 so obviously
tonight won't be good.  When I call to sell my Merck and 5 shares of
Enron will they send me a check?  I can't remember how it works.  Once
again I want to thank you for watching out for me and my family with
these investments - I know it is time consuming but very much
appreciated.  God Bless You!  Love, Margaret

Thanks Kevin.  It has been very rewarding working here.   You are truly a 
valuable asset to this company and I appreciate all your help and efficiency.

Loftus,

Here's the file.  If you break the date column up into three separate columns 
for month, day, and year then you can use subtotals and/or pivot tables to 
analyze the data a little more quickly and dynamically.  For example, you 
might want to look at the extremes or averages for any particular month or 
year or whatever.  I c an help you do this if you want.    Remember that this 
is a very limited data set statistically speaking, especially considering 
that the last 3 winters were far above normal.  If you want to investigate 
what the possible extreme scenarios are based on past history then I can get 
you the data for many decades further back if wish.  Just let mw know.

Thanks,

Charlie

I have a meeting in Cuero at 10:00 am this Saturday that will last only an 
hour or so.  Other than that, we have no reason to go.  Maybe you could fly 
me to that?
If so, I'll need to ask Melissa.  She would not haev to go in that case and 
can stay and recuperate.

I need to check with Melissa first.  I'll call her now.

Hold off on the reservations as I cannot get hold of her.  She may want to 
drive for another reason I don't know of.  How long would we have to decide 
if we did want to fly.  Also, could Melissa and Hunter go also.

Here's a link to the data.  I'll come over there and show you where it is 
exactly

http://gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp

I'm going to get some scanned shortly.  Didn't get the CD.

Can there not be an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 
forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 
on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great 
market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, 
right?  What's your view?

The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this 
is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got 
the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin 
pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high 
growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of 
the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting.

Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This 
could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity.

Ok.  I'm in a class the last two days so E-mail access is limited.  Looks 
like rain tomorrow so i doubt flying will work, huh?

I'll call you this evening.  I'll be on this e-mail for 5 more minutes.

I'm in Deriv 3 class.  I just sold my remaining 2 contracts @4 3/8.  NOt too 
bad

Sounds like Goldman has a pretty low opinion of Dupont's management.  not 
surprising.....

	

Okay the results are in, and they are ugly.
 Enron's offer acceptance rate from UT was a whopping 2 candidates this year.

This is out of 9 offers extended!

I sent an email hoping to spike interest in the UT team to go to Austin, 
generate interest in first year candidates and to have fun over a few toddies 
before interviews.

So far I have had no confirmed response for this event.  Please keep in mind, 
for this to be a successful Spring recruiting season the participation of 
team members is needed.  Even though a major complaint from candidates was 
our salary ranges, I also feel the team and I did a poor job of candidate 
cultivation. Campus recruiting is fun, but it also takes dedication and team 
work.  We must really show a strong presence on campus this Spring in order 
to show the candidates how exciting Enron truly can be.  Part of the 
attraction for any candidate is to work for a company whose employees have 
fun attitudes and personalities.  I know most of you possess these attributes 
so lets take that to campus and get some awesome intern candidates!

In order to help solve the schedule problems that some of you expressed I am 
changing the date.  Please see below:

What:  First Year Candidate Cultivation and Targeting Opportunity

When:  Tuesday, February 6th

Where:  Scholz's Bier Garten, or Fado Irish Pub

Time:  7:00pm to ?

We will hold this event on a Tuesday since we can partner it with the Eyes of 
Texas Career Fair and because the closed list is due 2 days later.  The whole 
purpose of this event is to gather names of interested and qualified 
candidates and to get Enron's name back on campus.

*  If you are able to attend the Eyes of Texas Career Fair as well that event 
will begin at 2pm and end at 5:30pm. 

If you are interested and/or have suggestions on how to make this event more 
successful please contact me immediately.  

Thank you,

Hey Dude,

How was the superbowl gathering?  You were cracking me up when I called
the other evening.  Next time, just tell Melissa to let you sleep. :)

This weekend was pretty low key.  I purchased some really good books on
web marketing.  I've been studying them, and in the next couple of
months, I'm going to put together an agressive plan to market the web
site.  I will send you copies of the details for your review.

In the meantime there is some computer coding and other structural stuff
I need to get in place for the web site to be easier to maintain and
update.

I 'm pretty sure that we made an equity investment in a fuel cell company but 
I'm not sure which one.  We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy 
technology investment opportunities so I'm confifdent we won't miss out on 
any opportunity in this market.

Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or 
think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really.  
If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present 
or something.  

Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet 
so it should be perfect.

I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not 
totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.

weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high=

regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary author=
s=20
of this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State=20

Kristin,

Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you 
requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in 
many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other 
stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not 
the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate 
stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume 
whoever needs this info has one.

Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good 
representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be 
perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better 
data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though)

Thanks,

Charlie

December 2000, "Worth" magazine=20
=20
Energy giant Enron is expanding its powerful trading platform into the hear=
t=20
of the new economy.=20
 =20
Enron (NYSE: ENE) President and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling=20
hates his office, a spacious lair on the 50th floor of the energy company's=
=20
downtown
Houston headquarters overlooking the flat Texas terrain. To Skilling, its=
=20
haughty vastness is a vestige of the old mind-set from the days when energy=
=20
markets=20
were highly regulated. Instead, he prefers strolling through Enron's three=
=20
commodity-trading floors =01* the company's nerve centers, where it buys an=
d=20
sells products=20
ranging from natural gas to electricity to communications bandwidth. The=20
often casually dressed Skilling is clearly in his element talking with the=
=20
traders. "That's=20
how you find out what's going on," he says.

Skilling doesn't think like an old-line energy executive, nor does Enron ac=
t=20
like an old-line energy company. With its eclectic product mix and strong=
=20
online
 presence, Enron has become a leader of a new breed of energy company tryin=
g=20
to capitalize on deregulation. The ongoing unshackling of the natural gas=
=20
and electric power markets that began in the mid-1980s has left both=20
industries in a tizzy: A dearth of new power supplies, combined with=20
insatiable demand,=20
has jacked up gas and electric prices and put the squeeze on suppliers and=
=20
their customers. That suits Enron just fine.

New Economy Initiatives
The company, which 10 years ago earned some 80 percent of its profits from=
=20
its regulated gas-pipeline business, has become the nation's largest buyer
 and seller of natural gas and electric power and has pioneered a powerful=
=20
trading platform to make effective markets in both commodities. But what ha=
s=20
really electrified Wall Street during the past year are Enron's new-economy=
=20
initiatives. First, it launched EnronOnline, an Internet-based energy-tradi=
ng=20
system, in November 1999. By mid-October 2000, the new venture had executed=
=20
more than 350,000 transactions with a gross value totaling $183 billion.=20
Next it unveiled its strategy to become a dominant broadband player by both=
=20
delivering content along its own sizable fiber-optic network and trading
 bandwidth as a commodity. The nascent broadband services group had $345=20
million in revenue for the first nine months of this year.

Although energy remains Enron's main source of revenue and earnings,=20
management believes the growth of the Internet will enable the company to t=
ap
 into new markets. "In five years, we will be a substantially different=20
company," says chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay. "Underlying=20
everything we=20
do is the ability to make markets more efficient." Along with bandwidth,=20
Enron has added such mundane commodities as steel, and pulp and paper to it=
s=20
trading platform, which will soon include such esoteric fare as DRAM chips=
=20
and data storage. "Trading is the ultimate scalable concept," adds Skilling=
.=20
"We're
 using the same computer systems, processes, controls and people. The=20
potential to expand into new markets is almost unlimited."

Investors have bought into Enron's vision and sent its shares soaring, whic=
h=20
at a recent price of $80 were up 85 percent since the beginning of 2000. Th=
e=20
big
 question, of course, is how much of that euphoria is already built into=20
Enron's stock price and what happens if the company's broadband strategy=20
doesn't=20
unfold as quickly =01* or become as huge =01* as the company anticipates.

"We are a unique company with a unique set of skills that are perfectly=20
suited for the changing economy."
=01* Jeff Skilling, President and COO, Enron

Company Culture
Enron is a company that firmly believes in itself and its mission. From=20
management down, employees have little doubt that they're creating=20
revolutionary
 new businesses. This strong sense of purpose is evident everywhere at=20
Enron's headquarters, where throughout the day workers eagerly stop by a=20
ticker-tape kiosk in the main lobby to check on Enron's stock price.

Management
Ken Lay, 57, assumed the top job at Enron in February 1986, not long after=
=20
the company was formed by the merger of Internorth and Houston Natural Gas,=
=20
where he had been chairman and CEO. The two pipeline companies had joined=
=20
forces to compete better as the wholesale natural gas market was being
deregulated. In the past, government authorities set the price that utiliti=
es=20
could charge for gas, and customers were bound by rigid, long-term contract=
s.=20
But=20
with deregulation, the market determines energy prices, and both suppliers=
=20
and consumers have more flexibility in how they buy and deliver goods. The
 new Enron moved swiftly to cash in on these changing dynamics by creating =
a=20
trading platform to bring together buyers and sellers. Enron repeated the=
=20
process with electricity when the government began deregulating that market=
=20
in the 1990s.

Lay has long been hailed as Enron's visionary, but COO Skilling is no slouc=
h.=20
"Jeff is one of the brightest and most creative people I've ever known," sa=
ys=20
Lay,=20
who began working with him in the mid-1980s when Skilling was a McKinsey=20
consultant helping Enron develop its gas-trading system. "I've made it clea=
r=20
for
 some time that he's my successor." The 46-year-old Skilling, who officiall=
y=20
joined Enron in 1990, likes to toss around words like awesome and cool when
 describing the company's business. Lay's language is slightly less colorfu=
l=20
but no less enthusiastic when the CEO is talking about Enron's future.

Lay and Skilling both agree that the best ideas often come up from the=20
bottom. "We've flattened the organization, made it more entrepreneurial, an=
d=20
developed a culture to take risks and try new ideas," Lay says. Take Michae=
l=20
Moulton, 30, who is working in Enron's pulp-and-paper trading unit. Moulton=
=20
came up with the notion to make markets in DRAM chips, and when the new uni=
t=20
begins its operations later this year, he will run it.

Wholesale Energy
Despite its broad range of businesses and expansive aspirations, Enron is=
=20
still at its core an energy company. During the first nine months of this=
=20
year,=20
nearly $56 billion of its $60 billion in revenue came from its wholesale=20
energy operation, which centers around making markets in and creating=20
risk-management=20
products for natural gas and electricity. Some of what Enron sells comes fr=
om=20
its own gas production and electric-power generation, but the bulk of it is=
=20
bought=20
from other energy producers with excess capacity.

The company's trading capacity has gotten a tremendous boost from=20
EnronOnline, which now handles about 60 percent of its transaction volume.=
=20
Margins
 are razor-thin =01* maybe a penny per million BTUs of gas or per megawatt =
of=20
electricity (standard contract measures). But Enron isn't doing trades just=
=20
to=20
make money; it does them to create liquid spot markets that in turn enable =
it=20
to package together risk-management products, such as futures and swap=20
contracts, that companies can use to hedge their energy costs. Enron is a=
=20
principal in every trade, taking full responsibility for actual delivery of=
=20
the product,=20
be it gas, electricity, or even pulp and paper. Overall margins in the=20
wholesale energy business average one to three percent.

Trading is a risky business, of course, but few companies manage risk bette=
r=20
than Enron, which has armies of people working to stay on top of sudden pri=
ce=20
moves. "Enron seems to make all the right calls because it has the best=20
modeling systems, hires the brightest people, and has trading experience=20
throughout=20
the country," says Gregory Phelps, a portfolio manager at John Hancock Fund=
s=20
who closely follows the utilities sector. Enron employs a dozen=20
meteorologists=20
on its gas-trading floor to monitor any weather changes =01* from an oncomi=
ng=20
cold snap in Chicago to a potential hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico =01* th=
at=20
could affect=20
supply and demand.

Now Enron has turned its sights on Europe, which is in the early stages of=
=20
deregulation. Enron established a presence in the U.K., Germany and=20
Scandinavia=20
in the early to mid-1990s. It currently has 18 offices in 16 countries,=20
making markets and hedging risks in a region where state-owned utilities=20
still loom large and=20
national differences present formidable hurdles. "We're the only company wi=
th=20
pan-European operations," says Mark Frevert, who heads the wholesale energy
 unit. "There's a lot of complexity, but we like markets where it's=20
difficult."

Broadband Operations
The roots of Enron's bandwidth trading go back to 1997, when the company=20
bought Portland General Electric to gain a foothold in the West Coast energ=
y
 market. At the time, the utility was laying fiber-optic cable alongside it=
s=20
gas pipeline that ran between Portland and Salt Lake City, and as it was=20
being deployed,=20
"the Enron mind-set of 'Can we trade this stuff?' kicked in," says Kenneth=
=20
Rice, CEO of Enron Broadband Services. "Bandwidth lends itself well to bein=
g=20
traded like=20
a commodity."

Today Enron buys excess bandwidth from Internet service providers and from=
=20
carriers such as AT&T (NYSE: T), Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) and Qwest
 (NYSE: Q). As it does with energy, Enron bundles together bandwidth, then=
=20
sells and delivers it on an as-needed basis to content providers, network=
=20
carriers,
 and other end-users. Enron promises to deliver capacity at a set time and=
=20
for a specified period over a fiber-optic network that stretches nearly=20
15,000 miles
 and connects some 30 major cities in the United States, Europe,and Japan.

Enron is certainly ambitious. It wants to change the way bandwidth is sold,=
=20
which up until now has been in fixed-rate monthly contracts that lock buyer=
s=20
into=20
paying for capacity they don't always need. Enron provides bandwidth on=20
demand that users can purchase and procure on short notice for short period=
s=20
of=20
time =01* for instance, if a company wants to broadcast a streaming video o=
f its=20
CEO to its offices around the globe.

The company made its first bandwidth trade last December when it sold a=20
monthly contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o=
n=20
a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at=
 a=20
speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video.) Enron
 delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20
quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20
months. Both
 Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20
annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener=
gy=20
contributed=20
in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into=
=20
broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending=
=20
$2=20
billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP).

The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering=
=20
streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches
 made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,=
=20
along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system
 is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams. Content customers ran=
ge=20
from corporations doing video conferencing to retail chain Blockbuster (NYS=
E:=20
BBI),=20
which this summer inked a 20-year deal to distribute video-on-demand over=
=20
Enron's network. "Video will be the king application," Skilling says. "That=
's=20
where=20
it's all going to happen."

Other Growth Drivers
Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million=
=20
for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20
retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20
30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the=
=20
stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100=
=20
million in the process.

Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.S.=
=20
businesses spend more than $240 billion on heat and electricity to run thei=
r=20
operations every year. Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything=
=20
from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20
energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20
gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group
 (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5=
=20
billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate=
=20
properties. "The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're=
=20
going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail," says Marty Sunde,
head of the group's North American unit.

Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu=
t=20
sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20
in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings=
=20
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year. Enron is on=
=20
target to=20
land $16 billion in customer contracts in 2000, double last year's total.=
=20
"There's no reason this business can't roughly double in each of the next f=
ew=20
years,"=20
Lay says.

"Enron is very, very confident. Their tone borders on excessive confidence,=
=20
but their track record warrants that."
=01* Erik Gustafson, Senior Portfolio Manager, Stein Roe & Farnham

The Competition
Some of Enron's trading partners are also its biggest rivals in reshaping t=
he=20
deregulated energy markets and forging ahead in telecommunications.
 Dynegy (NYSE: DYN), located just a few blocks away from Enron in Houston a=
nd=20
called "Enron Jr." by at least one analyst, has its own gas- and=20
electricity-trading operations and is looking into bandwidth trading. The=
=20
same goes for Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), whose fiber-optic network is
 much larger than Enron's. A consortium of six energy companies, including=
=20
Aquila Energy, a leading power marketer, just launched an online=20
energy-trading=20
system to rival EnronOnline.

Several existing bandwidth traders, including Arbinet-thexchange,RateXchang=
e=20
(AMEX: RTX) and Band-X, essentially provide Web-based bulletin boards
 for companies to find trading partners. They don't actually deliver the=20
product, which Enron feels gives it an advantage. In the energy-services=20
business,=20
Enron competes with a whole host of players, including consultants, regiona=
l=20
utilities and energy outsourcers, but none have Enron's geographic scope.

"It's a challenge to value Enron's stock, because it's such a hybrid. It=20
always seems expensive, but it continues to outperform expectations."
=01* Zach Wagner, Analyst, Edward D. Jones & Co.

What It's Worth
Analysts and Enron management alike prefer to break down the company along=
=20
its four reported business lines using a sum-of-the-parts model. They=20
also typically value the company's businesses in terms of EBIT, judging tha=
t=20
to be a more consistent way to evaluate Enron's income because its business=
es
 are so capital intensive. Using those metrics and a recent stock price of=
=20
$80, Enron's pipeline transportation and distribution business is roughly=
=20
valued at $5,
wholesale energy at $40, energy services at $20 and broadband services at=
=20
$15. Skilling believes the multiple of 30 times EBIT assigned to wholesale=
=20
energy=20
is too low considering that business is expected to grow 35 percent this=20
year, to $1.8 billion, some 70 percent of Enron's projected total EBIT. And=
=20
wholesale=20
energy's EBIT growth is likely to exceed 30 percent annually for at least t=
he=20
next five years on the strength of further deregulation of global energy=20
markets.=20
Combine that with similar expected growth rates in both energy services and=
=20
broadband,=20
not to mention the potential for new commodity-trading markets, and, Skilli=
ng=20
argues, Enron's stock is easily worth $130.

Analysts are more cautious. Most agree that wholesale energy deserves a=20
higher premium than the market is currently willing to pay, but bandwidth i=
s=20
still=20
a couple of years away from profitability. In the meantime, Salomon Smith=
=20
Barney analyst Ray Niles suggests that investors focus on the market=20
potential=20
of bandwidth trading, and that the quick acceptance of this product in the=
=20
market could mirror the steady early growth of electricity trading in the=
=20
mid-1990s.
 Niles thinks Enron's overall energy operations alone are worth more than=
=20
Enron's current share price. If that's true, tacking on the $15 EBIT value=
=20
for bandwidth
 would make Enron a $100 stock.

Ultimately, many investors will look at plain old earnings per share. If=20
Enron meets analysts' consensus earnings forecast of $1.65 a share next yea=
r=20
=01* and
 maintains its current multiple of 56 times earnings =01* it would be worth=
 $92.

Social Responsibility
Enron has won awards each of the past three years for its efforts to reduce=
=20
methane emissions and has been applauded for its wind-power division. But=
=20
certain Enron projects, such as the construction of its Dabhol power plant =
in=20
India, have been mired in controversy. The state police there squelched=20
protests=20
against the plant in 1996 and 1997 with beatings and jailings, and Human=20
Rights Watch asserted that Enron was complicit because it benefited from th=
e=20
suppression of dissent and didn't speak out against human rights violations=
.=20
Enron has since built a 50-bed hospital in the area and committed $500,000
 to improve the community's water and sanitation infrastructures.

The Upside
With less than half of the residential power market in the U.S. open to=20
competition, electricity deregulation is far from over. Some analysts belie=
ve=20
the entire=20
market will be deregulated within five years. This would enable Enron to=20
expand its leading energy-trading business. On the retail side, Enron could=
=20
get a=20
boost from the New Power Company, a partnership it formed with AOL (NYSE:=
=20
AOL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) aimed at selling electricity to homeowners via
 the Internet. Enron's attempt to sell residential electricity in Californi=
a=20
ended in failure in 1998, and the company readily admits this isn't one of=
=20
its strengths.=20
So it's relying on IBM's back-office expertise to handle the paperwork and=
=20
AOL's Internet service to penetrate homes while Enron procures the power.

The Downside
The much-ballyhooed broadband revolution has failed to meet expectations.=
=20
Currently, only five percent of U.S. households have broadband access, and
 Forrester Research analyst Maribel Dolinov says the rollout of so-called=
=20
last-mile connections, which take broadband signals into homes, is moving=
=20
very=20
slowly. She doesn't expect wide-scale availability of video-on-demand befor=

Who Needs It?

This guy has amazingly good 20/20 hindsight.  He's painting the Fed as behind 
the times and inept at managing monetary policy in this New Economy.  In 
fact, it was Greenspan's willingness to embrace the New Economy's higher GDP 
"speed limit" and unemployment "floor" that enabled this unprecedented 
economic expansion.  While it is true that the Fed's tightening is largely 
responsible for this downturn, it is not solely responsible; and it is the 
Fed's nimbleness over the last month in reversing monetary policy that will 
prevent this downturn from being a mere bump in the road.

I got my W-2 but I haven't looked into the impact of moving on income.

I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.  He was pretty old 
and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and 
intelligent man.  About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont 
and I stayed over the weekend with him.  He took me all around Salt Lake City 
and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.  That's what I will remember about him 
most.

I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
it
is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
- it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
thinking
that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
Love, Margaret

I guess I would have shot him.

Look out for very cold temps by this weekend and next week.  Coldest in 4 
years.

	
	

Attached you can find a load factor analysis for Stagecoach.  This analysis 
shows MMBtus and KWhrs based on different loads for both the summer (June, 
July, and August)  and the winter months (September, October, November, 
december, January, February, March, April & May).  

Please notice that the heat rate equals 7,500 Btu/HPhr and the billing demand 
equals 10,980KW.

PLease don't hesitate to call me at 5-3269 if you have any questions.

Per Andrew, Let's plan on meeting (or at least touching base) on Thursday at 
3:00.  I'm attaching a revised summary and a spreadsheet derived from the one 
Maria sent me on Monday.  Please take time to review both documents to see if 
we're still heading down the right path....

Just fill out form and send $2000 in.  Contribution is for year 2001.  I've 
been real busy.

Margaret Jones <mjones@gc.edu> on 02/05/2001 09:20:53 AM
Charlie,  I received my check from Bidwell for $2,023. and some change.
I have an IRA form for my 2001 contribution from Fidelity.  Is there
anything I need to do besides fill out the form and mail a check?

I talked to Mama yesterday - she said your house was looking good.  I
signed Travis up for the Pony League baseball - it will be a lot
different from Little League and I think he is a little nervous but so
is everyone else that is moving up.  Elizabeth is doing the reading for
mass at school on Thursday - it is the first grade class turn again and
she did the responsorial psalm last time.  Her two main teachers told
the religion teacher that Elizabeth would have to read again because the
reading was long and complicated and Elizabeth was the only one that
would be capable of doing it.  I was really proud - not bad for a
daughter that was supposed to be retarded- I always feel like telling
the doctor's that they don't know everything.  Anyway, I hope you'll are
doing great and let me know about my contribution.  Love, Margaret

It's Saturday.  Will that work?

Lunch is likely. Call me then

Andrew,

Can we move tomorrow's meeting to 5:00 instead of 3:00?   I have a 
structuring class all day.  Mark will need to leave at ~5:30 so I'll try to 
be up here a little early if possible.  I'll send a nother note with a 
conference room if I can get one.  

Thanks,

Hi guys,

I received a few questions from EES on the gas side of the deal.  I know the 
answers to most of these, I was just wondering if you had any insight to the 
rest after our lunch meeting with Corey and Paul on Friday.  Let's discuss if 
you have a chance when I return on Thursday afternoon.  Can we keep this 
under wraps for now?  I don't want EES to ever think that I'm playing you 
guys against each other, I just want to make sure I don't go back to El Paso 
and ask questions they've already answered.

1.  What is the name of the delivery point?  If Ellisburg, can EES deliver 
this gas supply to any point at Ellisburg Storage?

2. Is the storage a firm service from TGP or interruptible?  If 
interruptible, will EES be told to remove supply from storage due to TGP Firm 
storage commitments?  What does interruptible mean?    

3.  How long can EES carry the volumes in storage?  What are the TGP "cost of 
carry" in storage?  What is the cost of pulling the gas out of storage?  Are 
there any "IN STORAGE"  transfer costs? 

4.  What is the maximum daily quantity EES can pull out of storage?

5.  What is the maximum storage capacity in Ellisburg for the Stagecoach 
project?  Can EES have access to this storage capacity at any time?  Can EES 
inject other gas volumes once the volumes allocated by El Paso are utilized?

6.  What are the possible other (alternate) delivery points? Will there be a 
basis difference from Ellisburg?  Will these alternate delivery points be 
firm deliveries?  What will the MDQ be at these points?  

7.  If possible, can EES "pick" an alternate delivery point as our primary 
point of delivery for this project? 

I'll be in touch on Thursday.  Charlie and I have 3:00 Thursday afternoon set 
aside - will this work for you Mark?

Thanks,

Andrew

I just bought some more CPN.  CEFT has a great 5 yr chart and doesn't seem 
too expensive but I don't understand their business risks as much as CPN so 
I'm going to stick with them.  I may give it some more thought if I could 
find a good research report on them.

I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.  It was 20 miles west of Menard 
on Hwy 190.  A great area that's for sure.

Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far:

1)  17", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest 
ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.

2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17", 11 point with a double main 
beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.

3) Travis shot a 16"  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.

We've seen more bucks than we have since '93.  More fawns than I ever 
remember.  Maybe things have turned around for awhile.  I've got some good 
videos I'll show sometime.  When are ya'll coming?

Let me know when the money is there and we will buy something

One less competitor............

I'll let you know where you can go.  Probably pretty much anywhere in Buddy's 
or I might can arrange for you to sit in another area.  It won't be a problem 
but we will need to communicate.

 Right now my friend Weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a 
deer in 6 years and has paid my Dad ~$5000 over the period.  Paul is still 
hunting in there too and that's where Travis killed his deer.  

Check out the following link on the weather:

Take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are 
automated and tend to spit out some garbage.  However, a true blue norther

  Worker Dead at Desk For 5 Days

     Bosses of a publishing firm are trying to work out why no one noticed
  that one of their employees had been sitting dead at his desk for FIVE
DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling okay.

     George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a proof-reader at a New
  York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack in the open-plan office he
  shared with 23 other workers. He quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody
  noticed until Saturday morning when an office cleaner asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.

      His boss Elliot Wachiaski said "George was always the first guy in
each morning and the last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that
  he was in the same position all that time and didn't say anything. He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself."

      A post mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five days
  after suffering a coronary. Ironically, George was proofreading
  manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

Here's the link to the gas fundamentals site:

http://gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp

John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas 
(9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the 
following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the 
CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The 
desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side 
of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    
It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the 
TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) 
size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Charlie

  

John,

Based on yesterday's (5/9/01) curves, and applying spreads from our previous 
quotes, the new updated notionl bid is $4.51/MMBTU.  Let me know if you need 
any more assistnace.

Thanks,

Charlie

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating 
that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged 
to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM 
method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Charlie

We'll probably come down on the 21st.  If you are still there then maybe we 
can hook up and go out there together and laugh away the deer.  

How does a January/February trip up to Grapevine sound?

Oh yeah, Melissa's pregnant.  Due first week in August.  It's early so we are 
being cautious but I figured you would want to know.

Congratualtions, Will!  May God bless you and your family.  She's a beautiful 
baby.

How is recruiting going?   Any idea where you think you will end up.  I'm 
sorry it did not work out at Enron.  I know that you will do well wherever 
you go.

Charlie

Up 8.5%!!!!, for now

Vince, 

Mr. Horn's request has been taken care of.  He has the data he wanted and 
knows how to call it up on his Bloomberg terminal in the future.

Charlie

Indeed.  If the weather models that run tonight confirm still are as 
intensely cold as today's and the present hint at another Arctic blast to 
directly at the East Coast next weekend continues then we could approach 
$10.  Pretty risky business here being short or long, eh?

A frozen precip event in the Deep South and Houston is not unlikely next 
week.

I saw it.   After our conversation, I did add some Citi and Wachovia and have 
since lost but I still think it's a good move.  Hopefully there will not be 
any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards 
the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.

 I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.  I'm pretty balanced 
now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).

ENE closing at $72+!!!!!

You ARE a professional

Hi guys,

Please treat this as strictly confidential

Please take action ASAP

As you all know, the Enron Associate 2001 offers haven't been very popular 
among MBAs. Given the fact that December is decisions month and that, given 
the company growth, we cannot afford lose a new breed of highly qualified 
people, the following has been decided:

Present a proposal to Jeff Skilling today in order to improve the current 
offers. The proposal will be presented this afternoon, after two 
Associates-Skilling-HR interactions (in which Skilling expressed more than 
once his concern about Enron offers being so low compared to the market 
...I-Banks, Consulting firms).

Select one alumni per B-School represented in the 2000 Associate Class, you!

Authorize those representatives to send a standard e-mail (text provided 
below) to the candidates who got offers in their respective B-Schools, in 
order to gain some time until the official HR communication (hopefully caring 
good news) is submitted.

The standard e-mail should read EXACTLY as follows (we are not authorized to 
change or add anything):

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

To MBA students considering joining the Enron Associate Program,

I wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that a proposal to change 
the Associate compensation package has recently been presented to Jeff 
Skilling.  A decision concerning the recommended change is expected in the 
next few days.  More information will be provided as soon as possible.  Have 
a nice weekend!

Regards,

Representative Signature

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

We are asking you to the send the e-mail under your name because we want this 
notification to be informal. We have the authorization to do it this way.

In case you are contacted by any candidate, the offical position should be 
consistent with the one in the e-mail: a decision is expected very soon, we 
will let you know asap.

Please bcc me when you send the message, since it is important to keep track 
about which B-School candidates have been notified.

Thanks a lot for your help and quick response,

Roberto Conterno

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Jim,

Are you going to invite the others?

I saw that too.  I agree on Ferguson but I think Toombs will have to show 
that he can play with all his heart  (and ass) every week.  He could be a 
Bettis type back if he stays committed.

In case you haev not heard, we are likely to have an ice storm here tomorow.

I would call this the Arctic Express.

I think Fergie will stay unless his grades knock him out.  In that case, I 
would say he is a third rounder or so, which ain't bad for 10 games in Div 
1-a!

ENE - 77!

I agree.  Even the best of accounting maneuvers will not be able to hide the 
fact that (if) EBS is not fundamentally successful.

 So the question is, is there a way to go long ENE and short EBS?  Probably 
not, but if there were a surrogate for EBS, the trade might work in most 
scenarios.  How about shorting a long-term broadband contract?

That's the irony

Ouch!

Thank You!

Tomorrow's another day.  Looks like I bought ARBA at the top.  

Todd,

Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get 
exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a 
genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more 
time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we 
need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.

Thanks,

Dave,

Just wondering if you have had a chance to consider these new risk management 
tools we are considering.

Thanks!

Dave,

Thanks for taking time to talk with me the other day.   To recap what I was
asking you to consider, we at  Enron currently have two different weather
derivative products under development that we believe could be of interest
to Dupont.   One of the products involves protection against
hurricane-related production disruptions.  The exact form of the product
could vary but would generally provide for coverage against lost revenues
due to hurricane warnings or general proximity of hurricanes near the
coastline.  We would be able to structure this offer with maximum
flexibility with regard to category of hurricane, level of coverage, exact
proximity, and pricing (swaps or options).

The other product line we are considering is a drought-related product that
keys off of low riverflow values on various river basins in Texas.   We
believe that the Guadalupe River in particular is susceptible to extremely
low riverflow values that could potentially result in production
disruptions to the downstream chemical industry that relies on the river to
meet cooling needs.  A review of 50 years of riverflow data (from the US
geological survey) suggests that if a drought of the magnitude of the one
in the 1950's were to reoccur, there is potential for multiple prolonged
production disruptions to many of the large chemical plants on this river,
including the Victoria Dupont plant.   The exact form of coverage offerred
would again depend on your specific needs.

Both of these products are in a stage that we need to determine whether or
not there is sufficient market interest to warrant further development.
Your feedback on whether or not these products might be of any interest to
you would be greatly appreciated.

On one other note, you mentioned that the agricultural business of Dupont
was considering some rainfall derivative contracts for hedging purposes.
We are very interested in discussing your needs versus our capabilities
with regard to this type of product.   Our marketing contact for this
subject is Valter Stoiani and he can be contacted by phone at 713-853-6906
or by E-mail at valter.stoiani@enron.com.

Thanks again,

try this link for the "official" view on the economy and future Fed actions 
from Enron's chief economist:  (It's a bit different than most)

I watched the whole game and was extremely impressed with Benson.   He 
definitely got good blocking but he showed power, speed, balance, vision.  I 
believe only an injury will prevent him from having massive success.  His 
interview after the game showed me that he's pretty mature also.  I'll take 
over 800 yds next year if you take under.

He sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about.  I'll 
be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good Hayter is.  BEnson is 
the 4th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great Robert 
Strait from Cuero (85-88) and almost passing Rodney Thomas.  Those guys don't 
get redshirted.

I'm befuddled about the O-line numbers.  Ya'll got this kid Winston this 
weekend over us even though we have only one OL commit and need 4 or so.  
Slocum  has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we 
are doomed.  2 of the top 3 linemen are still available and we've got a 
reasonable shot at them but Hightower (#1) still says he's going to visit and 
consider Texas.  Amazing...

will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Jonathan,

Hope you had a good Thanksgiving weekend.  I'd like to catch up with you 
today if possible regarding recruiting etc.  Can I reach you by phone.  If 
so, where?
You can call me toll free at 1-800-97-ENRON and follow the menu.   My 
extension is X57229 or you can use the voice activated system.

Thanks,

Charlie

Gary,

Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.

Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
opinion.

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001219/bs/rayovac_outlook_dc_1.html

One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of 
hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.

Please let me know how I may be of assistance.

Thanks,

Charlie

This is an excerpt from an internal Weather Channel (Landmark Communications) 
newsletter.....

BLIZZARDS PRODUCE HIGH RATINGS FOR WEATHER CHANNEL, RECORD PAGE VIEWS
More people turned to The Weather Channel instead of their local TV
affiliates to get news about this week's blizzards in Chicago and Detroit,
and nearly 25 million viewers - a record - went to  weather.com to follow
the storms.
           In a survey by Survey USA, 25 percent of TV viewers said they found
out about the blizzard from The Weather Channel, compared with 17 percent
who watched their local NBC affiliate station, and 12 percent who tuned into
a local radio station for news. TWC also was the winner - at 30 percent -
with those who said the weather network did the best job of covering the
storm. Another 16 percent said their NBC affiliate did the best job, and 13
percent said Chicago and Detroit CBS affiliates were tops.
           A record number of pageviews - 24.6 million - were recorded at
weather.com. TWC produced a 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. rating of 0.751 on Monday,
delivering an average of 586,000 households. This performance is well over
twice the average December monthly rating to date.
           Kansas City and St. Louis recorded the highest metered market
ratings during the blizzard, followed by Detroit. The Chicago rating also
was within the top 10.

Keep trying.  We are definitely interested.  How much does a pair of tickets 
to an inaugural ball run?

In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 
and buy the tickets for $125.   This does sound like a good one to go to 
based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.  I imagine 
(hope) that the other balls are comparable.

I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated. 

If we can't get Wilkerson, Hightower (both Top 5 nationally) and a decommit 
or two from Texas or somebody based on this news then our coaches are 
indeed pathetic salesmen. These guys can come in and start as redshirt frosh 
if not play as true freshmen, even though RC likes to redshirt all OL'men.

http://www.dallasnews.com/sports_day/colleges/football/243173_21amlede.html

We've got a 2-deep OL lineup for next year but I question the quality as only 
a few were legit blue-chips and I like the odds of getting bluechips versus 
sleepers.  I think we'll get one of the 2 studs and maybe both.  The main 
concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of 
dominate line play.  We've got the skill guys, DB's and LB's.

Slightly different subject,  check this link out.  Kiper seems to indicate 
that you must be a 3rd year soph or a junior to enter the draft.  Is this 
true?
  Does it mean rising junior or completed junior?  Implications for Roy W. 
and UT?

Had a great time this weekend.  I'm sure glad that Travis got another good 
buck under his belt.  I think he is now ready to move it up a notch on the 
next deer and if everything stays good at the ranch then it should be pretty 
possible next year.

I was also wondering if you and Mama talked about paying Melissa for her 
painting.  Mama mentioned to Melissa that she "owed" her but nothing more 
than that.  She worked for no less than 20 hours and was disappointed that 
she would not be able to do the rest of the house as we really need the 
money.  Our negative checking balance needs some injection of cash and 
Melissa had hoped to use the money to buy a few things for Christmas this 
week as well.   If you haven't already, I'm sure that you can broach the 
subject with Mama without letting her know that I asked.

Anyway,  Melissa really wanted to be able to paint more and is upset that she 
wasn't able to "prove" to Mama that she is willing and able to work hard.  
She still gets those not so subtle jabs all the time from Mama about not 
working outside the home.  For the record, she busts her ass keeping our 
house clean, clothes washed and ironed, meals cooked, and doing lots of 
things to make sure we have a happy, healthy, and well adjusted son.   If 
there is a way (later) that you can subtly encourage Mama to hold back on 
these jabs when we next visit, it will go a long way toward ensuring a good 
Christmas for everyone.

Anyway, definitely keep all of this confidential between me and you.  There 
is no major problem here but I wanted to check off with you on this so we can 
help keep everything going smooth and folks getting along.   I'm sure you see 
my point of view here.

Thanks!

Charlie

Just wanted to let you know that we will not be having any JA meetings
at Cy-Fair High School until about mid-January.  Paper work will
probably be returned to me hopefully around then and we will probably
start up our meetings again around January 15th or the 22nd.  I will be
sure and send you a meeting before then.

Also, we have been asked to do the Aquatic Gardens centerpieces for the
Texas Society of CPA's gala.  It is being held on January 30th at the
Hyatt Regency Downtown.  They have asked that we have everything set-up
no later than 5:00 p.m. that day.  I am in the process of trying to get
the vases possibly shipped to us direct from the manufacturer.  I have
also contacted a fish store about getting the Bettas than we will be
needing.

Is it possible that you might be able to get us a guest speaker to come
to the school in late January or early February?  In the past, we have
had some one from Human Resources, a marketing person and also an IS
person come out and talk to the students.  Please let me know.

FYI - Attached is a quote from a recent TWC memo that should be of interest 
given our recent conversations....

Charlie

"December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity."

This is a section from an internal TWC memorandum - it looks like Q4 might 
make up for the quiet tropical season as far as their profits are concerned...

WEATHER CHANNEL EARNS HIGHEST RATINGS FOR ANY DECEMBER IN ITS HISTORY
Coverage of last month's "Winter Blitz"  brought The Weather Channel the
highest ratings for any December in its 18-year history and shattered
weather.com's previous December page view records. December 2000 was the
third highest-rated month ever. The Blizzard of '96 gave TWC its highest
ratings, followed by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999.
 Among the many recording-breaking weather events reported by TWC last month
were the snowiest weather ever in at least 12 cities and the coldest weather
on record in many places, including Louisville, Ky.
December's winter weather events, coupled with early wintry weather in
October and November, boosted the network to an all-time high 4th quarter
rating, despite comparatively lower averages early in the quarter due to
quieter than usual hurricane activity.
TWC's coverage of the year-end Nor'easter that blanketed New York City with
over a foot of snow achieved a 0.870 rating, delivering 679,000 households
across the country on Saturday, December 30 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.).  The top
quarter hour occurred at 10 a.m. with a rating of 2.279 reaching 1.8 million
households.  The weekend rating for Dec. 30-31 was 0.753,  representing over
a half million households tuned in at any given time, according to Nielsen
data.  This was the second highest-rated weekend in 2000 and the sixth
highest-rated weekend in TWC's history.
Consumers also turned to weather.com in record numbers. By the close of
December, weather.com delivered more than 429 million total page views,
which is 67 percent higher than the previous monthly record, and 232 percent
higher than December 1999.  At its peak, weather.com delivered a record 27.8
million page views in a single day.  More than 1.3 million Unique Visitors
frequented weather.com  per day during the two weeks prior to Christmas,
according to Media Metrix.
The average TWC rating (6 a.m.-6 a.m.) from Dec.16-31 was 0.598, delivering
an average of 464,000 households, according to Nielsen. This was 85 percent
higher than the average rating for the same two-week period the year before.
The Weather Channel's coverage of sustained winter activity, which included
a Chicago blizzard on Dec. 10-11, brought the network its highest-rated
December ever.  TWC achieved a December rating of 0.462 (6 a.m.-6 a.m.),
delivering an average of 360,000 households.

Remi,

Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high 
quality job in your PRC representative role.  Per your request, I am 
attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last 
few months. 

I am currently in my first rotation as an Associate which I  began this past 
summer following graduation from UT with an MBA in Energy Finance.   I am 
assigned to Vince Kaminski's Research Group on the Market Fundamentals Team.  
This team is commonly referred to as the "Weather Group" and is headed by my 
supervisor, Mike Roberts.  We are located on the gas trading floor (32nd) and 
provide direct support to all the gas desks as well as weather derivatives 
trading.

Thanks again for your interest and I am looking forward to meeting you.   
Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

Charlie Weldon

Remi Collonges@ENRON

Dear all,

I believe that I will be your global PRC Representative on the 12th/13th of 
December.  For those who don't know me, I'm currently VP Trading & Risk 
Management in our S?o Paulo office, dealing with power and gas.  I'm very 
glad to be one of the reps in PRC, despite the work involved, because I truly 
believe that the best assets of our company are its employees.  I want to do 
my best to represent you fairly and actively.

In order to facilitate my task, I would really appreciate that all of you 
forward to me, by email:

1. a list of your accomplishments in year 2000 (should be not more than 10 to 
12 bullet points, telegraphic style)
2. a decently recent resume, that shows your school, previous work experience 
and start date at Enron.
3. a list of all of your rotations at Enron since hired.

4. In addition, I commit to call your supervisor as listed in PEP system to 
discuss your performance

5. I would also like to meet all of you before PRC meetings: I believe that 
you are either based in South America or in Houston (if that was not the 
case, please let me know by email, we'll speak on the phone).  For those 
based in S?o Paulo, call me and visit at our mutual convenience during the 
week of 4 to 8 December.  For those based in Houston, please call Samira (her 
phone is (55) 11 5503 1200) and schedule a half-hour meeting with me on 
Monday December 11, if you are in town.  I will be in Houston and should stay 
in 3AC1439 (or not far from there).  If you are based in Houston but out of 
town the 11th, let me know in advance, I'll speak to you on the phone.

I hope we'll run this process smoothly.  I look forward to meeting all of you,

Remi

Why don't you buy deep in the money put options?  They will have a high delta 
and hence move almost dollar for dollar with the stock.

Check out NOK Feb 55 puts, NZYMK.X  They are up 4-5/8 while NOK is down  
4-5/8.  2932 contracts out wth 24 traded today so liquidity shouild be OK.

Buy 400 ERICY for ~$4000 and one NOK put contract of NZYMK.x.  That should 
give you a delta on NOK equiv to shorting $4000 of the stock.

Did I figure this right?

sounds somewhat believable.  I can imagine the frenzy on the discussion 
boards if that got out.  I won't be the one to put it out there.

i think one more year and then its done.  Would the motivation for the Aggie 
AD to work really be only money?

Sunbeam (generator division) is also very pro-hurricane

   

Folks,

This note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress 
toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line 
of products.  

It is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane 
warning frequency and/or duration.  It is our objective to develop derivative 
products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this 
exposure.   We have generated a partial brainstorm-style list of whom natural 
counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure:

Pro-Hurricane     Anti-Hurricane
The Weather Channel    Resorts
Home Depot     Cruise Ships    
Lowes      Riverboat Casinos
CNN      Chemical Plants and Refineries
Local TV Stations    U.S Armed Forces
Dry Ice Manufacturers    Athletic Teams
Chainsaw Manufacturers   City Governments
Insect Repellant Manufacturers   State Governments

It is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is 
important to note that the pro-hurricane entities are more macro in nature 
while the anti-hurricane entities are typically more regional.  Thus, we have 
documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the 
thought that the anti-hurricane entities would be interested in regional 
products and the pro-hurricane entities would likely be more interested in 
bundled regional products depending on their exposure.

Thus far, we have collected and documented all U.S hurricane warning data 
from 1980-2000 in the form of an Excel database.  The data can be sorted by 
year, storm, or location on the U.S coastline.  Total hurricane warning 
duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary 
data sets of interest for any given location (or year or storm).  The U.S 
coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly 
similar size.  These regions are: New England, Mid-Atlantic, Virginia, North 
Carolina, Georgia/South Carolina, East Florida, West Florida, Florida 
Panhandle, Orleans/Miss/Bama, Lousiana, and Texas.

While this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes, it 
has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration 
is quite volatile and unpredictable.   It is believed that this volaility, 
when graphically depicted and mathematically represented, could be used to 
effectively demonstrate to would-be customers the impact of hurricane warning 
frequency on their business financials.  In many cases, businesses may be 
well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly 
probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves.

As we move forward on the modeling front, the data will certainly need to be 
scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends, 
satellite availability, population trends, etc.   Additionally, we need to go 
further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn't decline.

On the marketing front, I am certainly open to ideas.  It is believed the 
Weather Channel would be the most natural party for such a product.  Given 
our positive relationship that we currently have with them, they might be the 
easiest sell.     Any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when 
we should approach customers.

Please respond with any questions, comments or concerns on this project.

Thanks,

Charlie

Yep.  We won't  miss him as much as we will Fergie if he goes though.  I 
think if he's fully committed to being as good a pro as possible he could be 
really good.  We'll see.

WE'll likely move Joe Weber to FB.  He's ~225 lbs and pretty fast for a FB so 
he'll do.  Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named 
Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on 
the scout team.  I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that 
good.  He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last 
few years of recruiting.

ENE up 1-3/4!  Option bid only up 3 teenies from where I bought it though.  
the spread on options is about a 1/4 which makes it tough. 

Rebecca,

I was looking in EHROnline at my available vacation to verify that it all got 
accounted for correctly in 2000.  It appears that it did except for the fact 
that when I attempted to view my available vacation for 2001, it only 
indicates that I have 120 hours available.  I should have an additional 16 
hours left due to the 10 hours that accrued on 12/31/00 and the 6 I had left 
over.  Can you please let me know how to reconcile this in the system?

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Shares of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - Quotes, News, Boards) were smacked around 
again yesterday, following close on the heels of seven-session decline that 
sent the stock down more than 13 points, or 16%, from its recent high of 
$84.63 (December 28), all amid uncertainty and considerable volatility. 
The pullback doesn't appear to be company-specific exactly, although the 
rumblings in a certain geographic region, namely California, are triggering 
aftershocks
 throughout the U.S. energy community. 

As we outlined in a report on January 4, the energy situation in California 
has rapidly reached crisis proportions. Strict environmental legislation and 
the uncertain 
profit potential post-deregulation has kept utilities from installing 
sufficient generating capacity in the state over the last 10 years. 

The state's two major utilities, PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG - Quotes, News, 
Boards) and Edison International (NYSE: EIX - Quotes, News, Boards) , are 
facing the
 prospect of eventual insolvency due to the spiraling costs of electricity 
purchased on the open market. However, the rates the utilities can charge 
their customers
 for power represent a fraction of the costs that prevailed during the 
gradual rollout of full-scale deregulation. 

The risks to Enron are two-fold. 

For one, the crisis in California may result in a default of payments to the 
state's major wholesale energy providers, including Enron. Although the 
company does
 operate in California, the bottom-line impact would likely be shielded to a 
considerable degree because of Enron's size, strength, and diversified global 
revenue
 streams. In addition, Enron would likely be high on the list of default 
payees given its importance to future wholesale energy supplies in the 
region. 

More significantly, investors are concerned that California legislators may 
pull the plug on deregulation entirely, or at least until the current crisis 
abates. Some also
 fear this mess might derail utility deregulation in other states as 
regulators and politicians alike become fearful of adverse and unintended 
economic consequences. 

Neither scenario is probable. For one thing, the airline industry was 
deregulated in fits and starts, with plenty of mistakes and recrimination 
along the way. And a 
strong argument can be made that the shortage of electric power would have 
pressured rates sharply higher even in a fully regulated environment. 

The California Public Utility Commission will attempt to decide the best 
course of action this week. It appears inevitable that, regardless of PG&E 
and Edison's
 ultimate fate, the state's energy consumers will likely absorb much of the 
burden through an increase in the prevailing rate cap. 

Enron has also fallen victim to the rotation out of strong defensive stocks 
on the heels of the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest-rate cuts last 
week. The initial
 euphoria has waned, however, upon the realization that the sharp rate cuts 
will serve to offset what appears to be a rapid rate of erosion in domestic 
economic
 growth, rather than generating a rebound in economic activity. As a result, 
we expect investors once again to seek the shelter of well-capitalized 
defensive plays
 like Enron. 

We would emphasize that several factors that weigh in Enron's favor have been 
overlooked amid the California crisis. The November-December period was
 18% colder than normal and the second-coldest start to the winter months in 
the past 50 years. Coupled with an uncertain supply situation, particularly 
in natural 
gas, Enron stands to profit handsomely from energy volatility and pricing, an 
environment that is likely to exist for at least the next 12 months. 

In addition, Enron's diversification into still more new avenues of growth 
help to insulate the company from additional challenges of this sort in the 
future. The 
markets for EnronOnline, a real-time commodities exchange vehicle, and 
Enron's broadband services unit are expected to at least triple over the next 
year.
An eventual inflection point in the groups' profitability would serve to send 
profits measurably higher in the long term. 

Despite the recent turmoil, Enron's consensus earnings estimate for 2001, 
according to First Call, has come down a mere penny, to $1.65 a share. 
Although the 
stock's rich price/earnings multiple of 43 times may aggravate its near-term 
volatility, the absence of a complete collapse of the stock indicates the 
market 
approves of Enron's maneuvers so far and is confident in its prospects going 
forward
 

I will be unable to attend.

Thank You,

Charlie Weldon

I don't disagree with your view, but I wouldn't count broadband out yet.  It 
may be going slower than we like but it might come around eventually.  If it 
doesn't then there certainly will be hell to pay in the stock rice.

By the way,  I doubled up on JPM today.  It's showed me a profit you

Over the past 90 days, fund companies have either launched or filed paperwork 
with regulators for the first four mutual funds focusing on the 
new-power/alternative energy industries. Unlike broader energy funds, this 
pack will focus to varying degrees on a thinner band of the energy/utilities 
sector, namely companies that either sell power at steep prices to utilities 
unable to keep up with their customer's demand and those developing new ways 
to keep the lights on or maybe even run your car.

Theta is hurting me but gamma will hopefully come to my rescue.

Waht do you think about these funds buying ENE and its effect on price?

ENE at 70-9/16!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A good time, indeed!  Looking forward to another group trip sometime in the 
near future.

I do not have the resources (time or money) to become heavily involved but I 
would be interested in possibly helping out on Congressional elections for 
2002 as well as any other opportunities that may arise in town to "hob-knob" 
or otherwise contribute.

I'll consider what the most efficient way is for you to further your 
knowledge of business, etc.

We should be getting the pictures developed in the next day or two.  I'm 
looking forward to the digital ones you've got so I can forward them around.  
I added my sisters to the GOPUSA distribution list and may add some others 
later tonight.

When is the website going to have our pictures?

Hey V,

I had a great time this weekend!  This was a very momentous occassion,
and I'm glad we were able to share it with you and Melissa.

Please let me know what I should read to get more up to speed on the

As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. 

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.

Thanks,

Charlie

Mike,

The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.

Thanks,

Charlie

Can you tell me what the lowest reasonable ash content readily available is?  We will submit the lowest reasonably attainable spec to MHI and ask them to assure that they will meet the PM10 requirements.

Thanks!

Mike

Matt,

Doug Leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for Ft. Pierce.  I believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow.   

In order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved, I am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning.  Please let me know what your availability is.

Thanks!

Charlie

got it

Go it

Matt,

Two quick questions that Doug Leach needs answered ASAP to get the oil ordered:

1)  Name and number of contact person for handling the accounting/paperwork type issues at HD King plant.

2)  Name and number of contact person for logistic/scheduling issues at HD King plant.

Thanks,

Charlie

Got it

Thanks Mike.  Would you mind providing the MW and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes.

Thanks,

Charlie

Charlie,

The new plant max consumption for planning purposes should be set at 2,490 mmBtu/hr HHV.  In addition to this it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require 335 mmBtur/hr HHV, or a total of 2,825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

The plant consumption is based on the maximum combustion turbine requirement, plus a 5% margin, plus duct burning requirement.  This should be adequate as a conservative maximum case.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

Doug,

The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)

Thanks,

Charlie 

 

Just want to remind everyone that the exact quantity is 202,000 gallons, isn't that right David?

I spoke with David regarding this email.  He will call Ed and clarify how we are doing this deal.  Thanks for your assistance -- do you need anything else?

I spoke to Ed and Steve Treece at the plant this morning. Please confirm that Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record and whom do we send the invoices to. Both Ed and Steve were confused regarding this issue. I also need in writing asap (email ok) from someone within the project deal team that Enron will guarantee the fuel payment on behalf of FPUA. You need to be aware that the plant only has one truck unloading bay. That is fine with a 200,000 gallon tank fill with no rush, but will be unacceptable when you need the 800,000 gallons tank fill or are burning diesel as a primary fuel. What plans are in the works to build another truck unloading bay? When will that bay be operational?

Steve,

As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.  The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is  ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Charlie

Charlie & Steve,

I work in the power structuring group and need your assistance in pricing a gas swap.  The details are as follows:
	Jan 1, 2002 - Dec 31, 2012
	transco z6
	priced at mid
	
I'm sure I am missing some inputs since I am new to this.  Please tell me what else I need to provide you.  Could you please give me one price with basis included and one without basis.

Thanks,

Steve

Thank you Doug!  Sorry this thing turned into such a mess along the way.  I appreciate the help you have given both me and the team.

Charlie

I purchased 202,000 gallons of low sulfur diesel fuel from Central Oil Company (sub of Martin Gas) to be delivered to the Fort Pierce power plant starting on May 29 through June 5. A typical truck delivery is 7500 gallons so there will be about 27 truck deliveries. Deliveries will be made between 7:00am and 5:00pm during week days only. The fuel is priced at $0.9800/gallon delivered to the plant plus any applicable local, state and federal taxes. The fuel will be undyed. The current buyer of record to be shown on the bill of lading truck ticket will be Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority unless told otherwise prior to the first delivery. The truck scheduler at Central Oil is Tim Dick (813/448-2105) and he will coordinate with Steve Treece at Ft. Pierce. I have communicated all of the information above to Steve. Upon completion of the tank fill I recommend FPUA take a fuel sample and test for all appropriate diesel fuel quality specifications. 

David,

Attached is a summary calculation of the net payment owed FPUA for the fuel oil transaction.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Charlie 

 

Todd,
 
Attached is my resume per our conversation.

Okay Mr. Weldon,

I searched all my data and could not find where you might have given me monthly PG&E city gate prices.  At your convenience could you send these along to me along with monthly Nymex going back a couple of years.  I looked at what you had sent Kim and it looks like a PG&E WACOG calculation.

Thanks.

Phil

FYI...... (and I'll provide the update he is requesting)

Charlie,

Here is an update on Stagecoach:  Tennessee Gas Pipeline had to re-file their case with the FERC, which will unfortunately delay the deal and push it out of Q2 and into Q3 or Q4.  We were told to update the model (and all pricing) so we know where we stand on our valuation at this point.  Can you please update the gas price for us when you have a chance?  The load factors and the associated volumes are unchanged from the last information that we sent to you. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.  

Thanks,

John

Slight problem,  can't get the room in 3 Allen center b/c they turn down the A/C on the weekend and need a cost code to cover any desired cooling.  Hence, we will likely end up in the Enron building in a less nice room but we'll manage.

Steve Findley and Richard Powell are good for June 30.

Can you please put together a bio?  I want to have a board of directors

June settled at 3.738.   No pressure to pay but wanted to document.  Later....

Very cool.  Done

I'll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny.  

Chris,

Attached are the prices you requested.  Please let me know if I can help you in any way, as we discussed.

Thanks,

Cool.  I'll set up a payment plan if you wish, with competitive rates.  :-)

Charlie,  thanks for making the market.  Its obvious I've got no business trading right now.  

In my current group I go for days without looking at the market.  Not a good recipe for profits!  I'll bring the P/L tomorrow.

Do you have anything for us?

Eric,

We are doing our first preliminary look at a VPP with Abraxas.  Please provide me with very notional gas basis numbers for the below  points.  I will have more to add, but it will be next week.  If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

Rain is good.

I think Travis is coming to our house for a few days also.

Enron stock is a long story but we'll just all have to be patient.

I've been swamped.

Call you when I'm on the bus

We had about an inch of rain.  The water was just  beginning to run out at the ranch when I left but I think that it stopped  raining before it really got started.  I was rotorcycling in the front and  was going to keep on until the lighting started hitting all around  me. 
 
Talked to Travis this morning and he will be coming here  around the 18th of June the way it looks now.
 
What is wrong with Enron Stock?  Wish I had some money to  spend on it when it gets to 48.
 
Levis birthday party is today and I'm going to go get him some  boots in a minute.  He really wants to go ride the horse but I don't thing  that we will do that.
 
Thats All.   Dad           

Greetings to All,

Here's a quick update on the GOPUSA.com Board Meeting.  As it stands
right now, the board meeting will be held on Saturday, June 30 in
Houston.  The tentative time is from 10am - 3pm.  The meeting will be at
the law offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP (the GOPUSA.com, Inc. corporate
attorneys).  The address is 1000 Louisiana Street, 43rd Floor, Houston,
TX.

I'll plan some activities for us to do following the meeting as well.

Stay tuned for more details,

Bobby

Let's shoot for lunch next Tuesday.  Would one of you please contact me that a.m. to see how the day is going.  It's been pretty hectic lately but I think we will be able to do it.

Thanks,

Charlie 

Charlie,
	I spoke with Vance Holtzman yesterday about the 3 of us getting together for lunch.  However, Friday does not work because we are meeting up with a large group of interns for lunch on Friday.

FYI

Jennifer, attached is a summary model of the Ft. Pierce evaluation using Enron's curves.  Please note that there are two scenarios provided, based on a best case and worst case pipeline demand charge scenario.  The spread option model was dispatched based on the same assumptions as utilized by the gas group in developing their pipeline cost assumptions.  I've tried to add notes to the models outlining potential areas of additional value as there are some unique characteristics of this deal that should provide additional value to the project.  I'll be over to help review the cash flow model.  

Thanks for everyone's help (Edith/Charlie)

Greetings Editors and Board Members,

Just wanted to pass along a few items and wish you a good weekend.

First, for state editors... remember that you do not need to send me an
e-mail this weekend or any future weekend with you Monday morning
headline.  If I get an e-mail from your updater page on either Saturday
or Sunday, I'll then check your section on Sunday evening and use your
first headline for the State News Briefs section of the Eagle.  If you
want me to use a headline other than the first one, please send me an
e-mail.  Again, I'll include a headline if it is done on Saturday or
(even better) Sunday.  I won't use a Friday headline because I'd like
the news to be fresh.

Board members... please work on bios and pictures.  I'd like two
versions of the bio.  One is a one paragraph version which will be
contained on a web page of all directors, and the second is the full
bio.  I hate to say this, but there is really no rush on this. :)  I'd
just like to get it done.  Immediately following the board meeting at
the end of the month, the Eagle will run a store announcing the board of
directors and corporate officers, so that's the real deadline.

Finally... for all on this e-mail... on Monday, we will begin running
our first ad.  It is for CNSNews.com.  PLEASE CLICK ON IT.  They and
GOPUSA.com will be monitoring click-throughs, and I want to make sure we
deliver good results.  A few clicks per day would be cool.  They will be
running the ad for the entire month of June.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby

Here are the basis numbers only.  Sorry this took so long.

https://hrglobal.enron.com/

Team,

We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".

In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".

The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search

Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.

A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.

Thanks,

Charlie

I'll click the ad from home.  Your newsletter is massively jumbled on my Outlook here at work.  not sure why.

Congrats on the IFR rating.

Hey Dude,

Well, remember June 4, 2001 as the day we ran our first ad.  Also, don't
forget to click on the darn thing. :)

I'm still waiting on Bill to finish up the taxes.  These endless delays
are getting really old.

Glad to hear Buddy is getting better.  I assume we still need rain but are doing OK given the good rain 2 weeks ago.

I saw that AND read it

I was browsing through TXN news and saw the linked article.  I haven't
thought about a 4-10 mA signal in a very long time.  You were the only
person I could share this walk down memory lane with.

I should be able to help on that.  I'll try to call you later or call me at home this evening.

Hi Guys,

I've got a question about shares.  This past weekend, Kathleen and I
began setting up the QuickBooks files for GOPUSA.com.  We've got the
checking set up, as well as accounts receivable and accounts payable.

It's going to take a lot of work to document all the 2001 activities
because of lack of records, but at least from June 1, we will be totally
on the ball.

How do we record shares as far as the balance sheet is concerned?
Recall, that currently, GOPUSA.com, Inc. holds 60,000 shares as treasury
stock.  I hold 32,000, and Bill holds 8,000.  However, yesterday, I sold
1,000 shares to Kathleen's parents at $2/share.  Thus, the company will
now hold 59,000 shares, but $2,000 will be coming in.  How do we account
for this?

Take care,

Bobby

Thanks V!

I have an "interview" this pm with the 2 Texas Desk VP's.  IT's supposed to be informal.  If I go there I will not be on the "trading track" but will be a trader.  Sounds like a good deal to me.  We'll see what they say.
Who's your -uckin' daddy?  Congrats!!!!

I'm in the program but not sure yet if I will have to rotate or can go straight to the texas desk.  Lavorato and the Texas desk head are discussing it.  At least they know who I am.

I thought you'd find this interesting.

Hi Paul,

I had an hour-long conversation yesterday with a guy from Tyler named
Jorge Uresti.  He proposed a very interesting idea, and I'd love to get
your feedback on it.

Jorge has worked on in media, advertising, etc. for political campaigns
since 1994.  He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs,
billboards) for various levels of campaigns.  I think he sees the vast
marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and
he wants to be involved.  He threw out the idea of creating a section of
GOPUSA called GOPUSA MediaWorks.  This division would be under the
GOPUSA umbrella and handle all media operations for conservative
business, candidates, and elected officials.  The scope would be web
design, media, advertising, and on and on.

I'm very excited about this because it taps into the whole top-level
vision I have for the company which is to help get the conservative
message out.  Whether we are doing it ourselves (through our news,
information, and commentary) or providing the tools for others to do it,
we can become THE source for conservative activists to get or deliver
their message.

So, assuming this is a good idea (and if it's totally lame, please tell
me), what would be the best way of structuring it?  Simple
sub-contracting?  Creating a separate division?  My instincts tell me
that subcontracting would be easiest right now.  Plus, if the
relationship turned out to be unworkable, then we simply stop doing
business with them.

How would be go about pricing all of this?  What type of percentage
would be fair?  Obviously, we are talking about work that the current
GOPUSA is unable to perform because I don't have the time (for web
design stuff) or the experience (in the media stuff).  On the flip side,
there is no doubt that we could deliver clients these guys that they
would have never landed on their own.  If some folks in their region
might not know them, but they might be familiar with GOPUSA.

Anyway, I'm just passing along some thoughts.  Perhaps Chris might have
some comments as well.

Take care,

Bobby

Dear Intern Buddy - 

Thank you for volunteering to assist the Analyst/Associate Program with candidate cultivation this summer.   Summer internships are very important to the overall success of our program and we need your help to insure that our interns have enjoyable and meaningful experiences this summer. 

We have assigned you to be Michael Finger's summer buddy.   

To kick off the summer, the A/A Program will be hosting a "Meet the Pool" party on Thursday June 7th at the Hyatt Regency from 5:00PM to 9:00 PM.

We would like for you to use this opportunity to meet your summer buddy and to introduce them to others in the pool.  Please make contact with your buddy as soon as possible to make plans to attend the party together. 

In addition to attending this party together, we would like for you to spend a little time each week with your buddy.    We will send out an email next week with some suggested things for you and your buddy to do together.  Whether it is lunch or a simple phone call, your continued interaction with these interns could make a difference in the intern's decision to join Enron fulltime.  Suggestions from you are always welcomed!

As we progress through the summer, please make an attempt to gain insight into your buddy's internship.  Any feedback from them regarding their summer experiences will be welcomed, positive or negative.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at x35275.

Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely, 

Ted Bland

Charles,

Further to our conversation of this morning, I am enclosing my resume. I have spoken to Ed in the past therefore he knows my interest in the structuring group . I would appreciate it very much if you can pass it to the right people so that I can get a interview slot for next week.

Thanks for your help

Regards
Naveed

Thanks Doug,  Can you confirm (or tell me how I can)  that these sample charge are being routed to Co#0413, RC#106230 per my previous note.

   

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

I'd still like to play tennis sometime.  I don't have the time nor the money to play much golf.

Speaking of golf and your predictions, would you like to wager on your goal of 70's by Dec '02.  I'll bet you right now at $10 a stroke over/under 80 on a reasonable course (par 72 etc)  of your choice in Houston next December.   :-)

Charlie
 (future Dynegy employee, hopefully)

Hi Charlie,

I got your message yesterday.  I'm very sorry to hear about your
grandfather.

Sure, I'd be glad to play tennis sometime.  However, I'd rather practice
golf.  With all the computer work I've been doing, I really started to
miss doing something competitive.  So, rather than tennis, I'm focusing
on a new challenge, and I decided to get good at golf.

I know you'll laugh at all this, but I'm approaching it the same way I
did tennis and baseball.  I'm watching and practicing.  I've been
working at it for about a month.  Unlike a couple of years ago when I
would just go out and play, I'm focusing on learning the stroke and
getting good.  In the past month, I've gone from high 90s to high 80s.
When I consistently get in the mid 80s, I'll get a good set of clubs and
then keep going.  My goal (which I'll reach) is to shoot in the 70s by
December 2002.  If you care to bet, I'll gladly take you up on it. :)

It's so cool, because in the last week, it finally clicked on how the
wrist snap is similar to tennis, and that made all the difference in the
world.  Now, I can practice a good swing instead of a swing that
happened to yield decent results from time to time.

Anyway, it's great to get outside and focus on something competitive
again.  We have some relatives coming in this weekend, so it looks like
we'll be heading up your way on Saturday.  I'm actually going to be
flying to Victoria and back with my brother-in-law's uncle just for fun
on Saturday afternoon.  I think you said that you won't be in town, but
if you are, let me know.

See ya,

Bobby

Kim,

The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.

Let me know if you need any more assistance.

Thanks,

Cash P&L is now saved in Charlie directory on that path you gave me..

Charlie,

Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's.

Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. 

So, we are pretty close on the p&l. I just need to verify your starting positions to confirm/reconcile our true-ups.

HEADLINE: Back  to borders: The attacks of September 11 will increase the

costs of production  and international trade. As a result, the world may

start to turn its back on  globalisation, says Stephen Roach: 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ROACH  

BODY: 

The footprints of globalisation have left an obvious and  important mark on

the economic landscape during the past decade. But the  terrorist attacks of

September 11 and their aftermath may bring about its  demise. 

In the economic and financial sphere, globalisation is all about  enhanced

cross-border connectivity. Rapidly expanding trade and capital  flows,

increasingly globalised supply chains, and the rapid expansion  of

transnational activity of multinational corporations has made the world  

smaller place. New information technologies have become the glue  of

globalisation, making cross-border connectivity faster, cheaper  and

increasingly frictionless. 

Evidence of globalisation is  unmistakable. According to Morgan Stanley,

global trade rose to a record 26  per cent of world gross domestic product in

2000 - up from 18 per cent in  1990. Transfers between foreign affiliates of

multinationals surged by nearly  twice as much as global trade did over the

past decade. Trade zones such as  Nafta created new linkages between the

industrial world and its offshore  suppliers: exports to the US account for

25 per cent of Mexican GDP, for  example. Asia, excluding Japan, has also

become tightly linked to the US IT  demand cycle; close to 40 per cent of the

region's overall economic growth in  2000 can be accounted for by surging IT

exports to the US. In many ways, the  world was coming together as never

before. 

But the rules of the game  have changed. Terrorism puts sand in the gears of

cross-border connectivity  and the result threatens the increasingly

frictionless world of  globalisation. The tragic events of September 11 have,

in effect, levied a  new tax on such flows. The security of national borders

will now have to be  tightened - hardly a costless endeavour. That will

affect more than airports  and shipping ports. The porous borders of Canada

and Mexico, the conduits of  increasingly seamless Nafta linkages, will be

tightened too. 

As a  result, cross-border transfers will now cost more and take longer,  and

insurance rates on such shipments will become considerably more  expensive.

Moreover, as the recent outbreak of the Nimda computer virus  indicates, it

will no longer be possible to take instantaneous transfer of  information and

financial capital for granted. Terrorist attacks also instil  fear, raising

the risk premia of global connectivity. Suddenly, the brave new  world looks

a lot less seamless. 

Basic economics says that a tax on  cross-border connections should reduce

the flow of such transactions. In  choosing offshore outsourcing versus

domestic production, the calculus of  relative cost advantages may have been

permanently changed. 

But there  is also a psychological dimension: companies could start to look

inwards. The  appetite for forging new cross-border alliances may diminish in

an  increasingly unstable world. Risk aversion may take on  ever-greater

importance. 

There is another important dimension to this  tax on globalisation. It

reflects the impact of a potential shift of national  output away from

productivity-enhancing investments. Productivity enhancement  and

globalisation have always gone hand in hand. The surge of  offshore

outsourcing has been critical to newfound business efficiencies.  

A tax on globalisation could change all of that. It is not only  the

increments to business costs that might now arise from higher  security,

shipping and insurance expenses. It is also the potential  ramifications of a

shift in government spending back towards national  defence, reversing one of

the more important trends of the post-cold war era.  This peace dividend

reduced defence spending as a proportion of US GDP from  more than 7 per cent

to less than 4 per cent during the past 15 years. At the  margin, reversal of

this downtrend could crowd out private sector investment.  

Productivity growth was set to decline over the next five years as  the

excesses were taken out of an IT-induced capital-spending expansion.  The

costs of fighting global terrorism may take an additional toll. A  slowdown

of trend productivity growth would then put concomitant pressure  on

corporate earning power and, by inference, on expected equity  returns.

Investors could be in for a particularly rude awakening. 

New  alliances among governments are likely, juxtaposed against the  private

sector's potentially diminished appetite for globalisation. The  world's

leading powers now seem to be coming together in an extraordinary  fashion in

the aftermath of the attacks. United in the goal of combating  global

terrorism, other grievances, such as trade disputes, are being put  aside -

at least for the moment. 

But these new alliances may backfire  in one important respect. They may

drive an even greater wedge between the  developed and the developing world.

Such a geopolitical wedge could reinforce  long-simmering economic

differences and increasingly isolate the developing  world. Widening income

inequalities between the rich and the poor nations was  an unmistakable

hallmark of the 20th century. According to research by the  International

Monetary Fund, the richest 25 per cent of the world's  population experienced

a six-fold increase in real GDP per capita during the  last century. By

contrast, the lower quartile of world population enjoyed  less than half that

gain. And these disparities are being exacerbated by the  "digital divide" of

the information age - the contrast in economic  opportunities between the

computer literate and those lacking such skills.  

These tensions do not speak well of the "global village" as an apt image  of

where globalisation is now headed. The economic benefits of  cross-border

connectivity have long stood in sharp contrast with social  disparities

between rich and poor nations. New political alliances that arise  from a

united front among rich nations against global terrorism may well  compound

this gap. 

Such growing fragmentation means that the world  may be turning its back on

globalisation. The recent cancellation of the  annual meetings of the IMF and

World Bank in Washington is particularly  disappointing in this regard. While

both institutions have come under attack  for mismanaging the process from

time to time - especially during the Asian  crisis of 1997-98 - these

meetings offer a forum to probe the strengths and  weakness of globalisation.

That opportunity will be sorely missed at this  critical juncture in history.

This would not be the first setback for  globalisation. The integration of

the Atlantic economy in the 19th century  held out the promise of powerful

convergence within Europe and between Europe  and the US. Yet this seemingly

unstoppable trend gave rise to an equally  powerful backlash, brought about

by the confluence of rising global income  inequalities and political

instability that played a role in sparking the  first world war. 

Yet another wave of globalisation occurred during the  1920s, only to be

brought to an abrupt end by the Great Depression and a  renewed outbreak of

war. The preconditions of these earlier backlashes -  widening global income

disparities and mounting geopolitical tensions - seem  haunting today. Not

only does history tell us there is nothing inherently  stable about

globalisation, but it also highlights globalisation's tendency  to sow the

seeds of its own demise. Sadly, this time may be no different.  

There is always a chance that we are making too much out of the  implications

of September 11. But the global costs of escalating terrorism  are

unmistakable. A new tax on the price of cross-border linkages is a big  deal.

The same can be said of deepening political alliances in one  powerful

segment of the world. 

The forces of globalisation, which  once seemed unstoppable, are facing new

resistance. So too are the  productivity-led underpinnings of the US and

world economy. The playing field  may be tilting before our eyes.

This sample tested by Saybolt was from a shore tank of low sulfur diesel (Colonial 74 grade) in a major's tank in the Houston area. This is representative of the low sulfur diesel that would be shipped to Florida. Fax is on it's way. Any questions call me at x35007.

   

Doug,

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.

Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10)  Note the volatility in these that I graphed.  This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Doug,

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.

Thanks again,

Charlie

I'll sell you up to 2 Jun nat gas at 4.565 right now, same as Johnny.

Charlie:  We made a request to MHI last week and with this memo, I will follow up with Frank Hosak to make sure that it is on the items to be discussed this coming Wednesday.

Frank:  Would you please make sure that we have this item on the Agenda and tell them we are expecting an answer.

thanks, bill fox 

   

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

One G2 was 10.5.  Other was ~9.5.  G3's were 7.5 ish, maybe 8.  I thought it was a pretty good deer.  He would have been really good next year but we've let so many go like that not to ever see them again... , I'm really glad he got this one to break his 7 year drought.  This was his 8th season.

That is not a bad buck at all.  Do you know  what the lenth of the G2's and G3's are???  They look pretty  descent.

Hi Jay,

Please find the attached file. It has two more tabs for the two regressions, one replacing the holes in the data(reg-wo-hole) and one with manipulation in the holes of the data (Regression-w-hole). Both the regressions suggest similar results. The graph shows regression output. We might want to try only the winter data if that is what you are looking for. Or, we may also put the restriction on the regression that the gas consumption cannot go down beyond 5000 (to take care of negative estimates).

Let me know what you think and I would be happy to do the further analyses.

Thanks 

Could you please run regression analysis on some data in this worksheet.  The two data arrays are on the "Daily" tab in column C and on the "Temperature" tab in column F.

Thank you,

Guys,,

I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.

How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?

Thanks,

Charlie

Thanks for the info!

Is this guy short ENE or what?  He has a couple of decent points about our "fuzzy" math. but we won't miss earnings, guaranteed, for at least a couple quarters.

HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 

Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966	
Gross Heat of Combustion, BTU/Lbs	D-240 or D-4868	19,520	19,780	

Marc

   

Could you forward this info to Charlie? Copy me.

Doug,

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  

Thanks,

Charlie

Mike,

I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.  I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.  He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Yesterday I faxed a copy of Colonial Pipeline's specifications for fungible low sulfur diesel fuel (74 grade) to Mark Breese. That spec sheet is indicative of the specs for low sulfur diesel in Florida. It must be remembered that Florida has no refineries nor product pipelines and receives their fuel via barges and vessels from domestic and international refineries and terminals. Will forward Colonial jet fuel (54 grade) specs. 

   

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index
	cetane number

Thank you,

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Matt,

Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.

Thanks again for all your help.

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

Attached in Bold are the answers to all the questions except 6 and 8.  The major outstanding issue as of right now is the final determination of specs for the fuel oil from Mitsubishi..

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     3"
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001
10) Any other issue to be discussed

It was nice meeting you and I wish you good luck in the admissions process.

Sincerely,

Charlie

Great.

Flossie is a Maxine, not a Max

We are planning on bringing Flossie if that's OK.

Why are energy stocks down so much today?  My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price.

103!

We should make it by 6:45 plus or minus 30 minutes

Sounds like fun.

I got my offer from UBS Friday and turned it in today, signed.  The judge approved the deal Friday also so if nothing gets screwed up in the next few weeks then I should have a new employer (when the deal closes)

Have fun,

Charlie

Well it is finally decided, we are leaving for Billings, Montana Wednesday  be back Sunday.  Saw 1 by 0 the other day and another spike that needed  killing.  I ask the Game Biologist what procedure to take to get permission  to kill them.  He said to put the cross hairs on them and pull the trigger,  but first call the game warden and find out where he is.  Lot of  help.  Dad
  

I just deleted a bunch.  LEt me know if I need to do anymore.

Enron Avg = 90 injected
Industry avg = 86 injected
I-Bank Avg = ~72 injected (they should stick to banking)

My number is 88.

I think the market has already built in a 90 or less number.

Matt,

 Would you please make sure that David gets to see this tomorrow.  Mark asked me to send this so you could print it out and have Dave look at it and then recommend would else ought to see it.  Would you plese E-mail me or call me with a list of who else needs to see this sometime tomorrow, per Mark.

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:

	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0

Applicant Name: Suzette Emmons

Visit Location:  Houston
Visit Date:  4/30/01

Trait Description	Rating (1 through 4)	Comments                                                                                              	
                              	 	 	
Communication Skills    	         1	Very strong and effective communicator.	
Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.	
Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.	
Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	
Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	
Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	

Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. 

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.

Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

We'll be there Friday night and plan to spend the night.  If Elizabeth would rather spend the night with her friend, that's fine.  Hunter can play with Travis that night and be plenty happy.

Love,

Charlie

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:

	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	

NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

 

Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)

Thanks,

Charlie

Suzette,

Monday morning should work.  Just give me a call.  I'm tied up in the p.m. but a.m. should work.

Charlie - 

I am in an off site vendor meeting this morning and hope to be in the office later this afternoon.  Unfortunately, I am out of town on Friday (I am actually headed to Austin for a visit).  But could perhaps do something Monday morning, if I can't get to the office in time this afternoon.  Let me know your availability.  Thanks so much.

Hey Dude,

If you are interested in checking out the new message board, read the
e-mail below.

Bobby

Greetings,

The folks who are getting this e-mail include state editors, some folks
who have been following the web site closely, and recent posters to our
current message board.

I need your help testing out a new section of the GOPUSA.com web site,
and I hope you will participate.

In the past, GOPUSA.com has not made the proper effort that it should in
promoting its message board.  This is unfortunate, and it's about to
change.  If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has not
promoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over the
last several months.

Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completely
redesigning the message board!  The new message board is called the
GOPUSA.com Forum.  It uses much better software than we had before, and
it is much more versatile:

* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.  This
password will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.
The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/her
posts.
* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registered
user can leave a message for another registered user.
* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new news
and information.
* There are varying levels of "members" depending on how many posts a
user has made.
* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.
* There is a lot more as well...

So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.  My plan is to
launch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of the
Eagle.  So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.  Then,
late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and open
it up to you guys to start posting real messages.

Here's what I'd like you to do:

* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum at
http://gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl
* Register with the Forum
* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a different
password in your "profile"
* Make some posts to the existing topics.  These posts don't have to be
related to the topic.  We're simply testing at this point.  The post
can, however, contain your opinions about the board, etc.
* Please e-mail me if you can participate in the testing.
* Please e-mail me (and post to the board) your ideas on topics.  A
could place for comparison is http://www.freerepublic.com
* Consider the idea on having state specific categories (a California
section, etc.) or just general categories like I have now.  Please give
me your thoughts on this.
* Test out all the features you can on the board.  If you see graphics
that don't "fit" with the layout, please let me know.  I'm customizing
the graphics to fit the GOPUSA.com theme, but I haven't changed all of
them yet.
* Don't comment on the fact that the links aren't working on the general
GOPUSA.com page that contains the Forum.  This is just a template of the
new layout, and it will be working Monday.

Thank you so much for your help on this.  Time is of the essence, and I
apologize for the late start on this.  It was not the orignial plan.  We
are going to make a big effort to build a GOPUSA community, and I know
the Forum will play a large role.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby

We are going to talk with Shankman tomorrow and so was wondering if you could refresh the prices for the collars in the attached file.  Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.  Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.  (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).  Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.  These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.  Use tonights close if you don't mind.

Please let me know if you have any questions,  

Thanks again,

eric

Hey Charlie,

I responded to your cweldon@houston.rr.com <mailto:cweldon@houston.rr.com>
address yesterday and it came back undeliverable...not sure what is up but
anyway...

How's everything going with you and the family? How is Melissa feeling? Mom
said they had a great time visiting with everyone over Easter weekend. I am
sorry we could not be there. How was your Easter? We had probably the best
set of Holy Week services we have ever had.

How is work going? Are you still having to put in quite a few more hours
these days?

My job is going well. I am starting to settle a bit into my new position,
but am still working through some transition issues from my old position. I
think that I will like doing this new job quite a bit. I have good people to
work with. Our church band is really starting to come together...I am really
excited. We are hoping to have a concert on May 19th or June 2nd (depending
on a business trip I may or may not need to take). Mom and Dad are coming up
to see the concert. You all had talked about coming up sometime in the
spring...do you have any dates in mind?

Well, I've got to run...I have bonuses to calculate and a meeting to get
ready for. You all take care...give Melissa and Hunter a hug from all of us.

All our love...stayton

P.S. What is your take on TI these days? I am planning on getting some more
Enron stock soon and want to know if you are still high on TI...slpj

John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Charlie

 
  

Dear Charles-

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

We looked into this, and I have another call with them tomorrow.  So far it 
looks like they are long the balance of the year.

your volume comparison chart is off by a factor of 10.  each contract is 1000

i assumed it was intentional, but wanted to make sure.  for the moment it 
works, but if our volumes continue to rise, we need to move to absolute 
numbers

Joe,

I have slotted you 90 minutes w/Greg on Wednesday @ 4:00 p.m.  Greg is 
scheduled to participate in a Houston conference call @ 5:30 p.m.  You guys 
are connecting again for dinner.  Please let me know the time and location 
for dinner on Wednesday night.  Also, Greg says his schedule is open enough 
that he would like to hang out on the floor w/you and your guys.  He will be 
officing over by John Sherriff and the mobile number he's carrying is +44  
7901516638.

Many Thanks,

This has been reviewed by HR and Gene Humphrey.  Please respond with any 
comments.  It is intended to go out on Tuesday at noon.  I will have the 
reorg group meeting Tuesday morning.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i 
heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but 
it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the 
notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.

greg

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

Fun Fun Fun

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

by this ratio the rest ot the power group is really underperforming!!!!

This 250K came from about 3 MW.
We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

where are you right now?  i am in london.  are you around?

Greg:

I will be in Houston next Wed/Thu 13-14 Jun.  Any chance we could get 
together to discuss life, Enron, and associated concepts?  Let me know what 
times would suit.

Many thanks,

Stu

you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

I Shouldn't Kevin report into the OTC for wholesale as we discussed?  Mark 
This has been reviewed by HR and Gene Humphrey.  Please respond with any 
comments.  It is intended to go out on Tuesday at noon.  I will have the 
reorg group meeting Tuesday morning.

i have a question on my p&l.  how did the hedge book make money on change in 
price when it was long and the market went down?

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.  As 
I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to 
contact him next week.

They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch.  
Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen

Pls. join a meeting in Greg's office today at 4:15 p.m. today to discuss management's recommendation to the Board of Directors on Project Southwood.  Thanks.  Paula 

I'm not sure this memo doesn't get you even more noise.   Can't you just get around to your leaders and explain what you are doing?  The memo sounds too negative and could damage morale further.

Mark and Steve - Jackie spoke with Mark about the letter below that we would like to send out to Enron Europe and she indicated you had some concerns which is exactly why we want to be decussing this with you.  We have really tried to couch this letter in terms of  the annual budget process and had not intended on sending it out this soon.  But the noise level associated with our internal budget meetings (where we are asking virtually every group for some level of cuts)  is really growing.  I have discussed this with Mark Frevert and sent to Greg (but not heard back from Greg yet).  If we get concurrance then we hope to send out to our employees on Monday.  Your thoughts?

DRAFT MESSAGE

Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played a significant role in this success.  Although Enron's recurring earnings have increased quarter on quarter for the past five years - a 20% annual growth rate since 1997, along with other companies, Enron's stock price has fallen over the past year.  Of course the September 11th terrorist attacks have impacted the financial markets and many of our counterparties are quite involved in managing the insurance, security and other financial consequences of global financial tightening.  This makes it tougher to get new business solutions first and foremost on our customers' agendas.

Enron is still the leading buyer and seller of gas and power in Europe and we believe that we will be affected less than other companies, but we are not immune to tough economic conditions.  If we are to maintain past growth levels and rebuild our share value, we need to focus very closely on our cost base in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We will also be analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the "back burner"and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep our earnings growth on track.  Whenever possible we will seek opportunities to move employees from units that are tightening to those that are growing but we still expect a net drop in our headcount.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible so that everyone knows where they stand.

We know that this is a tough time for everyone at the moment.  We all have concerns about what is going on in the world and we are taking whatever steps that we reasonably can to keep our people safe.  We are making changes to ensure tighter building security and soon we will be telling you about  changes in our IT network designed to make it more secure from computer virus attacks.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you have and remember that you can also make use of the confidential counselling service that is available through HR Online via the Enron Europe intranet site.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these efficiencies, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe and that is the game that we are committed to - a fast growing, profitable and successful company.

John Sherriff & Michael Brown

ya think?     these guys wanted to pitch me on what they can do to track afgan weather.  i don't see how we could possibly make money with that!!

ouR GUYS ARE GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.
John,

Video is 3 minutes

Bottom line: No weather-related reasons that would preclude military operations next 72 hours (from 8am tomorrow forward)

Excellent weather (clear skies, clean frontal passage, good temperature differentials for IR target tracking as well as optics)

i know that power will open at 6:30.  will the gas markets be open then?  we figured that we might go with 7 so that both were open.

Lavo said 6:30am?  We will have 7:00am on the home page - let me know (or Jay Webb if it wants changing.)

First quote from Greg should read:  "We see no reason for gas and power markets to become unstable in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies" . . .

See draft release for first thing in the am.
 
Enron Appeals for Calm in US Natural Gas and Power Markets
 
      Enron appealed today for calm in US natural gas and power markets.  Enron will be available to buy and sell natural gas and power both over the phone and through its online platform Enrononline.
 
      "We see no reason for gas and power markets to panic in the aftermath of yesterday's tragedies," said Greg Whalley, President and Chief Operating Officer.  "These are domestic commodities and the physical infrastructure is secure and operating."
 
     Enrononline will be open for gas and power transactions from 7:00 am to 12:00 noon, CDT to enable market participants to make purchases and sales and adjust their positions as necessary.

Does this mean that Rice is leaving immediately.
 
John

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

I'm sorry I haven't been more involved is setting this up, but I think the agenda looks kond of soft.  At a minimum, I would like to turn the schedule around and hit the hard subjects like Q3, risk management, and asset sales first.  I would also like to see a discussion on our funds flow, cash flow, and our balance sheet.  If we don't get these things right, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Also, I notice that Cindy Olson and Beth Tilney are in attendance.  This should only be for presentation, as they are not members of the management committee.  It also seems a bit unusual to have Beth Tilney present for a discussion on company image and presentation, and not have Mark Palmer.
 
 
Please refer to the attached agenda for the offsite meeting scheduled Thursday, September 6 - Friday, September 7.  Since all discussions will be informal, PowerPoint presentations are not necessary.    Please let me know if you need a room for Wednesday evening.

reading todays comments, i guess i'm one of the not ready for prime time players !!  can't you make them say nice things about me?  i could get my feelings hurt here.  i must say that i'm glad to here that i am "very young". 

we were trying to get an extension on the oz deal.  did we get it?
we need to figure out what the schedule is on this deal and i would like to spend some more time on the pricing.  
 
i am going to have a problem with this claims trading meeting in the morning.  we may need to postpone.

=09=09=09=09

=09I have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to=
 better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards =
that a good review process should.  I hope you will consider my thoughts ca=
refully since I have had active involvement in the process from its incepti=
on and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered. =20

=09It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing =
to the employee being reviewed.  Even those that do well are suspicious of =
the process and don't particularly like it.  It causes a great deal of stre=
ss on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that=
 should be supportive of it.  There is a belief that the process is arbitra=
ry and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rathe=
r the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative succes=
s of any particular reviewer.  The biggest single complaint seems to be the=
 fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are ex=
cellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse.  =
While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of ti=
me, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance ha=
s declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not=
 as good as they were six months earlier.  We are mixing the message betwee=
n the worth of the individual and the results of their performance.  The fo=
llowing is my recommendation to improve on this system:

=09SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES  =20

=09
=091.  Employee Skill, Competency and Character  - This category measures a=
 persons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's va=
lues.  This determinant should not change drastically between each review p=
eriod since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change s=
lowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better=
 qualified employees.  In this category a person could be told whether they=
 are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunit=
y to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing =
that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires.  This parti=
cular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hirin=
g and training program.

=092.  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is per=
forming the tasks of any particular job.  This measure could fluctuate much=
 more than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over =
time based on many different circumstances.  This measure would also distin=
guish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or =
greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are=
 outstanding performers.  It should also help identify those who are under =
performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first ca=
tegory.  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of p=
eople since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform abov=
e and beyond their own capability.

=093.  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result =
of the effort of any individual employee.  I believe this criteria is most =
suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining fact=
or (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments.  This should be closely =
correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since s=
ome people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at som=
e future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by bein=
g in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it with=
out the appropriate effort.

=09In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descri=
ptions that are included in the PRC process.  I think it is a waste of time=
 to include clerks,  assistants, accounting personnel and other non manager=
 commercial support people in the process.  Very little is gained by them o=
r by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created. =
 I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and on=
ly focus on the first two performance categories at that time.  I would als=
o change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the s=
ummer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end wh=
en there is so much other business activity going on.  I think a March, Sep=
tember schedule would work much better.

=09There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am =
sure that you are working on them.  Please give my ideas some thought and s=
ee if they don't merit some consideration.  

got your message on cta.   it usually gets picked up in the analysis, but i guess tax usually does too.  this tax issue seemed to surprise everyone.  hopefully we can get a handle on the true impact of any sales soon.  \
by the way, i guess ken told someone today that we would make the numbers.  we need to be careful until we know what the numbers are.
 
are you around on wednesday?  we should talk about a few things.

are you putting together an analysis and recommendation on the new goodwill rules?  i would like to get together to talk about this next week.

go ahead with fallon's guaranteed bonus proposal

who sends out messages like these?  what is the current policy?  does this mean that deleted items are kept, or just saved ones?  30 days is a really long time!!!1

Please be advised that effective Monday, September  10, 2001, the retention policy for all voice mails will be 30 days. 

yes, this is the reason i was looking for him.  i will try to see him in london.  i also talked to sally and will follow up with another meeting.  jay webb seems to be okay.  
 
 

I just saw this e-mail and I assume this is why you were looking for Mark on our floor a few minutes ago.  He is in London this week.
 
Mark wanted to talk to Mr. Lay and I encouraged him to talk to you instead.  I assured Mark not to read too much in to the omission and that you told me you valued technology and operations, but I still think he is somewhat concerned.
 
Sally is still somewhat concerned as well but she and I had lunch and she is fine.
 
I assure you I have taken you at your word and I am moving on.

Greg/Mark,

Firstly, many congratulations on your promotions, you are the best guys for the job.

I spoke to Greg Piper yesterday about his conversation with you over the management committee and would like to add my comments. I would appreciate your feedback on this and would also ask that you pass it by Ken.

I saw the recent message about the formation of the new Enron management committee. With Jeff's recent departure I understand the need to quickly reassure the shareholders, analysts and employees that we have great strength in management depth.

Given this I was surprised that there was no representation of Enron Net Works on the committee. I'm sure you will have wanted to keep the group to a manageable size, but I think that you should have at least included our CEO, Greg Piper. Here's why:

1)      EnronOnline is probably the best eCommerce application in the World. Enron have publicly milked the praise for this flagship IT system, and it is now core to Enron's trading business globally. Undoubtedly this system will be driven by the business in a multitude of directions as we seek to use it to our advantage in the future. We therefore need to be where the decisions are made.

2)    EnronOnline is only one of many world class IT systems we have developed at Enron. It gets the headlines because it is externally facing, however, all of the other internally facing systems are driven by the business too. There are things we can do and things we can't. We need to be represented at the management committee to ensure that the many management decisions that rely on IT are made with clear understanding of the IT implications.

3)    Many progressive and innovative companies now view IT as the backbone of their organisation (I think we have said this a number of times in public) and ensure there is board level IT representation in the company. Analysts will look at Enron and ask why we are not the same, especially given EnronOnline.

4)    Enron Net Works will be spending about $750,000,000 of Enron's money in 2002.

5)    Two and a half thousand Enron Net Works employees will already have read the management memo and will be asking why Enron Net Works is the only Enron unit not represented at the top. They will be asking what this tells them about their management (Greg and I) and also be wondering if they are again to be second-class Enron citizens. In this post-Skilling period, we need to be motivating our employees, not putting more doubts into their minds.

6)    Whilst keeping the management committee to mainly the larger revenue generating units, I see that there is representation from Accounts, Legal, Controls. IT should be up there too.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope that it may make you reconsider having Greg Piper in the commitee.

 

Best regards

MRP

we're making some headway.  get me a copy of your contact list, and annotate those who have traded.  let's try and get a meeting next week.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

let me know when and i'll see if i can make it.  you should call greg piper too.

Greg--I spoke to Bo Collins and he is interested in getting together with Enron. He is travelling to Houston next week and will get back to me soon about his schedule for a meeting at our offices. 

jim hughes also knows him well and sent me a message about a dinner he is having with bo soon.  i told him to mention that we would be happy to discuss the interaction between eol and enymex.  if you talk to him soon, relay the same message.

Comments? 

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. 

i don't know what this is about, but i thought i'd send it to you

Greg,  I am a cofounder of Inknowvator Inc.  I live in Houston, actually
Gene Humphrey and several other Enron folks are my neighbors.
Our new Idea Manager solution was selected by  Xcelerator to identify,
develop and select new ventures.  This was put on hold following the recent
management change.    The Knowledge Management group, then housed in EES,
had also recommended that we be brought in as an internal solution and as
an Enron corporate offering.

We are an ideal solution for Enron to identify and develop new business
ventures, to enhance current products and services,  and to share ideas and
learnings across the company.  Our solution is perfect for helping you
manage current organizational changes by engaging all employees to
understand issues and share ideas through innovation.  We can be up and
running in less than a month.  This could also be a great innovative story
for Wall Street.

The solution is being utilized by leading global companies in various ways
including:
1.  Strategic planning and new venture portfolio management
2.  New business, product, and service development
3.  Corporate innovation programs

We have now implemented or have reached agreement  to implement our
solution at various clients including:
   Schlumberger
   Halliburton
   ExxonMobil
   Johnson & Johnson
   IBM

Idea Manager is a unique decision software solution designed to capture and
utilize ideas, information and expertise that were here-to-fore relatively
inaccessible or unusable.  The solution encompasses the identification and
development of business opportunities and decision making in a leading edge
collaborative environment using portfolio management best practices.

I will call to schedule some time. I can give you a high level overview in
30 minutes.

Regards,

Ron

Mr Scrimshaw,

Thank you for your email to Leslie who is currently away.  Attached is the
list of participants to date although there are still invitations
outstanding.  The meeting is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in
Knightsbridge.

Please let me know if there is any further information you require at this
stage.

Regards.

...another thought.  Could we surrender our current high priced options to help fund these or other plans?  I know there are many accounting requirements but we could atleast start the time clock on the next reload period.

if you want a jet allocation we need to talk about it.  as fare as these folks are concerned they get zero hours.  make thaat clear to avaition, or call liz and tell her to cancel their authorization.

On a serious note - it would appear that a fair number of folks get personal allocations for the corporate jet.  Do I get any allocation for personal aircraft usage above my current compensation level?

Regards,

At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.  Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768.  Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay).  While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either.  

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$79,485		10.78%
	EBS			$14,555		1.31%
	EEOS			$32,143		18.18%
	EEL			$6,104		14.29%
	EGM			$74,030		11.53%
	EIM			$62,567		21.62%
	ENW			$77,960		3.82%
	EWS Bus. Analysis	$25,024		12.84%
	EWS Bus. Dev.		$13,438		75.00%
	EWS HR		$6,985		8.33%
	EWS Legal		$38,800		20.65%
	EWS Research		$19,080		23.40%
	EWS Treasury		$13,661		71.43%
	EWS TOTAL		$488,832	7.85%

From a corporate perspective, EWS is tracking fairly closely to the others.  Here are the other groups' totals:

	ETS			$146,466	12.92%
	Corporate		$359,925	10.07%
	EES			$131,439	6.56%

jim hughes also knows him well and sent me a message about a dinner he is having with bo soon.  i told him to mention that we would be happy to discuss the interaction between eol and enymex.  if you talk to him soon, relay the same message.

Comments? 

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. 

not really.  just let him know that we would be happy to discuss how enrononline and enymex can interact.

Greg: 

The new President of the NYMEX, Bo Collins, is a friend of mine.  My wife and I are going to be spending this coming weekend with the Collins.  Does Enron have any outstanding issues or agendas with the NYMEX of which I should be aware?

Thanks. 

Jim 

i don't know whose id's these are.  they are not mine, but i know that they are still in use because i see them trading sometime.  check with lavorato and shankman on these.  

Greg,

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if these are valid books and ID's.

does this mean that on a volatility basis he thinks the options are attractively priced?  if so, i don't want him having any input to their pricing.  

Greg 
I you want a laugh read the Motley section about gamma trading. 
Crandall done 
Badeer done 
Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week. 
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us. 
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law. 
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today. 
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly. 
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point. 

Keep hearing silence............................. 

thanks for the help

Greg, the Call Center called me on Friday saying that your products had dropped off the WEB during the maintenance window on EOL.  The reason for this is that each month your product has a different Product ID, and your September product did not have the flag set to not suspend. I have set the flag in the database for product "53549, US WTI Swap Nymex LD Sept 01" so that it will not suspend in the future.  Also we have added a procedure in the Control Center to make sure we check for this near the end of every month so we set the flag appropriately for each new month's product.

Given what our announcement next week is going to look like,  do you think it is a good idea to issue some options to some key players soon after the announcement.  as sort of a down payment on bonus perhaps.  i think it would be best to keep it to a reasonably small group.  lets try to talk tomorrow and see if you have anyone we need to do this for.

we are bringing ebs into ews even if we don't change our reporting segments, so go ahead and pick them up.

Greg,
     A suggestion has been made that the EBS "Competitive Analysis" unit (4 people) be added on to my group, and that it continue to support EBS research/fundamentals needs.  I'm fine with this, but based on your comments earlier today (re: hesitation of integrating EBS into EWS), is this something I should embrace?  

-Scott 

PS.  FYI, I'm working with Delainey to establish a Marketing Intelligence shop in EES.  I think we can help them fairly substantially, both with strategic marketing support and on the tactical deal level.  I've hired a guy who has worked for me in the past, Kevin Golden, to head up this effort and to begin to develop the necessary networks and infrastructure.  

PPS  In the meantime, folks are compiling the necessary information to examine the outsourcing to the technical group.  Several new projects seem to be materializing, which could be candidates for outsourcing:  gas storage/flows, refineries (operations and outages), and near-real time ship monitoring.   

Your guys need you.  I'm completely out of control!!!

i talked with sanders yesterday about our reactions to this subpoena and the one from the state senate.  we are having a meeting on monday morning to discuss what to do.

As per our discussion - fyi

Lovely.  I would like to discuss this further. Can we set up some time Thursday pm? Kay, will you coordinate a time that works for everyone? Thanks.
California counsel have advised us that, in view of the broad authority given the AG to investigate unfair business practices, a court will almost certainly order us to produce our contracts to the AG in response to the outstanding subpoena.  For the same reason a motion to quash the subpoena directed to PG&E, which seeks the identity of our customers and their status as direct access or on UDC service, would also likely fail.  They recommend that we voluntarily offer to produce the contracts and concentrate on protecting the more sensitive commercial documents (such as the type of documents Dennis Benevides develops) from disclosure.  Even with respect to those they are not very optimistic, given that the AG is willing to enter a protective order committing to keep the contents of those documents confidential.

Please let me know if you concur with this recommendation or would like to discuss on a conference call.

P.S.  If we do decide to produce our contracts we will first have to notify our customers pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of the contracts.

have you had any feedback since we last talked?
Not a problem, I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Your assistant left a msg on Friday asking me to forward another copy of invoice.  I don't have electronic copy but can fax hard copy to you.  Plse advise fax number.

do you know that your receivables have been increasing over the past few months?  currently i understand that you have about $800mm in outstanding receivables.  i don't know what the aging looks like, but it seems like a big number.  we found this while we were trying to find out why we are having a hard time getting a handle on funds flow.

We have got people all over these things that know them inside and out.  This is all about managing the downside
since it all has been monetized away.  I would love to give them away but can not see any value to the
corporation in doing it at this time.  Once they have the other assets in order it might make sense to 
reevaluate.

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?

Jim Hughes

can't be today.  maybe later this week.

I'd like to buy you a beer at Keneally's if you have a chance...

Get some time on my calendar to go over some of this stuff either this week or next.  
It looks like you've accomplished a lot in redirecting our efforts.  we should talk about what happens next and where you see the major opportunities.
Regarding your request for help, you don't need help to refuse to accept "dogs and cats" while the BU  tries to keep the good investments.  Just refuse to accept the garbage without conditions.  Don't waste too much time playing investment cop on the BUs.  You have more important things to do.  Also, refusing to negotiate with the BUs is like going on a hunger strike.

Ken, Greg, and Dave,

Please review update and provide any comments.

Where to begin?

Here are the items currently accomplished
Reduced personnel associated with investments from 55 to 31.  This was a very necessary evil to get things in control.
Reduced individuals actually responsible for pursuing investments from 15 to 4.  This will choke down investment flow to a manageable level.
Completed full day meeting with entire team to lay out complete integration plans and process standardization program.
Place a 60 day moratorium on any new investments, while we get our hands around the existing portfolio and develop new strategy.
New company number and cost center is set up and will begin on 7/1 (in 5 days).
Assigned any "stranded" or "orphaned" investments to a senior member of the team.  All companies have subsequently been contacted to notify of new investment manager.
Notified HEOF investors (women and minority fund) of change in strategy.  Will be meeting with investors to negotiate change to key man provision on Friday.
Found space.  We will all be moving to the 36th floor by mid to late July.

Here is what is in progress:
Searching across the organization for any additional investments residing in miscellaneous business units.  I am currently in London, where 4-6 investments currently reside (depending on what you consider an investment).  I expect there will be 90-100 investments consolidated into this group once I am through.
I am already having to fight a few battles to keep a few new investments from occurring.  This includes in EES and Enron Europe.  Bad ideas, bad deals, bad structures.  Basically, repeating patterns of past failures.
We are undertaking a complete revamping and standardization of all our investments processes, including deal filtering, modeling, due diligence, all back office systems, portfolio tracking, comparable company analysis, term sheets, approval process, etc.  Each of these is a major task, but we are targeting the end of August for completion.
Identifying and establishing other support functions for the group, including legal, accounting, RAC, HR, PR, etc.  This is going well and everything should be resolved within 2 more weeks.
Began budget preparation for last 6 months of 2001.  Should be completed within 3 weeks.

The only item that I need help on is support in shutting down certain developing pockets of investment activity, and making certain that all merchant investments get transferred.  Basically, there are a couple of groups that want to give me the dogs and cats and keep things with potential upside.  Also, there are some efforts to make a miscellaneous investment here or there.  I am not willing to negotiate with the business units on these issues.

I was unable to update the NYMEX chart as the NYMEX site was inaccesible.

Note, the Nymex Chart is for comparison purposes only. The EnronOnline numbers have been adjusted 10-fold to be in scale with the NYMEX volumes for charting purposes.

note that his problems are not really corporate.   he has problems with allocations from ENA and Europe.

I always thought we were your problem children.
Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

how did my august position change?  i didn't trade any august today.

would you have any interest?

Greg - here is Randy's resume. He is the guy I was telling you about on Friday as we were walking out of the building. I think he could make Enron a lot of money.

they don't report to me, they report to mark

And you bug me about too many direct reports.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.

 

Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.

 

David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.

 

Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.

 

Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.

 

David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

is that the same as "personal reasons" ??

Don't know if you saw it, but your friend and mine Paul Addis is leaving AEP to "pursue other interests".

   

do you have an offer?  either individually or on the package?

Greg--I know you like good wine and I am selling some of my California Cabs. If you have any interest here is what I have:

'92 Silver Oak Napa Valley  2 bottles
'93 Silver Oak Napa Valley  17 bottles
'94 Silver Oak Napa Valley  3 bottles

'91 Silver Oak Alexander Valley  18 bottles
'92 Silver Oak Alexander Valley  3 bottles
'93 Silver Oak Alexander Valley  12 bottles
'94 Silver Oak Alexander Valley  29 bottles

'94 Caymus Napa Valley  48 bottles

'96 Chateau Montelena  12 bottles

All of the wine listed above has been stored in a wine locker at 55 degrees since it was purchased.

John,
 
It seems everyone has received some level of interest in some sort of combination of the Paper, Steel and Metals businesses.  I have discussed with Greg that we ask Bruce Garner to organize the expressions of interest and see if there is anything real here.  So he will be talking with Gold and others with respect to the Metals side of this.
 
Regards,
 
Jeff
 
Jeff,
 
To recap my discussion with Barrick today.  They are interested in what is happening here and would be interested in finding a way to participate in any potential MBO type opportunity.  They have an interest in the MG business, steel and then FP in order of preference.  
Barrick has indicated that they have the management time and interest in the support of a deal.  They have also indicated the willingness of putting in $150 mm in hard equity with the potential of using their name/credit for trading risk.  
 
regards
bruce

Jeff
 
Guys,
 
I know you are busy and this might be just a flyer but Barrick might be someone to think about if we are looking for Capital.  This note is from the head of Corporate Development and I know the CFO and CEO very well.  They are single A rated with $700 mm in cash on the balance sheet (net debt is zero).   FYI - their market cap is $6bn (abx ticker)
 
 We have had lots of discussions with these guys in the past about JV in trading gold.  I think they could move fast and be very discrete.  Let me know if you are interested in me talking or introducing you to them?
 
regards,
bruce
 
 
 

Tom,

i really do understand your concern, and i will try to expedite this process as much as possible.  i'm sorry that all of this wasn't worked out prior to signing the merger, but we put it together rather quickly.  we have built an incredible energy franchise here and neither of us, Enron or Dynegy, wants it to falter.  i will get you as much information as i can, as soon as i can.  i would be happy to hear any ideas that you have on providing more stability sooner.

thanks for sending the note, and i apologize for the uncertainty.

greg

Dear Greg,

I appreciate you coming down to the gas floor and providing us some information about what is going on.

One of the questions that kept getting asked had to do with who will be retained, and what we will be paid when we are retained.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?

I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.

What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. 

Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?

Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.

Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

	Thanks, Jim

I sincerely apologize if I said anything offensive, and really do appreciate everyone who is trying to help us solve our problems.  At this time we are suffering a severe crisis of investor confidence, and we were only trying to be honest about the things we have done as a company.  I certainly know as well as anyone else that many of these investment decisions were made by people who are long gone.  Hopefully those of us who are here can correct their mistakes.

I really do recognize and appreciate your work.

Ken and Greg

I am part of the Enron Tax Department, assigned currently to Enron Global Assets, previously to Enron India.  Your comment regarding the very bad investments Enron made in international assets is absolutely true.  Perhaps the assets themselves are not all that bad, Enron just over-paid, over-built or over-leveraged.  In some cases, I suspect we did all three!  

But that's not the point of this message.

When you make statements like you did in yesterday's Investor conference call it erodes EGA's ability to sell those assets (who wants to buy a very bad investment ?) and chokes the spirit of the employees who have remained loyal to Enron and continue to support the needs of EGA.  The 100 or so members in the EGA support group did not make the bad decisions.  Those were made by former and current executives, RAC, Enron's Board of Directors, and others who were well-qualified to make such decisions.  I cannot begin to tell you how hard Tax, Legal, Accounting, PR, etc. worked to make the best of what often-times looked to us to be a stupid if not bad investment.  

Many of those who remain have devoted several years to Enron's international experiment.  We've given up dinner with our families, weekend soccer games and campouts, in many cases we have even sacrificed our good health.  I suspect we will continue to make those sacrifices in order to close asset sales and efficiently return to Enron the remaining value.

Please, when you proclaim to the World the very bad investments Enron made, take some time to remind those of us who are left to unwind these investments that Enron is fortunate to have some very bright and dedicated employees diligently working to contain the damage already done.

Sincerely,

Mike Norris

Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to=
 you

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account. =20

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
 of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
 of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
 share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
 distribution under each of the three interpretations:

fyi - less PRC's, less average time on line, some process improvements - lots more that can be done.

Steve, Cindy, Dave
 
The following are some PEP stats on number of meetings at year end vs. mid year 2001; number of feedbacks completed between those two periods; average user session length, and average length of PRC (only at mid year 2001 -- we do not have a comparison on this with year end).  
 
Hope these are of interest to you.

I understand, but this is a difficult measure to build into a budget system, other than simply limiting the amount of capital you have available to meet your IBIT target.  We can't allow a dicision to cut IBIT by 90% and capital by 95% and call it a success.  The easiest way to control deployment of capital is thru a deal approval process.

My perception is that the Q4 and 2002 bugets are still only focused on IBIT.
I can easily make my numbers if I use a bunch of capital.  But how are we doing sending out the
additional messages to reduce capital deployed and to increase net income.  From this corner of
the world my perpsecptive is this needs more focus.  For all your free time....

GOOD JOB !!

Deborah,

When I met last w/you, Bill, and others, it was stated that Fastow's group 
was scheduled to move off floor 27 the weekend of 8/25.  I have just heard 
that they are not moving off until 9/8?  Is this the case?

Many Thanks,

i have kept in touch with Gildea and Brechbuhl.  i didn't really know Eckberg 
very well.  Powell is now an FCC commissioner, though i haven't kept in touch 
with him either.  i don't know if you remember james conforti, but i recently 
saw gildea and brechbuhl at his wedding in february.  give me a call when you

John,
     I had lunch today with David Ownby (plus, Brent Larsen and Michael Chang 
of RedMeteor.com).   David suggested that perhaps there could be some sort of 
arrangement between RedMeteor.com and EOL wherein each could benefit from the 
other's platform.  He was referring specifically to the refined products and 
crude oil areas (where they are primarily physical and we are primarily 
financial).  I am under the impression that there may have been some contact 
earlier this year between Enron management and Vincent Di Cosimo of RedMeteor 
and I had heard the names of Greg Whalley and John Sherriff mentioned in that 
regard.  Is that correct and did anything ever materialize?
     As you know RedMeteor and Vitol are in the process of formalizing a 
strategic alliance to "aid in their positioning in the global marketplace" as 
reported in the media.  And the person involved from Vitol, Mike Loya, is a 
person that I have known for years, but have not discussed this topic with 
him.  Is there anything worth pursuing with RedMeteor?
Regards,
Mike
     

we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with 
dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing 
anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts 
some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his 
technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with 
other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to 
them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team.  
he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward 
your message to him.

thanks for the heads up

greg

Joe,

I'm meeting w/Greg today about you.  I'll call you this afternoon or tomorrow 
morning.

Liz

Greg, 

I trust that you are doing well.? In reference to the email below, I will 
plan on calling you this week to discuss.? I have not heard from you, most 
likely due to your hectic schedule, but my enthusiasm remains extremely high.

Greg, 

I do hope you remember me, and that Liz Taylor passed the note on to you 
requesting a meeting with you regarding possible re-employment with Enron, 
but more specifically, employment with Enron Net Works.? I believe that you 
are running the efforts of that group, and I am more than excited to speak 
with you about employment opportunities.

Although you have interviewed me in the past for the crude oil options 
trading position (1996, my first year at Enron), the passage of time 
hopefully allows me to refresh you on my background, in brief.

Pursuant to working at Enron, I currently work at Chematch.com, a leading 
online, real-time B2B Exchange, concentrating in the petrochemical and 
polymer industry, but with reaches into the fuel products arena.? I was one 
of the first dozen employees. We were the first movers of our business type 
in this vertical.? My role here has been on the 1) business development 
efforts, 2) prime member on the venture capital raising process, and 3) prime 
member of the IPO process/due diligence team.? Most recently, I was promoted 
from Vice President to Vice President & Senior Officer, heading the entire 
content portion of our firm (petrochem.net).

Prior to joining Enron, I attended the University of Chicago Graduate School 
of Business and received an MBA with concentrations in Analytic Finance and 
Accounting.? Prior to that, I spent three years on Wall Street with Merrill 
Lynch and Prudential Securities, in in both investment banking and FI capital 
markets.

If you need a couple of quick recommendations from Enron, I would humbly 
suggest Fred Lagrasta, Jeff Shankman, Harold Buchanan, Donald M. Black, Greg 
Woulfe, and others of your choice.

Attached is my resume for your review.? I know the extremely busy schedule 
that you uphold, but would greatly appreciate the chance to meet you once 
again to discuss any opportunity you may see fit for me within your group.

Hey Greg,
I enjoyed interviewing with both you and Jim last week
friday. I would like to talk to you some more about
the opportunities available in Enron Networks. Two
areas I thought would be interesting would either be
helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to
enter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks is
in the process of entering.

A couple of things that I thought were interesting
about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most
business plans where the strategy is build the site
and the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volume
to entice other people to participate. What most
e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating
process, but in reality this has very little value
added unless the market is coupled with a
finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary
system for physical goods. We addressed some of these
issues in the ilogex business plan.

I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to
give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.
 I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.

Thanks,
Brad

Crude  -  Rather quiet day on the physical front with one Oman deal reported 
@ -10.  Mkt still expecting Chinese to come in and buy Oman once the diffs 
get down to the mid teens. However, AG is getting cleaned up for June 
loaders.  Reported that CPC Taiwan mutually agreed with a seller (Statoil ) 
to cancel a early June loader of Oseberg that they had bought a couple of 
weeks ago.  They say they won't rebook it now that the strike is over. 
Paper -  FTB's were off early on the back of announcement that Norweigian 
strike was over.  Recovered later in the day on the Brent recovery. 
Tapis weaker vs Brent with EFS @ 35 and Dubai weaker as well with EFS @ 2.28. 

Gasoil : Once again, Singapore gasoil lagged behind crude and other products. 
June swap traded between 26.35 - 26.60 usd/bbl with East / West at - 10 
usd/mt (versus - 8 usd/mt yesterday). Front-to-back widened with June / July 
at 0.15 / 0.30 and June / Q3 also improved by 10 / 15 cents/bbl. Crack under 
pressure with Q3 at 2.90 / 3.20, a drop of 20 cents/bbl.  Three sellers this 
evening : Onyx , Shell and Marc Rich with the most aggressive offer at 27.0 
usd/bbl or MOPS + 0.50,  Caltex bid a cargo at 26.30 usd/bbl or MOPS + 0.20 
but no deal concluded. 

Jet / kerosene : Regrade being sell down with June at 1.85 / 2.00 and July at 
2.40 / 2.50 by the end of the day.  With limited outlets for the prompt jet, 
front-to-back will be forced to open up so that some barrels will go to the 
storage. Four sellers this evening (including three majors) - Caltex, Shell, 
BP and J Aron with the most aggressive offer at 28.30 usd/bbl, but still 
attract no buying interest.

fueloil-physical price tread lower as bp n hinleong test the mkt without

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

Kristin,

Per Greg Whalley, we need to install the Executive Report Viewer on Dave 
Delainey's computer.  He should have access to everything that Whalley has.  
Approval, for now, will remain with Whalley.  Greg would like this taken care 
of ASAP.

Many Thanks,

Please respond to henri@hearme.com
Let's talk! 

Hey Greg! It was terrific seeing you and Mary at the wedding (thought I wish 
I had spent more time talking to Mary). Now that I'm back in the office, I 
thought I'd send you this invitation to talk.  In theory, as long as you are 
using Windows, it should work, though I've had recent reports of some 
problems with Netscape.  When you get a mic and you think I might be on-line 
at work, just click the link below, agree to the certificate, and we should 
be connected. If it doesn't work, I'll have to call you to walk you through a 
demo of our other stuff. Let me know. Take care, Henri P.S.  Ulrich is still 
so *serious*!

P.S.  If you go there and don't find me, I might not be on-line anymore.  In 
any event, you can bookmark my web address to connect later. 

Also - the first time you connect might take a little longer than usual:  you 
might need to wait for your browser to be VoiceCONTACT enabled.

Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

  TULSA, Okla., March 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Williams Energy Marketing & Trading
Co., a unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB), announced today that it is acquiring a
minority stake in Houston Street Exchange, a Web-based energy trading
exchange.

  Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
  Since the launch of HoustonStreet.com in July 1999, Houston Street Exchange
has established itself as one of the industry's most dynamic
business-to-business exchanges for wholesale power trading.  HoustonStreet.com
recently announced plans to launch new Web-based platforms for trading crude
and refined products at the wholesale level.

  "Emerging technologies continue to change the way the energy industry
operates, and HoustonStreet.com is on the leading edge of the revolution.
Internet-based trading has exploded, and we believe that this investment will
allow us to play a significant role in the development of new markets and
platforms," said Bill Hobbs, president of Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

  "The investment in HoustonStreet.com is just one piece of Williams'
eBusiness strategy," added Nancy Gustine, director of eBusiness for Williams
Energy Marketing & Trading.  "By acquiring a stake in this innovator in the

the future of energy trading" said Frank Getman, president and CEO of Houston
Street Exchange.  "We look forward to Williams' market strength and support in
creating the premier online energy trading platform across multiple
commodities."

energy products nationwide including natural gas and gas liquids, crude oil
and refined products and electricity.  The unit also manages its customers'
exposure to volatile energy prices using comprehensive risk management
services and creates customized energy financing solutions for producers and
end-users.

  About Houston Street Exchange

first Web portal for the trading of wholesale energy products.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

 <<Enron Proprietary Trading Proposal III.doc>> Dear Greg and John,

     Following up on the call we had with John
     on March 19, the attached Executive Summary
     describes a joint venture between Enron & WR Hambrecht,
     a securities capability focused initially on proprietary
trading
      of common stocks in the technology sector as the first
phase
     of a relationship which could expand further to take
advantage
     of financial market opportunities including equity
derivatives trading
     and market making, fixed income agency block and
principal trading,
     fixed income and hybrid securities derivatives, and ECNs.
The
     financial model provided envisions supporting a
relatively small
     initial effort to control enterprise risk as well as to
provide a setting
     wherein Enron and WRH can begin to work together.
Economics
     should scale well in tandem with the amount of committed
and
     reinvested capital.

     In order for Enron to investigate this JV opportunity in
depth, we
     would like to propose as a next step a meeting at your
offices wherein
     we may speak at some length to our ideas for
collaboration.

     In addition to this proposal, as discussed, we remain
interested in
        exploring a separate effort focused on the area of lease
securitization
     and would appreicate your guidance on how to proceed with
initial
     conversations within Enron on this front.

     Thanks for your consideration. I look forward to speaking
with both
     of you.

Mr. Bodily,

I was able to speak w/Greg this morning and I regret to inform you that he 
will not be able to join your class via video conference on April 3rd as we 
had previously hoped.  

Greg will have to leave Houston for some of our overseas offices beginning  
April 2nd for approx. two weeks (London, Tokyo & Sydney).  I do apologize for 
the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or 
no notice.  

Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and 
I will discuss them with Greg.

Liz Taylor
Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley

Greg,
I understand from your assistant, Liz, that you will be able to join my
colleage Venkat and I and our eStrategy class on April 3 10:00-11:25 Eastern
Time (9:00-10:25 Central) by videoconference.  That is wonderful news for
us!

We have a T1 line in our classroom and we can connect using two-way video so
that you can see the class members and they can see you.  I know that we can
also arrange to put your power point slides on one screen and your face on
another, if we wish to.   At some point we'll get your technical people and
our technical people to work out the details on the connection.  We would
want to verify soon that our systems are compatible.

We can chat about how to use the 85 minutes we have.  I was thinking that we
ask the students to prepare the digital case, The Transformation of Enron
1986-2000, in which you appear in a few segments in living color, and you
look great, I might add. Liz said she thought she could a copy of the CD
from Sherri, Jeff Skilling's secretary, or, alternatively, I'll be happy to
send you a CD.  In addition to the case, I would like to give the students
additional new material (accessible on the course web-site) about Enron's
new ventures in the online and electronic network world.  (We could use a
little help from some of your people to get the best materials, I suspect).

In class, we could have a case discussion led by Venkat and I for (say) the
first half of class, and followed by your presentation/talk for the last
half of class. Or we can give you more or less of the time--let's talk about
it.
I was hoping that you could direct the focus of your talk toward topics such
as the following:
1.  The strategy for new ebusinesses at Enron.
2.  Enron's strategic advantages and competitive positioning in the digital
economy.
3.  Examples of laws of network economics in the digital world
4.  Implementation of Enron's digital strategy.

We need to prepare specific assignment questions for the students to
prepare.  Some of them could be taken from the introduction to the case,
which we could supplement with additional questions from you or that we
devise together.

This will be a great experience for our students and for Venkat and I as
well.  And we are flexible about how much time you want to take and also
about your specific topic.  So please give me a call (or email) and we can
settle on a plan.

Thanks very much for your willingness to participate.

Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some 
dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could 
work out fine, it that's not too late.  

Liz

Hey Greg!

Though you're unavailable on March 21st to speak at Stanford, Stanford still 
wants YOU!!!

Will you please check your calendar and  propose some dates you can make it 
there--the class is about 50 Exec eds, CXO levels form high profile 
companies.  It would be an easy presentation--about 1hr 1/2 on "The evolution

which is an open forum for discussing E-Commerce issues.

What does Greg owe you for the champagne?  Is it $896.00?

Liz

the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair 
will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly 
rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or 
capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of 
them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a 
big plane.

Johnny,

Here is the agenda...

Enron At A Glance is an opportunity for 3-6 month employees to learn 
information about the individual business units.  March 1st will mark the 
third edition of the newly designed orientation.  Based on audience feedback, 
the New Hire Network Team is searching for creative ways to engage the 
audience and encourage deeper conversation on the stage.  

The Enron Wholesale Interview needs to focus on broad contributions to Enron, 
general business processes, and 2001 goals. Most of the wholesale business 
units have sent speakers to discuss their specific commodities, goals, and  
contributions to EWS.
Enron Networks  Beth Perlman
Enron Industrial Markets Tammy Mulrooney
Enron Global Markets Mike McConnell
You may notice Enron Americas and Europe are not included.  Their speakers 
are unavailable.  Thus, I will ask questions about the gas and power industry 
as well as examples of initiatives in Europe.  
We will also follow your interview with several pre-recorded interviews with 
lead commodity traders (i.e. Hunter Shively, Janet Dietrich, Dave Duran, 
etc).  They will focus on the trading responsibilities.

I will be interviewing you on stage.  During your interview, we will be 
interrupted by "Late Breaking News" concerning power peaker issues and 
describing how Enron makes money with this initiative.  This is a 4-5 minute 
pre-recorded video that runs on the screens behind our interview area.  You 
will not need to contribute anything to this video.

Here are the questions I have written.  Please give your feedback.

(1)  Greg, you came to Enron in 1992 while the gas market was deregulating 
and the power market was moving towards deregulation.  Tell us what you 
experienced during this time.
 (a)  What risks did Enron take then?
 (b)  Did the Enron leaders have a real idea of amount of opportunities that 
would open the gas and power markets?
 (c)  What was the atmosphere at Enron during this time?  Excitement?  
Frustration?  High Egos?
 (d)  Do you think that EES and EBS are experiencing the same type of 
excitement while they forge into undiscovered markets?

Interruption:  ENA Investigative Report (Part 1) - Late Breaking News

(2)  In 1996, you moved into the European market and lead the trading 
divisions in the oil and refined products.  
 (a) What was the atmosphere like in the International arena?
 (b)  Has the atmosphere changed over the last 5 years?
 (c)  What are some initiatives that are hot in Europe?

(3)   Enron is entering the Japanese market.  They are focusing on the power, 
foreign exchange and metal markets.
 (a)  What are their goals in these markets?
 (b)  What are their challenges this year?  in the next 3 years?
 (c)  What other opportunities area arising in Japan?

(4)  Enron Wholesale Services was created and announced in November 2000.
 (a)  What was the business purpose for this formation?
 (b)  What accomplishments/successes  have been made already?
 (c)  What is the business model for EWS?
 (d)  What characteristics does a market need to interest EWS?

(5)  Finally, EWS and its business units have been losing its intellectual 
capital, its people resources, to the other divisions of Enron such as EBS 
and EES.  
 (a)  What characteristics are you looking for in future employees
 (b)  Recruiting is offering a $5000 incentive to Enron employees referring 
people with trading skills.  What are your needs in this area?

Conclusion of interview:  You will exit the stage while I set up the audience 
for Part 2 of the Investigative Report.  Thanks for your time.

call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i 
heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but 
it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the 
notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.

Cathy,

Will Shankman be able to attend that one?  Liz

Hi Liz -

Mike McConnell should be available to attend all of the weekly budget 
meetings with the exception of the meeting on March 13th.  Mike will be on

I have actually talked with these guys before.  More than a year ago I 
think.  I may have an old copy of their business plan.  The guy I talked to 
was Frank Levy, their CEO.  Just out of curiosity I would like to talk to 
them again to see if they have anything going.

John,

How do you want me to handle pmt back to Greg for your return leg on Travel 
Air from the Super Bowl.  Greg mentioned that Enron may be picking up the 
bill for you.  If yes, just advise and I'll do up the payment request.  The 
total charges are $3,621.50.

Many Thanks,

Liz

just saw that Louis Dreyfus traded with us today.  good job!!

one concern though -- several of the new names that we see coming across show 
up for 1 trade and then don't come back.
are we getting any feedback from them on the WTI product??  it can't just be 
the size.

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

Fun Fun Fun

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

Please provide me with a hard copy.  Greg doesn't read e-mail regularly.  I

Thanks for copying me on this message.  Mike is in Venezuela and Jeff is on

Gentlemen:
The following champagne is available at 70% of approximate retail price. Also 
have interest in trading for red wine.  Retail prices derived from Spec's 
website or Winesearcer.com.  Wine has been stored at temperature controlled 
private wine storage facility.

Quan      Vintage  Wine         Retail
3  1990  Perrier Jouet Brut Fleur de Champagne  110 
1  1988  Piper Heidsek Reserve    65 
2  1990  Dom Perignon     125
1  1990  Veuve Cliquot Ponsardin La Grande Dame 100
1  1988  Taittenger Millesine Brut    85 
1  1992  Jacquart Millesine    29
3  1990  Roederer Cristal     200

Any interest??

by this ratio the rest ot the power group is really underperforming!!!!

This 250K came from about 3 MW.
We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

25th.

You're e-mailing me on Greg's address book.  It's because I responded to your 
first address from his e-mail and I thought I was in my address book.

Honey,  please feel better soon.  I'm saying a prayer for you right now.  I'm 
glad I put a smile on your face (and what a handsome face it is).    Liz

 Going
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine." - I don't understand.

I'm having a poor day.  Got to have thick skin in this business.
Hey, thinking of your beautiful "happy" smile makes me smile.  You certainly
deserve someone that brings that special kind of joy to your life.

He asked me to table it til this week.  Last week was full of activities
planning for the Analyst conference and tons of meetings about our problems
in CA (Power).

Sorry you're not feeling well.  Take care of yourself.    I had a lovely
weekend, thank you.  Edmond and I did dinner & dancing on Saturday night.
We had a picnic @ Allen Parkway on yesterday afternoon.  Followed by a
Super Bowl party for two.  This was a lot of fun.  We ate junk food and
drank cokes all night.  By 3:30a.m. this morning we both had a stomach
ache.

Am I sharing enough, to much?  I think I like me old way better.  Going
forward, you're getting "fine or not so fine."

Liz

I had a so, so weekend.  I'm tired, half ill, and working for some new
accounts.  Any word yet?

How was your weekend?

I'm sure you and Edmund had a blast - what did you do?

Good Morning Ken,

Good weekend?

if the good catch you are talking about was the profitability assumptions 
being doubled, i didn't catch it.  Pavel did.

Pd = change in price
V = volume per transaction
S = bid/offer spread
T = number of transactions

Profit =  T*V*S/4  -  V*(P2)/S??

I have on Greg's calendar the dates of Jan. 10 - 12 for Bonus & LTI Reviews

it is his job to talk.  he can't help himself.

you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

I Shouldn't Kevin report into the OTC for wholesale as we discussed?  Mark 
This has been reviewed by HR and Gene Humphrey.  Please respond with any 
comments.  It is intended to go out on Tuesday at noon.  I will have the

traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

i have a question on my p&l.  how did the hedge book make money on change in 
price when it was long and the market went down?

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.  As 
I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to 
contact him next week.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 

I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf. 

if i could only get IN the club, instead of being a mascot.

do you want me to mail a check, or what?

Mr. Piazze,

I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times 
in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:

When in the evening will Greg give his speech?
Who long is he scheduled to speak?
Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises 
to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so.
What is the dress code?

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

I'll try to give you a call tomorrow

Hi Bob,

I'll be sure to print your note out to Greg.

I have a couple of Enron folks wanting to come tomorrow.  Do you have two
tickets left?

Liz

Please respond to <bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com>

Greg,

Your keynote address hit the nail on the head this morning; it has already
spawned constructive discussions and debates, such as what services will
the
core exchange(s) offer, what are secondary and tertiary strategies, and how
will various companies in the value chain support and benefit from the
exchanges.  One editor commented that your presentation offered stark
contrast to the Chevron presentation during lunch, which was a much more
passive "bring the horse to water" approach.  Tomorrow and Thursday's
presentations will address many of your points more fully.

Thank you very much for taking the time to drive out.  I realize how
difficult carving a morning from your schedule can be.  However, the
industry benefited from your insights.  Hopefully, Enron Net Works will
receive some high-quality prospects and/or recruits in return.

They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch.  
Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen 
from here.  Even if the front stays relatively unchanged.

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to "soak up liquidity" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself," said 
Altra's Coleman. "But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another." 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply "providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace." 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "Big Brother" 
of the energy marketplace. 

"The historical information is not available," EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well." He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to "soak up liquidity" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself," said 
Altra's Coleman. "But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another." 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply "providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace." 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the "Big Brother" 
of the energy marketplace. 

"The historical information is not available," EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well." He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

I think we should discuss our response to this.

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other

Rick,

I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley 
conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

<RICHARD.WALKER@chase.com> on 09/11/2000 10:21:02 AM
Greg -

Thanks for giving some additional thought to sending an Enron representative 
to
Chase H&Q's Energy and the New Economy conference. I think your suggestion of
Mike McConnell is great  -- in fact I saw a piece on energy e-business in
Sunday's Chronicle in which Mike was heavily quoted albeit in his former role 
as
CEO of Enron Global Technologies. I don't know Mike well but met him a couple 
of
times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL
situation.

Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format.

The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 
-
15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for
audience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will 
be
questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all
panel members.

Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel
the moderator will be yours truly -- so I'll be serving up some softballs for
Mike.

The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are:

Houstonstreet.com -- Howard Smith
Enemetrix.com - John Gaus
Downstream.com - John Ireland

We are expecting good attendance from industry (both incumbants as well as new
economy types) as well as from the buyside. So far there are over 100
participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations between
now and the conference.

Logistically, Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 -- we 
will
work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel 
will
be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike 
will
be free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries or
whatever.

The full list of sessions  includes:

Distributed Generation
Communications
B2B
Investor Perspectives
Energy Exchanges
Energy Retail
Venture Stage
European New Energy

Don,

Greg would love to see you.  What about lunch on the 13th?  (He's in PRC all 
day on the 12th)  Lets say 11:30a.m.   We're located at EB2801.

Take Care,

Liz

Don Black@ENRON

Greg,

I will be in Houston for a few days the week of the 11th of September.  I 
would appreciate your help as a career guidance counselor.  I would like 
-+30mins of your time on the afternoon of the 12th or the morning of the 13th 
of Sept.  If this works for you, have Liz contact me to set something up.  
Thanks, Don

i would be happy to meet with him, but i need to know exactly when because my 
september schedule is pretty ugly.  we have talked with rappaport about their 
eNymex project, but they do seem to be struggling for strategy.  it is really 
surprising that they lost money.  how did it happen?  volume couldn't have 
been down, given all the volatility.

Sounds like a good idea to me

----Original Message-----

it might be a reasonable idea, as long as it isn't a weekly event

Mr. Nimocks,

Greg has decided that he would like to do the 90-minute panel.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

Liz,

We're considering one of two options:

In the first, Greg would make an independent 20 to 25-minute presentation
followed with 10 to 15 minutes of Q&A. Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger,
will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of
his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to
manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace
representing $120 billion in annual spending.  Tim will be followed by a
McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss
e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the
energy industry.  Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether
we start upstream and move down, or vice versa.  We finish at 11:00.

In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two
to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey. Under
this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.  The
director then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at
Texaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource
Management Services.   Each executive would have 10-15 minutes to discuss
his business model and the key issues that the industry must consider during
the next year, followed by Q&A to the entire panel.

Let me know if Greg has a preference to one of these two scenarios and we'll
try to accommodate it.

About the audience:
The audience is consistently made up of a confluence of energy and
technology executives.  About 30% will be comprised of energy professionals
interested in wholesale and retail trading.  For example, we already have
some 70 European gas and electricity executives scheduled to attend.
Cisco's London Office is arranging a Pan American tour for these executives
with a stop at Interactive Energy. Many other wholesale and retail merchants
will also be in attendance, including some large industrial buyers.  Heads
of energy procurement from Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall's (an
eight-state buying consortium's) have attended in the past.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,

Bob

Mr. Nimocks,

How long are you wanting Greg to speak?  What's the format for the
presentations?  Will there be a Q& A after the presentation?

Many Thanks,

Liz

Thanks, Liz. I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Mr. Nimocks,

I don't know if you have spoken w/Greg as of yet.  However, I do know he is
trying very hard to work this into his schedule.  I'll get w/him again
tomorrow morning for an answer.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.

Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the
keynote
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents
from
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year's to be
much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

Press Coverage:
The conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the
general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National
Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing
some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)
have
attended in previous years.

?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,
Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's
vision.

?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron
attended
last year's event.

?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this
area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of
working with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.

Yours respectfully,

Bob Nimocks

i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks 
and caicos is correct.  i would also like to find out what landing fees, 
international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book 
this trip.  the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that 
bids are subject to availability.  will availability be confirmed at the time 
i book the trip?  or will i have to wait some period of time to find out?

Mr. Nimocks,

Greg has committed to participate in the conference.  Give me until 
end-of-day tomorrow, for a format preference.

Many Thanks,

general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National
Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing
some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)
have
attended in previous years.

?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,
Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's
vision.

?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron
attended
last year's event.

?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this
area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of
working with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we 
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of 
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my 
current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO 
position.

Mr. Nimocks,

I don't know if you have spoken w/Greg as of yet.  However, I do know he is=

trying very hard to work this into his schedule.  I'll get w/him again=20
tomorrow morning for an answer.

Many Thanks,

Exec. Assistant to Greg Whalley

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.

Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the keynot=
e
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents fro=
m
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year=01,s to be =
much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

what do you think of this?
Hi Greg:
?
I have been fascinated by Enron's move into bandwidth for some  time now.? I 
firmly believe no company is in a better position to  understand the dynamics 
of the market or the importance of providing liquidity,  market-makers and 
transparancy to a market.
?
I am the CEO of a company called Bid4me.com, inc.? We are  an?start up with 
an eye for innovation in the internet solutions  field.? In particular, we 
are looking to bundle huge groups of small and  medium sized businesses 
into?blocks and force vendors to?bid  aggressively for their businesses in 
a?unique two-stage reverse auction  process.
?
We are?currently in stealth mode, however, our business  model so impressed 
Pillsbury Maddison Sutro, LLC (please see http://www.pillsburylaw.com ) that 
they  accepted us as clients on a deferred fee basis.
?
Our vision is to work with Enron to bring greater savings to  SMEs.??We will 
bring hundreds of SMEs' internet access demands at once  to several vendors.? 
Very few of them will be able to accommadate such  demand without appealing 
to companies like Enron for the provision of extra  bandwidth.? We would like 
to not only bring the SMEs to the vendors to bid  on but?to offer the vendors 
a bandwidth discount through exclusively using  Enron's market-place.
?
This way everyone benefits, including Enron.? Enron get's  a huge block 
demand for bandwidth and?its market-makers get the  revenue.??Enron will also 
gain greater credibilty through getting  increased liquidity flow.
?
The vendors, e.g. Adelphia Business Systems, benefit by  receiving a block 
discount through Enron and by receiving revenue from a large  block of SMEs.
?
The SMEs benefit by receiving savings passed on to them from  the Enron 
discount and through using the soon to be patented Bid4me  model.
?

Our website is currently housed on a Stanford University  Server.? ? However, 
very shortly it will be housed on our own  server.? So in the future you will 
be able to reach us at http://www.Bid4me.com

?
If you double-click on the section 'For angel's eyes only' you will find  our 
current business plan and financials.? Our financials were written by  two 
CPAs in London.
?
You might be interested to know that aside from just  developing our alpha 
website we currently have a small team from Stanford  University ( including 
three PhDs) working on developing our alpha  prototype.
?
Brio, Inc have recently agreed to furnish us, for a trial  period, with their 
software licences (Brio explorer and Brio designer).?  The licence fees are 
usually $5,000.
?
Edgar.com have permitted us to have a free trail of their software.
?
We are looking for at least $1.5mm to launch Bid4me.? If  you have any 
interest in funding us or in working with us in the future I would  be very 
interested to hear your feedback. 
?
Last thing: as we are still in the process of applying for a  patent I would 
appreciate your discretion.? Please do not forward this  password-restricted 
website to anyone outside of Enron Corp.

Kind regards 
?

to my knowledge, whenever we set up new gas books we always request all attribute types to be attached  (i.e. gas daily, basis, index, etc...).

Hope this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to Jeff, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  Andrea, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.

Parameters!!!

Three aspiring psychiatrists were attending their first
class on emotional extremes.  "Just to establish some
parameters," said the professor, to the student from
Arkansas, "What is the opposite of joy?"
"Sadness,"  said the student.
"and the opposite of depression?"  he asked of the young
lady from Oklahoma.
"Elation,"  she said.
"And you sir," he said to the young man from Texas,
"How about the opposite of woe?"
The Texan replied, "Sir, I believe that would be  giddy up."

Was in a meeting with UBS at this time.  Sorry.

Stacey

Can you have someone do this?  I forgot to put it on the group's To Do list for the week.  (Besides, I thought I would do it myself, but never seem to find time).

Stacey

Do you think you could get the PSEG MTM information to me by the middle of this week?  

Laurel

This is possible.  Probably won't be until tomorrow.

Stacey

We would really like to try to have all of the information related to PSEG by the end of this week.  Please let me know if this is not possible.

Thanks,
Laurel

We are in the process of trying to reach a final settlement with PSEG for all remaining settlements and MTM value of the future contracts.  They would like to finalize this by tomorrow or early next week.  I have told them that could be very difficult.  They would like to know when you expect the final reconciled numbers to be available.  

Jeff/Stacey/Michelle, 
Could you send me the MTM value for all Jan '02 and forward emissions, gas and power deals.

Thanks,
Laurel

I am helping Ed Baughman negotiate a final settlement with PSEG, and was wondering if you could send me the final Nov and Dec numbers for Fin and Phy gas, Fin and Phy Power and Emissions.  Please let me know when you expect to have the numbers available.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Does anyone know what the status of this change is for the West?

Stacey

Dear Casey, J.P.

The first version of new DprAutomation with Financial Swap Liquidation and other changes is ready for testing. The set of files is saved at 
M:\Power_devl\Test\Swap Liq\

Since the driver and folder are moving around at this moment, all files in that folder must be keeping under same folder.

The formula for Swap Liq is the same as previous agreement.

Also Swap Liq have been rewritten. It is automation row.  It can pull all files from Unix and without manually pulling them via PortCal. The Calculate time for each pair desk/region also has been cut from about 2 minutes down to about 5 seconds. Total time for adding J9 issue is less 5 minutes at this time.

For roll files, I change some tabs names to match their names in Oracle region name. Otherwise, DprAutomation can't work.
 
If you really need the regions names as your new rolls file, I am going to find a way to hard code mapping  them in DprAutomation. However, we think the best way is setup those change in Oracle database. 

All files in that folder are copy files. Any change only affects those copy files.

The tabs names I change in copy rolls are:
R1:  NY Zone G -> NY EAST 
R1A: PJM West -> PJM 
R1C: NY Zone A -> NY WEST
R1D: PJM EASTTERN Hub -> EASTTERN Hub 
R1Z: PJM WESTTERN Hub -> WESTTERN Hub
R3B: TVA -> Into TVA
R4C: Comed -> Into Comed 

I will continue to test, optimize and  polish the Swap Liq and DprAutomation.

Please let us know if there is any correction or any problem.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Min,

Our latest version of the working roll is in M:\Common\Power\Netco\East\Netco Roll Template Working 1-31.xls

We are waiting on you for final revisions to J9 before we start copying that file to create all of our rolls.  Just let me know when its ready tomorrow and thanks for all your help!!

Have a good night!
Casey

Casey,

I have finished all big pieces of "J9" and other which are related to DprAutomation. I will put all those pieces together.

Since all of us need to log off of our PCs tonight. I can't work tonight. I will try to make the first version before end of tomorrow.

Also, could you let me know where is your latest roll files location. I need to COPY those files to my PC and have a full test on those COPY files.

BTW, all of our accounts will be switched to UBS.  That change may impact PC and Excel setting. I will be my desk < 8 Am. Let me know if there is anything I can do.

Thank you!

Min Zheng

I didn't hear much more than that myself.

Stacey

Not much else. Thursday the judge will approve or deny the deal. There is not too much worry about the creditors apposing the deal as has been reported. It is a matter of understanding the deal better since they were on the outside looking in.

I heard that.  How was the floor meeting?

Stacey

UBS bought 100% of trading

Steven Luong and Nick are working on a better list with more specific names.  I'll keep you informed.

Stacey

I could not find anything for Georgia Pacific or somebody called WAMP. There was also an SPPC which I really think is SPP(in Enpower) which is Sierra Pacific Power Company.

John

What is the exact name for Georgia Pacific?  We do not see any transactions with them in the system.

We will need no additional curves.  Only those designated by the gas group will need to be moved.  Thanks for the heads-up.

Stacey

Stacey:

The Gas Risk group is requesting that we preserve only a specified list of curves/pub codes for 
NetCo/UBS, and to delete the rest of the curves from TAGG/ERMS.

Please provide a list of Natural Gas curves/pub. codes that you would like to preserve in NetCo/UBS.

I am attaching the list of Natural Gas curves to preserve that Kam provided, for your reference:

Can you please auto-schedule the following deals for December.  Please let Leslie and I know when you are complete.

Stacey

Deal #
114998
578961
578964

John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet?  I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday, so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify.  We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong, I guess.

Leslie - thoughts?

Stacey

even though scheduling may not be right, or even close? at least for the west.

The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

Stacey

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the fin liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the liquidations for Dec are not final? 

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have included that in the book requests?

John

Sonia,

Kim may have some changes to the seating assignments.  I believe these changes will also affect where Evelyn's settlements group sits.  Please coordinate changes and then send me a list of desk #'s and associated names.  I need to forward this information to Lloyd Will.

Harlan Murphy informed me that City of Redding has not terminated.  I asked him to have Stephanie Panus take it off of the master list as a "Y".  I called Steve Hall and Steve had Harlan call me with the answer to City of Redding.

Let me know if you need me to help with anything else.

Thanks,

I have not recompared the Master Log to the 'Physical Terminated' spreadsheet.  This is just an update of my initial review.  Any comments would be appreciated.  I have also not included the Auto Terminations that we found out about today.  After tomorrow's updates, I will do these.  We are planning on moving the auto-terminations identified by David and confirmed by Kimberly to the bankruptcy book tomorrow.

I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

I have to run, but call me tomorrow.  I have an idea of what your difference might be caused from.

Stacey

Please start the following task in the morning:

Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk:
Constellation 
Energy Authority
Sempra Energy Trading
Public Service of Colorado

I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.

Thanks,

I have an 11:00, so I will have to leave early.

Stacey

Each of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.

Stacey

 
Don asked me to send you this file.

As soon as we finish calcing our book on Friday, we should be good to go.  We will start as soon as possible.

With the amount of activity this weekend, our DBA group is facing the prospect of working all night this Friday to meet a Saturday 12:00 noon deadline to begin IT testing of the Estate production environment.

Is there any way we can start the outage at least a few hours earlier on Friday?  Please respond one way or another.

Thanks,  Steve

Good Morning,

To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.

Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the "PWRPRODN" or "PWRPRODN_DED" database aliases to "ESTPWRPN".

Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in "Schedule" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it "right" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Thanks - Merry Christmas!

Stacey, just wanted to give you a heads up that I am taking the 14th off. Folks are in town and this will be our Xmas day. Will be in the rest of the time going forward to ensure that we are getting everything done here.

John

This is possible.  Probably won't be until tomorrow.

Stacey

We would really like to try to have all of the information related to PSEG by the end of this week.  Please let me know if this is not possible.

Thanks,
Laurel

We are in the process of trying to reach a final settlement with PSEG for all remaining settlements and MTM value of the future contracts.  They would like to finalize this by tomorrow or early next week.  I have told them that could be very difficult.  They would like to know when you expect the final reconciled numbers to be available.  

Jeff/Stacey/Michelle, 
Could you send me the MTM value for all Jan '02 and forward emissions, gas and power deals.

Thanks,
Laurel

I am helping Ed Baughman negotiate a final settlement with PSEG, and was wondering if you could send me the final Nov and Dec numbers for Fin and Phy gas, Fin and Phy Power and Emissions.  Please let me know when you expect to have the numbers available.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

The e-mail was sent on 1/3/2002, but the detail states that "TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in the agreement between TXU and EPMI".  The e-mail does not give any details on ENA, ECC, of EES.

Stacey

I'm assuming it is as of Jan 3, since that's what's on the schedule, but I put a call into TXU to verify this.  

What date is the termination date?  Are these values as of last night?  Dec. 2nd?  Need to know which date to calculate.

Thanks

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled "other" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.  

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

(See attached file: Enron Jan 7.xls)

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

Harry

PS - I cant find Jeffrey Gossett in the email system, Stacey can you forward the email to him ( I dont know if he is an Ene employee)

Harry/Jay, can you help come to some conclusion on this.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Jeff

Please send a power and gas book request for Andy Zipper.

Thanks,
Stacey

Andy can trade all regions and all commodities (just like a desk head).    He is replacing Harry.

Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper?  Any other books needed for him?  Will he be allowed to trade all regions?

Thanks,
Stacey

I have two other meetings at this time.

Stacey

After talking to Tom I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.

I have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.

Other than Andrea who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.

Thanks,
Stacey

Here is the latest results from our valuation engine.  Please let me know if you see any mistakes.  We will update with your newest changes tomorrow, so you can exclude those from your evaluation.  I also noticed that their is a financial UI transaction.  I believe this was just an oversite and have asked Casey to look into it.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

I have already updated the Physical and Financial Terminated spreadsheets with these updates.  Please have your groups start the split/clean-up scheduling process for the new counterparties.

Stacey

Stacey/Casey:

I have attached the latest power terminations.  One deal number has been added to Omaha Public Power District.

Should we get 4 bankruptcy postids?
I am now getting 4 official post ids from EnPower for the bankruptcy books.  We used to get only 2 (East and West).  Should we be getting four (4)?  For the 4th of January we got the following Post IDS

POST_ID
15616
15622
15623
15628

Were those correct ?  If let us know when we should be getting a larger count on a daily basis.

John

East Bankruptcy POST ID for 1/7/02: 15647

Why is there still a financial position in the East portfolio for UI?

Stacey

 

Let me know if this is not what you need.

Stacey

Casey,

Can you have someone follow up with Hai and Harry and see how all these reports are working?

Stacey

I think we really need to get someone to ensure that the option sensitivity report is working and working quickly. If we are going to be trading a lot of financial deals then this would be beneficial. I know Hai did a lot of testing on it but I thought there were still problems. Am I wrong?

John

Please find attached the Integration Plan for Power Risk Management.  If you need this information consolidated or expanded just let me know.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Thresa/Stacey:

	Jim Meyn suggested I contact you to find someone in the settlements group that could answer the question below. Any help would be appreciated. Please call me at 5-4998. thanks

Eric/Jim:

	I am trying to answer the question below as it relates to certain receivables purchased by Sequoia. 

	I am having someone identify the Sequoia receivables from a rather large database [HOUPOW and HOUGAS] of gas/power receivables; however, I need to be able to identify exactly when the receivable was paid by our counterparty. If you are not the correct person to speak with, could you tell me who is?  Thanks.  JNE

The first question is, as of the relevant dates (November 29, December 2,
December 11, and for completeness, all intervening dates) did Sequoia,
Cherokee or EFP have assets other than Enron receivables? If so what were
they, down to particular receivables, and what was done with any proceeds
thereof?  For the purpose of this question and the proposed stipulation,
ignore EFP assets that have nothing to do with Sequoia.  If the answer is,
"on November 29 there were receivables in ______ (identify entity) that
resulted in subsequent collections of $_____ (amount) on _____ (date),
where were the proceeds deposited?  If in an Enron account commingled with
other funds, segregation may not apply.  If segregation applies, then the
DIP lenders may or may not need to consent.

Also, please look at the description in the stipulation of information to
be provided and advise if it accurately describes what we have already
delivered.  If not, please advise regarding any discrepancies.

Thanks.

Travis/Martin: can we agree to segregate and hold cash in trust, given the
DIP financing document?

Julia:  do we need approval of the cash committee internally before
executing? The creditors committee?

NOTE: amount at issue here is about $14,000,000.

True to form, Kelley Drye sent the form of stipulation and order last night
and want to submit it today.  Don't worry about the timing request, but I
would like your comments, particularly as to the paragraphs regarding what
we have or will deliver.  As for the segregation paragraph, all we agreed
to segregate were Sequoia assets.  I need to understand what is in the
other entities, if anything, before I tell them to stick it or agree
because we don't care.

Marty: Further to Bob Crotty's voicemail message to you of earlier today, I
attach a draft of the stipulation that we have been discussing relating to
production of documents and segregation in connection with the Sequoia,
Cherokee, EFP adversary proceeding.  Please contact either me or Bob Crotty
(212-808-7847) if you have questions or comments.  We would like to file
the
stipulation tomorrow.

Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper?  Any other books needed for him?  Will he be allowed to trade all regions?

Thanks,
Stacey

Looks good - you mention month-end deadlines.  You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L.

Stacey

If you wouldn't mind, have a quick glance over the spreadsheet and see if there is anything I missed that you think should be mentioned. This is for the training class and I was just trying to hit on all the main areas which is not in any particular order right now. It is a general overview, so not too detailed. 

John << File: Risk Presentation.doc >> 

I know of nothing in stage that I use.  I would like to make sure Casey and John both agree with me.

Stacey

Dear All,

	We are going to forever shutdown ( destroy) the EnPower Stage ( pwrtestp ) database in the near future, and would like to confirm if there is anything that should be saved or copied to another database. Please let us know.

	Thanks,

Norman.

Casey and John can get back to you on your specific question re: Canada.  However, I wanted to let you know that our DPR will more than likely not be final until Friday.  Hopefully we can get you all reports then.  We have had to leave the DPR open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 12-31 data as clean as possible for the estate.
 
Stacey

Stacey,Casey and John
 
Can you guys let me know which books still have deals with Canada?  If so,  are they still in the original files or have they been moved to another book.   As you can see below, the request for the Estate information is begun.   Please let me know if you have any problem getting the liquidations to me sometime today or early tomorrow morning. 
 
John - Do you have a Dpr for 12-31?  If so could you copy it to the report directory.  
 
Let me know if you have any questions, or problems gather this information.
 
Thanks
Tracy
 
 
Tracy Greene
There are a few things that we need to compile for the Estate.
 
1) Please load your December liquidations into your "flash" database so that I can get a good number for Gas December liquidations.
 
2) TG - need your liquidation file from power risk.
 
3) We need to find out which books have deals with Canada, gas and power.  For the gas books, these deals had to remain in the original book because  risk could not move these to the Gas Price book because of the pricing structure.  TG - for the power books, can you check with Stacey?
 
4) Also, we need to get a list of books, gas & power, that have a gross book balance as of 12/31/2001.
 
Put your lists together in the attached template and send back to me.  Let's try to have this data "rounded" up by tomorrow morning at 10:00 am.  I'm sure that this will not be all the data that is needed, but I'll let you know as soon as I get the requests.
 
thanks for your help
 
 
Tracy Irvin

Please let me know your thoughts on the following correspondence.  We are in the process of putting together our integration plan and the interest rate curve is one of our biggest stumbling blocks since the interest rate group will not be going to NEWCO.  As you can see, your name has been volunteered and I need to know what all you will need access to in order to get this curve to the Risk Management groups on a timely (preferably 2:00 p.m.) basis.

Thanks,
Stacey

FYI....
Assume Harry Arora will help us out.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Jeff

Wonder if he knows this?

This looks good.   I originally had a headcount of 11.  If you added one to my headcount, then I agree.

Vlad,

Here is the latest book list based on book requests.  The one item I know has not been requested is Andy Zipper as the LT-Option trader.  When we request this and it is complete, we will send you an update.

Stacey

 

Would 10:00 our time work?

Stacey

That would be fine. 503-287-0052 or I can come in. Either way works.  Earlier the better for me. 

They are rotating one person out a day starting Monday.  We will not be setting up the West books.  I would like to meet with you and Casey Monday morning if possible.  You can still be at home as long as we can call you.

Stacey

When did you want to meet with Casey and I regarding how we will proceed going forward, i.e. new books, system set up, etc?

John

I believe two of you is fine.  We have stopped our rotation in the East and will have lots of work to do re: setting up books, continuing with terminations etc.  Until it becomes evident, continue on.

Stacey

Heather and I will both be out Monday as part of the schedule rotation. Fran and Sam will be here. We will be alternating days off unless something comes up.

We have been officializing every day and the information is obviously as good as the curves.  Every other Friday is just as good as any other day.

Stacey

Are you guys comfortable with every other Friday being the day when Old Co has the best calc?

Go ahead and include counterparties on our power list even if they do not have any outstanding trades.  That way, if anyone is comparing our lists later on their will be no discrepancy and they won't have to ask us again.

Thanks for all the other information.

Stacey

Stacey,

I have reviewed the section on the attachment of counterparties on the master log with a "Y" but not on the physical power terminated list.  BP Energy Company is on the physical power terminated list.  With the exception of the four new companies that appeared on the master list today and Ameren, we do not have any trades flowing after December 1, 2001 with the other counterparties.  I have not been including counterparties on the list if we don't have any deals flowing December 2001 on out.  If I need to include companies that we don't have outstanding trades with let me know.

Niagara Mohawk has been purchased by Select Energy New York, Inc.  Tonight Global Counterparty is going to replace the Niagara Mohawk name with Select Energy New York, Inc.  I have been waiting on global before adding Select to the termination list.  I have not heard back on Ameren yet.

Once I have an answer from David on the other terminations (by alternate source) I will let you know.

Thanks for organizing the information from all of the e-mails.

Let me know if you need anything else.  I will be sending an updated physical power termination list today.

Thanks,
Melissa

Please review and let me know if I have misrepresented any counterparties.  If you want me to add comments, send them to me and I will incorporate.

Thanks,
Stacey

David,
Just to make sure you know, the Power Physical Terminated Transactions spreadsheet, is put together by Melissa from information she has received from Master Log and other.  This is our primary source for moving transactions into the bankruptcy book as she review to ensure that the contracts terminated cover all our trades.

Thanks,

Fine by me.

Dear All,

	The Gas Database will not be available this coming Saturday and Sunday Morning, PortCalc will not be able to evaluate any Post ID due to the lack of Interest Curves, etc.

	Please let us know if that is a concern ASAP.

	Thanks,

Norman.

TAGG/ERMS/CPR database will be down from

January 5, Saturday at 8AM to

so that database maintenance can be made

e-mail me if you have any issues otherwise a
no reply means it is ok.

Francis S. Lim

As of now I should have no employees on the Estate list.  Israel Estrada was on the list previously, but we have moved him to Power Global Rates in Netco.

Stacey

I know we have all been worring about the Netco list.  

Can you please send me who you think is still here and on the estate list.

I just want to check my lists.  (Maybe I can get a job as Santa next year check lists).

thanks

bob

Can one of you resend me the unarchive shortcut to 2000 data?

Stacey

Here is the latest Master.  It is kind of a cluster.  The easiest way to pi=

Christina,

Just wanted to let you know that Donnie will be joining us for the 11:30 meeting.

Thanks,
Stacey

 I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:

1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) . 

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of "Unify" for instance, will be too broad.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 
Please plan on attending a "Best Practices" meeting coordinated by Sally Beck on:

	Date:		Tuesday, Feb. 5
	Time:		11:30am - 1:30pm (lunch included)

They are all good.

Now that Will has been cleaning out scheduling tables, will you ensure that the prepays in the document below are still in the scheduling system.  If they are not, we can autoschedule them.  

Thanks,

In answer to your question, it is a prepay. I am sure there are more deals than what is showing on this list.

John, this details the agreed upon prepaid transactions to satisfy STSW in the money positions.  If you have any questions please contact myself or Tom Alonso.

Melissa,

Here are some more to investigate!

Stacey

Though LG&E Energy Marketing Inc. ("LEM") has not delivered EPMI notice thereof, the wholesale power trading relationship with LEM should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in Section 4.2 of the 1-22-97 Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement between LEM and EPMI.  No further scheduling of trades under that master agreement should occur. 

Though Cargill Alliant LLC is not being served currently, please note that the December 1, 1998 Master Energy Purchase & Sale Agreement with Cargill Alliant LLC terminated effective 12-2-01 by operation of its automatic termination provision.  

The "restore services list" immediately below has now been revised to reflect these automatic terminations.  Please let me know if you have any additional information, questions or comments.  --David

     

Though TXU has not delivered EPMI notice thereof, the wholesale power trading relationship with TXU Energy Trading Company should be considered terminated effective December 2, 2001 by reason of an automatic termination provision in Section 4.2 of the 4-1-98 Master Energy Puurchase and Sale Agreement between them and EPMI.  No further scheduling of trades under that master agreement should occur. The "restore services list" below has now been revised to reflect this automatic termination.
Please let me know if you have any additional information, questions or comments.  --David

 << File: 12-21-01 restore services list (1-3-01 update).doc >> 

The attachment reflects updates reviewed this afternoon arising out of additional credit war room files. Please note that the following counterparties should now be considered to have terminated their wholesale power enabling agreements with EPMI, and performance under any transactions with such parties, if any, should cease: 

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC, 
CP&L, 
OG&E, and 
Southern Illinois Power Cooperative.    

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

All:  We had set aside slots on NETCO for two EES resources. (Pablo Pissanetzky and Kenny Ha)  Pablo and Kenny have opted to pursue other opportunities.  Min Zheng (Risk) and Bala Kandaswamy (VMS) will be shifted from ESTATE to NETCO.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

One more to look for.

Stacey

This confirms that Ogelthorpe Power Corporation delivered to EPMI a 12-19-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 12- 20 -02 a single open trade Ogelthorpe had with EPMI,  a Jan-Feb '02 75 MW Into GTC sale by EPMI effected 9-19-01 under a confirmation dated 10-5-01.

See point 2 below - just wanted you to be on the lookout for MidAmerican.

Stacey

1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.   

2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.

Stephanie and Susan -- This remains a priority.  Please e-mail those persons identified above when a termination letter comes in from any of the below-listed East Power counterparties, and give a copy of the letter received to one of the listed power trading attorneys for immediate review.  Following a meeting this afternoon we will have a moire fully defined procedure and distribution list of names for communicating regarding the listed counterparties.  I will visit with you this morning so that we work out any questions you may have about this.  Thanks. --David
 
Stephanie -- Please keep watch for termination letters coming in from any of these counterparties and make me aware immediately of anything received --also Elizabeth Sager, Marcus, Harlan and Leslie.  We may be resuming the scheduling of power with these counterparties but will not do so with a party that has terminated its enabling agreement(s) with EPMI.  Thanks.

Attached is a list of the EPMI terminations.  The 12-20 list may contain additional EPMI counterparties that have not yet been added to the Master List.

No I had another meeting at this time.

Stacey

Did you go to this meeting?
Attached is a soft copy of the sheet we discussed earlier.

After chatting with Jim, I've removed EES and additionally added Canada.

B.

 << File: Recoverability Values.xls >> 

We have many deals in the system with UI, but they are all part of one contract.  To my knowledge, this is the only big contract we have with them.  Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal.

Stacey

Stacey,

I have attached updated termination lists.  FirstEnergy and GPU have been added to the attached spreadsheets (along with a few other counterparties not referenced in your e-mail below).  United Illuminating has terminated as well but we are researching which trades are terminated.  I will let you know once the research is finished.  I spoke to David Portz about the other counterparties listed below.  He said they are all terminated and we should be notified on the next list we receive from legal.

Have you seen documentation on these counterparties?

Stacey
Below is an updated list of recent contract terminations.  I believe we need to review our internal notification system to make sure this information gets distributed in a more timely fashion.

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Just wanted you to be aware of our concerns regarding Min Zheng.  He is our Excel support and is called upon on a daily basis for help.  

Thanks,
Stacey

Steve, I wanted to send this email in reference to Min Zhen with regards to the fact that he has not been included as one of the employees that will be a part of the new company. I wanted to make you aware of the fact the West and Canada power risk management groups consider Min to be a vital and very important part of the IT support that we receive. His knowledge and understanding of several very important excel macros that we use daily is critical to the success of our groups. It must be noted that on several occasions when other people were asked for help in areas that Min supports, the response was slow as people tried to understand what the problem was and how to fix it. I feel that is very important and necessary that Min be a part of the staff for the new company to ensure that all the risk groups continue to receive the exceptional support that we have come to expect from him.

John

I spoke to Tim today regarding the prepayment transactions with terminated counterparties.  He constructed this e-mail in response.  Hope this clarifies.

Have a Merry Christmas,
Stacey

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

This is the latest draft of pre-bankruptcy pay-outs.  I have put all the information I have, please add any that you may know.

Have a Merry Christmas!

The request is for the East and West portfolios (non-terminated).  Don't forget to include Capacity and show separately in queries. By Portfolio, by Counterparty, by Category Code - P&L and delta by month.

Also send a P&L update to Elizabeth Sager and Don Miller.  The original files are 'East by Counterparty' and 'West by Counterparty'.

Stacey
Stacey,

In talking with the Estate team, it sounds like they will be needing a few different types of info to help in the unwinding process.  In addition to the MTM reports you guys have been putting together, could we also do a delta position report by month?

Also, it would be helpful to get a list of deal specs and terms for each counterparty, basically like we were working on for David Forster before the bankruptcy.  I'll check with Kim Theriot on this as she was putting the list together before, but we will also want to get a MTM breakdown by deal for each counterparty.

These requests are not super urgent.  Basically I'd like to get the breakdowns sometime in the next week or two.  Hope that is OK, as I know you guys are inundated with requests at this time.

Let me know if you have any questions or if this overlaps with any other requests.

Thanks.

In order to point to the UBS environment in EnPower you need to change your PortCalc Host to the following.  This screen is reached through Tools - Option Environment.  Also, copy the PortCalc Host into your FTP Host:

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

I was out of the office yesterday when you called.  It looks like you have received as much information as we have from Jeff.

Thanks again for your continued help.  Hope all is well.

Stacey

Hi,

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

James

I ran deal data for the counterparties we received termination notification on today.  I did not want to start moving deals while you were running calcs, so we can just do this tomorrow.  The deals are on the 'East New as of 12-19' and the 'West New as of 12-19' tabs.

Stacey

 

P.S. Don't forget about Will's new application in stage.

Stacey

I have put this file together for our investigation.  Have to run to a meeting, can discuss later.

Stacey

 

Good News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  Will Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.

This is the latest list I have received.  I will forward you any updates.

Stacey

How do we want to go about this?

Stacey

To all,  The Enron Net Works infrastructure team is gathering requirements for all common data needed for NEWCO.  This includes Gas/Power commercial data and related trading support data. 
Based on the amount of data it can take significant time to migrate so we are on an aggressive schedule.  We need assistance from key individuals within each related business unit.  Please respond with a list of individuals that may be able to assist.  This will be a short effort with the right representation.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Mike Croucher

 

Let me know if anything sticks out as peculiar.

Stacey

Who else should I send this to?

Stacey

Dear All,

	After the Windows Accounts migration tonight, our UBS traders will not be able to access the Estate EnPower Curve Manager. We are going to copy all the existing Curve data and files from the Estate to the UBS servers tonight. This would be the Final copy, so the UBS Curve data is considered Production data.

	Starting tomorrow, please let the Estate Traders mark the Estate Curves, and UBS traders mark the UBS Production curves.

	Estate Curve Manager will NOT be available between 8:00PM 2/4/2002 and 10:00AM 2/5/2002.

	UBS Curve Manager will be available starting 10:00AM  2/5/2002.

	Please let us know if there is any questions or concerns.

	Regards,

Norman.

PS. Kathy, please contact Min if you need help on Alberta's Excel Position Managers ( Curve) files.
	

What are you talking about?

Stacey

Guess we are not going to Chad's  then.

We will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow.  Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.

Before kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by Will that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.

Before recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact Debbie Brackett or Stephanie McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.

We should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.

When running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and Cara).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.

Tomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!

Stacey

 

In addition to running the East and West portfolio calculations we will also be running the bankruptcy books on a daily basis.  These should be run as 'Official AdHoc Full Book' but NOT OFFICIALIZED.  

The post id numbers should be e-mailed to Debbie Brackett, Stephanie McGinnis and John Powell before you leave for the evening.

Thanks,
Stacey

Debbie,

The bankruptcy post ids for 12-18 are 15296 and 15297.  The data should be available first thing in the morning.  Norman is running the calcs for me because I was receiving error messages.

Stacey

Norman,

If the post ids change or the data is not available by morning please reply to all to let us know the status.

Thanks,
Stacey

Melissa,

I was told that Grant County was also terminated and is on Kim's list, but I have not seen it on our updated master power list.  Can you let me know the status of this counterparty.

Thanks,
Stacey

 << File: Physical Power Terminated.xls >> 

Stacey/Casey,

There is only one new counterparty on the attachment above.  Please note all trades with TXU Electric have been terminated except for the three deals listed on the spreadsheet.

We are in town so count us in.  I am TOTALLY planning on getting loaded (on munchies).

Stacey

I don't remember the last time I was "loaded"  :)

If you are a parent are you allowed to get "loaded"??

I am not sure why these did not show up yesterday, maybe my query was incorrect.  However, the following spreadsheet contains terminated counterparties that still show up in the West portfolio.  Let me know that you have or have not corrected it.

Thanks,

Attached is a spreadsheet with marks as of 12/18/2001.  If you need anything else, please let me know.

Christina,

Please add the following items to our issues list.  I have talked to Leslie about these and she will be able to talk through them on Monday.

1.  Determine whether or not we need to establish POA's for cash accounts.
	This is a Day 1 issue.  Please insert after the 'Set up new cash accounts and lock box'.

2.  Determine whether or not financial commodity trading, other than power and gas, will be allowed in order to ensure that all adequate curves, indexes, etc and being established in the rate system.

	This is a Day 1 issue.

3.  Need to set up meeting to discuss approval processes for new curves, books, settlement indexes after Day 1.  Suggested groups to be involved: Market Risk, Credit Risk, Finance and Control, Operations.

4.  Discussion around the use of Enron's 'New Counterparty' methodology.
	This is a Day 1 issue.

Thanks,
Stacey

Please split the following deals into their respective pre and post bankruptcy desks:

Counterparty Name	Trades Terminated	Early Termination Date	
			
AES Eastern Energy LP	775220, 814567, 821656, 821666, 842776, 842777, 857752	12/11/2001	

Thanks,
Stacey

Just wanted to make sure you had the latest files of terminated counterparties.

  

John:

So far I know we have three lists going around associated with moving west deals to the bankruptcy portfolios:
   
The first list is what I got from you => we added the deal comments together.
The second list is from Casey => Sam and I changed the deal termination dates in each deal 
The third list is from Will Smith => Will Smith changed the deals listed from the original desk to the bankruptcy desk

However, I am not sure if these three lists together provide the whole picture of what we have done so far.  Per Stacey's instructions, after we changed the termination dates, I exported ad hoc for the bankruptcy and west portfolios and found below issues:
 
a. some counterparties showing up in the bankruptcy portfolio are listed in any one of the above three files.  Please see this attachment and look at those not highlighted in yellow.
 
b. for some counterparties we still have deals in the days after the termination date.  Please see this attachment and look at those highlighted in orange and red.
 
* AQUILA: please check out deal # 656568 and # 569156.  According to Will Smith's list, the termination date for AQUILA should be 11/30/01.  However these two deals are not changed accordingly.
* ELPASOMERLP: according to the termiation dates list (from Casey), are we terminating all deals with this cp on 12/3/01?  If yes there are a bunch of deals left unchanged in the west portfolio for the rest of the month.  For example, #883630 has volumes for 12/4/01-12/31/01 under STNW desk.  There are many more deals like this.  Please search in deal entry to see all.
* Same case for MORGAN.  Example # 884431.1 in which we have volumes for all December 01' but according to the termination dates list, the termination date for this counterparty should be 12/7/01
* SMUD: please check deal# 647957.  This financial swap is still as it has been, i.e. under LTCA book for Q2 02'.  But according to Will Smith's list, the termination date for the counterparty should be 11/30/01?

If you could please help me look at this I will appreciate it very much.

Thanks,
Fran

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.

Stacey
 

Thanks for the offer, I have a Dr's appt.  Maybe later this week.

Mid C is R9, but WSCC-N is R8.  A 'B' indicates a basis curve which WSCC-N is not.

Have you talked to Bruce from Chase re: these files?

Stacey

I thought Mid C was R9 and WSCC-N was B8?
Thank you for your help.
Evidently they are looking at removing BPA deal, and we wanted to understand the changes in VAR because of it.

Attached is the file you are trying to reconcile, which I've already reconciled.  Reconciled is New file.1,  Old file is EnronVarcurveshift II

Care to grab lunch?

What is the curve code for WSCC-N

Also, do you have the breakdown for BPA volumes by peak and non-peak and reference date?

Thanks
Frank

What did today's look like?  Do we still have the same problems in power?

Stacey

Current open items are:

Weather - looks like there are still probs bringing this stuff in.  Ramesh, would you have time to work with Todd and see if you can track down the problem?
Freight exotic - this hasn't been officialized for days - what's the status here?
Gas - they are still working to officialize the 12ths (should be done by 10 am this am) and then will do the 13th - there were problems deleting the interdesk transactions.  Jeff will let me know when they are done and we can rerun VAR/credit.
Power - a few EPMI books showed up.
Lumber - I probably need to reload the 12ths, but waiting on confirmation.
Liquids - a few exotics books showed up as well as 1 UK book that has been officialized in the recent past, I'm not sure of the status of these going forward.

Also, do you have the breakdown for BPA volumes by peak and non-peak and reference date?

Thanks
Frank

When you get a chance, give me an update on this.

Stacey

Andrea:

Thanks for doing that for us.  I also did a check by looking at ad hoc exported after the bankruptcy calc is done.  I believe there might be some deals that were missing in the process of changing the deals and moving them from west portfolio to bankruptcy portfolio.  I will be out starting from 12/17 on vacation.  I will ask John to confirm if there are more changes needed for the cleanup.

Thanks again,
Fran

John and Fran-

The Creditors committee is coming in this afternoon and requested reports showing the value of the deals we have in our bankruptcy portfolios.  Given the time crunch, I ran the WestBank calc also and included in the information I sent to Debbie Brackett.  There were a few counterparties that I deleted from your query because they were not listed in the Terminated Counterparties file.  They were BPENERGYCO (Financial Deals, but net value = $0) and PUDSNOHOMISHCTY (Financial).  I also did not have time so see if all of your Dec-01 information was correctly split based on each counterparty's effective termination date.  Did you guys have a chance to go through that information?

Thanks!

Debbie-

I have attached two Excel files representing the P&L by counterparty for all deals in the East and West Bankruptcy portfolios.  Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

Thanks!

Andrea

 << File: 12-13 East Bankruptcy Counterparty.xls >>  << File: 12-13 West Bankruptcy by Counterparty.xls >> 

got it!  Hope everything is going well.

Stacey

I have like 3 different e-mail addresses for you, so I'm checking to see
which one works.  Let me know if you get this.

Congrats again!

Kelly 

The bankruptcy post ids are as follows:

East - 15221
West - 15222

Let me know what else I can do.

Just curious, what was Nick doing when he visited Houston the beginning of November.  Just wondering, because I didn't know he was here.

Stacey

Thanks

As long as HR is ok with this, so am I.

Stacey, part of my relocation package was the $700/month mortgage subsidy. In May, I received the first installment for one year and due to the current situation with the company and with Enron at this point unsure about helping with a potential move back to Houston, I wanted to receive the second installment as soon as possible. Frank is ok with this, but I wanted to check with you before anything else is done. 

John

I will attend.  

Also, is there someone who objects to sending invitations through the calendar tool?  It is a much more efficient method of getting meetings on the calendar.

Thanks,
Stacey

Please plan on attending a "Best Practices" meeting coordinated by Sally Beck on:

If you get a chance, give me a call.  Can't wait to hear all the London scoop!  I hope you are well despite this disaster.

Stacey

I heard you got information on Monica.  Could you forward it to me?

Thanks,
Stacey

I'm all right.  In denial a little because I really do not want to work anywhere else, but oh well!  How are you?  Did you get a chance to talk to Monica?  I hope they are o.k.

Stacey

So sad!

How are you doing?

If you guys have been keeping up, you know Enron Europe is waving the white flag and shutting down.  Our email addresses (and our jobs!) are being deactivated as of midday tomorrow, so you can reach us at:

We obviously don't have an elaborate backup plan yet, as we were too busy working for the "The World's Leading Company".  So we can't say where we will eventually end up, but please keep in touch and let us know how you all are doing.  We miss working with all of you guys.  If there is an email list for Portland put together, someone send it our way.  

Hang in there!
Monica and Kristian

 Please forward this to anyone we might have missed.

Here you go.  Sorry for the delay.  Please let me know what else I can do.  The file is subtotaled to include Peak and Off-peak together.  It includes both positions and current MTM as of last night.

I'll let you know if I hear anything.  I have absolutely no idea at this point.

Stacey

If something does come up this weekend regarding work. I am definitely available to help.

John

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

 

Hey guys, 

We need to try and get this populated today and distributed.  Can each of you please take a look at the assigned section and let me know your comments.  The only thing we are trying to do here is identify the activities of the Estate and what needs to be performed by the resources in each group.

Cara & Mike will you please update the scheduling and trading areas? 

Stacey, will you please update the risk area?

I will work on the settlements / volume Management and I will work with Dave Steiner on the IT section.

Thanks so much for everyone's help.  I'm sorry I'm out of the office today.  We really need to get this done ASAP to help management understand who is available to assist in this time of transition.

Thanks - MO

Tom,

After our call today Mike Purcell and I spent a little time talking.  We also have some time schedule to Cara and Jeff Richter tomorrow  I have put together the attached  template which I will hopefully have filled out for you by tomorrow afternoon.

Our biggest concern today was how we would address the Real-Time scheduling requirements.  Mark Guzman is part of the estate and should be able to cover the day shift during the week and we can outsource to UBS to cover all the other shifts (Just a proposal).  In addition, Lester Rawson is part of the estate and has Real-Time experience and is also the individual who currently manages the El Paso obligations.

If you have any questions please give me a call @ 503-702-9846.

As of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions:
  Please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls.  Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below.  As of tonight, please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow.  Also, remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day, so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions.  These amounts should also be top-leveled.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

All deals were killed with Constellation, The Energy Authority and Public Service of Colorado.  This will cause us to have huge prior day values today.  This spread sheet has the P&L for all deals with those counterparties and Stacey will let us know what adjustments we need to make.

J.P.

 

When does she leave?

Stacey

Stacey, based on what happened, I wanted to communicate with Fran a plan for the upcoming weeks. She is planning to take 2 weeks off for vacation and was thinking that may have to be cancelled due to staffing. Let me know if and when you would like me to talk with her.

John

Please make sure you cc: me on all requests that you send out to credit, VaR, etc for the banks.  If you are not sending something via e-mail and you are just giving information over the phone.  Please send me the information as well.

Thanks,
Stacey

I was in a meeting last night to discuss who was critical.  I do not know if that list has been blessed.  The list we put together would definitely get us a through especially since we will not have all the old deals.  Your normal contacts should be there - Norman, Zhiyun, Min, Duong Luu, Will Smith.

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

Where is the DPOS folder?

Stacey

No prob.  Can you request DPOS through ERequest - I believe we still do it that way.

My group is now:

Shona
Chris
Susie Ayala
Susan Trevino

I'm putting together a list of everything we used to do and working on determining which things we should prioritize.  Until I complete that, can you ensure that all requests for info go through me?

Thanks a million!

Shona

Shona -

Can you get Stacey and I access to the DPR in executive viewer.  Also,  can you get us acess to the DPOS folder so that we can link in for requests that are coming in from the banks.

Thanks

Click start, run, then type in:

\\nahoutrd-dv4\powerdpr2000

This will open up a folder where the data is archived to.  It should be read only, so let me know if there are any problems or you need read/write access.

John

He would definitely be going to clean-up if we start the new company.  If we do not start the new company he would be the first person laid off.  What kind of contract is he under?

Stacey

Stacey wanted to let you know that myself and the rest of the group feel and know that Nick does not want to be here. You could tell during the conference call yesterday with you that he was somewhat disappointed that he was not laid off. He has other avenues that I think he wants to pursue. Wanted to know if we have any recourse on this since he under contract right now. I have not approached him about it but have been tempted to just so he will get his act together. Here is a person who would rather be laid off than continue to work while people have been laid off who do not want to leave. It has rubbed some people the wrong way. 

We are overstaffed currently and we would not lose a step with one less person.

Let me know your thoughts,

John

I have no idea how the contracts are being handled.  If he is that unhappy he should talk to Billy Lemmons (the associate HR rep).

Stacey

Not sure, I think it is just a one year contract.

Here is my request:

Can you make the system calculate a killed deal?  There were deals killed with Sempra Energy Trading on Saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves.  Basically, we need to calc all Sempra deals that were killed Saturday or later as of last night.  Is this possible?

Thanks,
Stacey

The LT-Option book should have a prior day of +226,703.43.  Please include this in the spreadsheet I sent out yesterday.  It is a Constellation deal that was not killed.'

Thanks,
Stacey

No problem.  Do not worry about my previous requests.

Stacey

Dear Stacey and Fran:

  Both of you have asked me to restore some portcalc reports, some of the request was due back to even early this year.  I submitted all those request to the Unix team, but due to what happened to the company recently, apparently things are not kept in track very well and some people who used to work on the restoration has left without leaving a clear status notification.  

  I was asked by the Unix group to put together all the reports that still need to be restored and submit it to them again.  I'm wondering if you can provide me with a current list.   

  I'm very sorry that I have to ask you to do this, but I think by putting together a complete list and getting rid of those we no longer need, we can get things done in the shortest time.

  Thanks a lot.

- Zhiyun

I was comparing the 'Position by Trader PRINT' tab in WestPos to the VaR report (Nov. 26 for example).

I would hope the rules for carrying over a week will still apply, but I have not heard anything concrete.  I'll see what I can find out.

Stacey

Stacey, I have checked the VaR numbers in the DPR against the date specific VaR reports for several days and they tie out. Can you tell me which reports you were looking at.

Any news on running the DPR's? Do you know what happens with unused vacation time?

John

Those are funny.  Work is hectic, can't write much, but hope to find a time that you can come visit.

this covers just about everyone I know.

Unfortunately, the last one did apply to me.  Happy Holidays.  :-)

  . 1. Your potted plants are alive. And you can't smoke a one of them.
    2. Having sex in a twin-sized bed is absurd.
    3. You keep more food than beer in the fridge.
    4. 6:00 AM is when you get up, not when you go to sleep.
    5. You hear your favorite song on an elevator.
    6. You carry an umbrella. You watch the Weather Channel.
    7. Your friends marry and divorce instead of hookup and breakup.
    8. You go from 130 days of vacation time to 7.
    9. Jeans and a sweater no longer qualify as 'dressed up.'
    10. You're the one calling the police because those darn kids next
        door don't know how to turn down the stereo.
    11. Older relatives feel comfortable telling sex jokes around you.
    12. You don't know what time Taco Bell closes anymore.
    13. Your car insurance goes down and your car payments go up.
    14. You feed your dog Science Diet instead of McDonald's.
    15. Sleeping on the couch makes your back hurt.
    16. You no longer take naps from noon to 6 p.m.
    17. Dinner and a movie - The whole date instead of the beginning of one.
    18. Eating a basket of chicken wings at 3 a.m. would severely upset,
        rather than settle, your stomach.
    19. You go to the drugstore for Ibuprofen and antacids, not condoms
        and pregnancy test kits.
    20. A $4.00 bottle of wine is no longer 'pretty good stuff.'
    21. You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast time.
    22. "I just can't drink the way I used to," replaces "I'm never going to
drink that much again."
    23. Over 90% of the time you spend in front of a computer is for real
work.
    24. You don't drink at home to save money before going to a bar.
    25. You read this entire list looking for one sign that doesn't apply to
you.

I think what was happening with the VaR is that we would like the POS with VaR in the evening but not relink in the morning when they run the VaR p/l so the numbers in the pos are a day behind.

One more change....the two desks should be broken down into separate portfolios, so we actually need two new portfolios set up in Enpower:

East Bankruptcy
West Bankruptcy

They should each have their respective bankruptcy book only in each portfolio.

James' birthday party is that Saturday.  Before I knew that I was thinking of going home.

Stacey

Did you Say we had something planned for the  weekend of the 15th in December.

Norman & Zhiyun,

Please see the bottom of this e-mail for the original values given to Andrea for this exercise.  At the time, we had not broken out East & West and only had a total value.  My issue is that the original values do not tie to the values were are seeing today.  Just to be sure, the calcs we are running should include all Sempra deals killed on or after Saturday, Dec. 1.  Can you please advise as to which numbers are correct.

Thanks,
Stacey

East    - ($10,105,808)
West   -  $24,627,341
Total	 $14,521,533

Let me know when you need additional info!

Thanks.
Casey
Is this including east and west? Is there a way to recalc the value of all the Sempra deals killed since Friday as of close of business Friday, and as of close of business Monday?

Give me a call if you want to talk before we do this.

ThankS,

Debbie

Debbie,

Are you comfortable with these numbers, and if you plug them in, what is our final mark?

Dave

David-

Stacey White asked that I provide you with the value of the Sempra deals that were killed.  They are as follows:

Swaps		($8,664,604)
Options		   ($978,825)
Total		($9,643,429)

Please call me if you need any additional information.

Thanks!

Andrea Dahlke

ps-I tried to call your extension to give you the information to give you the information, but was unable to connect to you.

I had forwarded your message to HR and had not heard anything.  However, I just went to yahoo and was reading an article that says the website is careerservices@enron.com but that it is not currently in operation.

Good luck,
Stacey

Stacey,

Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:

career services@enron.com

It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
not accept a blank space.

I tried emailing to
       careerservices@enron.com
       career.services@enron.com
       career_services@enron.com

Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.

Thanks

Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
will be able to call a few people in the morning.

The LT-SW book was not officialized last night.  I have officialized it this morning.  We still need to be careful regarding officializations for credit purposes.

Stacey

Here is today's list.  I have open questions for:

Heidi Mason
Brian Gillis 
Jenny Latham
Michelle Bruce/Todd Hall/Frank Prejean (liquids, coal & weather)
Jeff Gossett
Stacey White
Sheila Glover
Sheri Thomas

You can filter on your name to see which books I have questions on.  

If you can call me or write me an e-mail as to the status of the book(s) (whether it should have been officialized or not), I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks

Shona

 

Will,

If you could attempt the following report I would greatly appreciate it.  I have given a best efforts try in report writer, but because I am pulling MTM value it is pulling every strip.  I need all options by flowing from today forward for the East and West portfolios.  I need deal date, start date, end date, premium, strike price, Monthly/Daily Option indicator, MTM value from AdHoc, Buy/Sell, Counterparty, Enron Entity, Call/Put, Deal Type, Region.

Thanks so much,
Stacey

Call me tomorrow when I can start working - 281-894-0468.

The option query that we ran this morning does not tie back to AdHoc.  I first realized it when I was trying to clean up deals that had many strips.  There were instances where the P&L and delta were not consistent for every strip so I looked in AdHoc to see which number was right and that is when I started noticing inconsistencies.  Could you please query the P&L and Delta for the following deal numbers in spreadsheet.  The only way I have to do this is to query each deal separately in AdHoc.  Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Stacey

Phone numbers where I can be reached:

I have consolidated the changes in the following file:

 

Please change the trade date on all the newly created Bankruptcy Deals to the trade date of the original deal.  Also, please cross-reference in both transactions the associated deals numbers and document that the deal numbers are due to termination.

Also, check with Will Smith to make sure he has completed the Allegheny transfers (they were missed in the initial batch run) and then re-calc the 'Termination Test' portcalcs to ensure that the designated counterparties are not included in the old portfolios.  Also, check with Norman or Zhiyun to ensure that they have attached the port-calc code to the Bankruptcy portfolios and then we need to make test runs on them as well.

Thanks,
Stacey

Can you please work on attaching the portcalc code to the Bankruptcy Portfolios first thing Monday morning.  Please reply to this e-mail when it is complete so we can begin testing the transactions we moved.

Thanks,
Stacey

P.S.  Zhiyun, Thank you so much for the option data.

Stacey

Can you do mine?

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Please ensure that Israel Estrada receives his previous access for IT purposes.  He was mistakenly removed on Friday.

Please split up the following list and change the deal date back to the original deal date.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

I don't.
 
Stacey

Do we have any critical vendors???
 
Let me know.
 
thanks
 
bob

Attached is a template we will be using to identify all pre-petition creditors that are critical to our operations.  This will allow these creditors to be paid.  Payment to such creditors must meet the following criteria in order to be considered "critical":  (1) payments must make sound business and operational sense; (2) payments must be mission critical; and (3) there must not be a substitute vendor.

The "critical" status of these vendors will need to be approved by Kerry and George Wasaff (head of the cash committee).

Jenny, we already have your list. 

Thanks, 
Mike 

<<Critical Vendor Template.xls>> 

   

Call me tomorrow so we can discuss the following:

Employee morale
Terminations with cash already paid
Other terminations to ensure they are not affecting downstream systems
Scheduling cuts

Thanks,
Stacey

Corry,

I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Stacey

We are going to Cuero this weekend so will not be in for Sunday brunch.  Sorry I will miss it.

Hey girls.  I just talked to Kathy and she can't do
lunch on Friday, but wanted to do Sunday brunch

One question:  I had Melissa Murphy put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me.  If a termination date is 12/4/2001, do I move 12/4 forward to the bankrupt book or do I move 12/5 forward to the bankrupt book?
 
Thanks,
Stacey

Thanks Stacey for all the hard work in putting this together- this list is great.  I  met with the East group today and the West group on Tuesday to review.  We may have questions but  .... thanks again.
 
The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.

Elsie, 

I put the 11/30 strip back in the deal.  The "884449 in bankruptcy" does refer to another deal that we created due to Aquila terminating transactions with us.  The reason you cannot see it is because you probably do not have access to the new portfolio.

Stacey

Stacey,
	On deal 321581.1, there were adjustments made 12/10-12/11.   Appears to have deleted 11/30/01 strip.  In deal comments, what does "884449 in bankruptcy" mean?  I tried looking up this deal, but it did not exist.  

Thanks,
Elsie

Thanks

Since we talked about a lot of different spreadsheets, can you give me some more guidance on what was included in the spreadsheet I talked about so I will send you the correct one.

Stacey

Stacey,

Would you please send us trader's position sheet that you mention in our meeting few days ago
Currently, we work on building a prototype for traders.

Regards,
dluu

 

Frank,

Here is the file.  I am planning on continuing to look for the $30.5 MM that is created when you add dailies and compare to YTD.  (Cell M245).  You can delete these information if you want.  Remove December from the reconciliation because I only gave them data through 11/30 and Curve Shift data for December is completely useless.

Yes, you will do normal calculation tonight.  In addition, either today or tomorrow, please also calculate the Bankruptcy Portfolio.  Export data from both West and Bankruptcy Portfolio by Counterparty and Physical/Financial.  Compare the data to the Termination Lists.  All counterparties on the termination list should be included in Bankruptcy Portfolio and all other counterparties should be in the West portfolio.  If you notice discrepencies, please investigate and correct.  Also, Will is still changing some deals that Casey sent him an e-mail on.  Do you know if this affected the West?  If so, you will need to wait until he is complete.

Stacey
Stacey:

It seems like Casey is out of office.  We have done changing the termination dates.  Is there anything we need to do next?  Do we calc our books as we normally do this afternoon?

Thanks,
Fran

Casey:

We have changed the termination date for west deals (old and new) as specified in the "termination dates" file in Stacey's special project folder.  Please let me know how we should proceed from here. 

Thanks,

Due to problems with the gas curves there will be incorrect credit information for TXU, Calpine and Indeck Pepperel Power Assoc. out of EnPower (these counterparties have spread options and/or heat rate swaps that utilize the gas curves.)  If you need these transaction re-calced in the morning please contact Andrea Dahlke and X 5-4080.

The gas curve problems have been solved; therefore, there will be no problems with the following counterparties.

Do your gas books have any gas deals left?  There were 23,000 deals missed in the 'kill exercise' performed by IT.  If you have deals left, please re-calc tomorrow to see if they go away.  If you have no deals, then you are done!

Stacey

Hi Stacey!!

Please confirm since Casey is out. Thanks!!

Sam

Hi Casey!!

Just to confirm, as mentioned below, today is the last day we officialize the gas books. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Sam 

fyi

Hey!  Original plan was for today to be the last day, but gas IT did not run the script correctly last night to kill all of the interdesk trades so tomorrow, hopefully, will be the last day to calc gas.

We'll keep you informed!

Take care of yourself!
Casey

Dear Casey:

John will be out for the rest of this week.  He mentioned yesterday that we might stop calcing the gas books soon.  According to Shona's email (see attached), it seems like we will run/officialize the last gas book calcs today for the last time?  Would you please confirm?  Thanks!

Hope you are doing well,
Fran

Here is today's list.

 << File: dec 11 unofficialized.xls >> 

I have open questions for:

Stacey - 2 west pwr books (by the way, good job on the gas books you guys have - I spoke with Casey and she'll officialize these tonight for the last time and we'll inactivate them tomorrow)
Todd - GRM & weather - do you know when you might be able to start officializing these again?
Michelle/Mark/John S - there are still a few books (exotics etc) that we should figure out what should be done
David Oliver - UK-CRD-BRN-PRC - Mark said this one would be officialized.  It showed up as not officialized this am.
Sheri - the exotic price still isn't being officialized.  Where do we stand on that one?
Matt - steel & lumber - they showed up - we rolled the files from yesterday and uploaded them this morning - is this okay or were there terminations run through?

Thanks

John,

This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas.  Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.

 

Thanks,
Stacey

We technically should have no third party transactions.  If we do, we need to move them to the NG-Price book.  Please let me know if this is the case.  Also, Casey & I will be both be out of the office tomorrow.  If you need someone in Houston to help get questions answered please call Andrea.

Thanks,
Stacey

Stacey,

There are still gas deals in five gas books. So you mean they should all go away tomorrow (whether interdesk or 3rd party deals)?
Anyway, I will re-calc tomorrow to make sure.

Thanks,
Sam

Here is the file I started.  I know there is plenty of missing data because I did not know all the commodities involved with each counterparty.  If you could fill in what you know, that would be a big head start on this heinous project.  I will be out of the office tomorrow.  My cell phone works again so I will be available.

Have a great weekend.

Thanks,
Stacey

Just want to make sure that Tom and Sam will be preparing these documents.
 
Stacey
While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.

To be totally consistent from the beginning, can you rename either your long term Long Names to not include spaces between 'North' and 'West' and 'South' and 'West'.  The short term books do not have spaces.

Stacey

Please note the following changes to traders and what books they will be trading (highlighted in red). There are no longer any management trading books for power or gas. Tracy and John, there will only be one trading book for the st-nw trading area. If there are any issues with this please forward questions to Tim Belden. If there is anyone I have missed on the email that needs this info, please forward it on. To expedite the process for all, Tim Belden will be looking after 2 trading books for the time being. There is no time frame for when a change on this will take place.

Here is a list of the remaining Hourly traders for the West trading region.

Bill Williams

You can go ahead and send it to me as I am sure I will be performing the review at some point.

Thanks,
Stacey

Kristin and Stacey-

I know that we probably won't be performing the UK Power doorsteps, but I did receive the NETA papers that Chris had sent.  Do you all have an interest in getting a copy?  Let me know.  Thanks,

Christy

I was working on getting the right sign-off before I approved or denied.  I should know no later than tomorrow.

Stacey

Could you please check on Request number #70996 for Maria Van Houten? Are we waiting for an approval from someone? I really appreciate this Stacey, talk to you later - Chip

Yeah - are you still going on vacation?

Stacey

I assume you've heard.

Dear Kristin

I think it is safe for you to go ahead and cancel your tickets for the upcoming trip.  I believe it will be moved to Q1.

Regards

Please try contacting him at the following numbers
713-668-7572 (home)

If you cannot contact him at these numbers, let me know, I have one other way of getting in touch with him.

Thanks,
Stacey

Cecilia is asking for the term paperwork and will set up an exit interview to answer his questions.   Please tell him to be on the lookout for an appointment with us today. 
Thanks, H
He was not offered a job in UBS.  He was told last Friday, by me, that he would remain in the Estate, so his resignation is from the Estate.

Stacey

I believe he is a UBS employee.   Jeanie, are you guys handling any terminations yet for these folks or do you want us to process? 
Thanks, 
H
Hector is this your area or Jeanie Slone.

Frank

Stacey,

I'd like to notify you that tomorrow, January 31st, 2002 will be my last day at Enron.  I am resigning to pursue another career opportunity.  It has been good working with you, and I wish you and your team all the best.

Tim Carter

I thought we already told them to exclude those portfolios???

Stacey

I found out where the retail number is coming from. You are picking up an EES West portfolio which is incorrect. That is our test env't only and not in production.

John

Could you tell me where you are getting the retail west numbers from.

John

Please see the power export tab information to see the positions and maturity gap numbers being exported to the DPR.  In case you need to see further detail, I have saved the power bench report under O:Dropbox, PWRB_1025_PWR_V@R_NEW.xls.  I will save the power bench report under the dropbox on a daily basis.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary=
 focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enoug=
h on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to s=
pend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and acc=
urate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also bee=
n a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily =
routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day t=
o day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that=
 Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead =
of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling =
everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business r=
elated issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of respo=
nsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That w=
ay nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went w=
ell otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitte=
d to areas of improvement.

Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the gro=
up. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accoun=
ting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month an=
d secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the re=
ports that we produce are used.

Who was your surgeon for lasik surgery?  Would you recommend?  I am planning on getting surgery next year and have to make my benefit elections to cover.

Thanks,
Stacey

I was not sure if you wanted exposure by asset, liability or absolute value so I provided the top 25 assets and top 25 liabilities.  

Hope this helps.

Stacey  

Can you make sure that your group starts using the new & improved request form.  See m:\common\power\riskmgmt\admin\Requests & Request Templates\Blank Book Request Enpower.xls

Any calc will do.  When testing, please do not write over AdHoc, I need to pull some information from there.

Stacey

Stacey, 
I will be testing it. Do I need to run it with a specific desk's calc? Or any official calc will do?

Thanks,
Sam

There is a report in PortCalc - Hypothetical Curve Shift (Monthly) - that I would like someone to review for accuracy.  It is meant to have price increments that indicate what curve shift would have been had the curve been adjusted by that increment.  In order for this report to be generated, you have to choose the Hypothetical Curve Shift option in PortCalc (see below)
 << OLE Object: PBrush >> 

Please let me know who will be doing this analysis and if you need any help.

Thanks,
Stacey

I hope all is well with you!  Kristin, Mike and I will be arriving in London Saturday, November 3.  We will be there through the next Saturday, leaving early that morning.  Can't wait to see you.  Any exciting news?  How's work, social life, etc.

Stacey

Sorry I haven't responded very timely.  Things have been hectic at work.  I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Russell said you would be in around 6-7, is this right?  What kind of food do you want to eat, Russell suggested a Mexican food place, is this o.k. with you?

Stacey

Hey!  Just wanted to say thanks for the  Birthday Card.  Also, sorry we didn't get to see each other over the  weekend.  I was so excited because I was actually going to be able to give  you Fortune's Rocks back!  Can you believe I finished it?  It only  took me 3 months!  Now I am reading your To Tame a Texan's Heart.  So  maybe I will have it finished by the next time we see each other.
 
Have y'all seen any good movies  lately?  We went for my birthday and saw Don't Say a Word.  Couldn't  decide between that or Training Day.  Should have seen Training Day.   I was disappointed in the other one.  Of course Lamar said "I told you  so".
 
Well, I will let you go.  Take  care.
 
Love,
Karyn

Keith, 

Here are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities. 

Approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.

Thanks,
Stacey  

Thanks

Just the option traders: Harry Arora, Rob Stalford, Steve Wang and Jaime Gualy.

Yes.

Stacey

Thanks Casey. Shouldn't these restrictions apply to all portfolios? (commodity only, and excluding ancillary curves)

Tom,

For East Power, when you do your extract, you should select "commodity" only as the deal category so you will not pick up any capacity positions, as they are included in neither Var nor our position reports.  Also, you should query by delivery point and exclude all of the following delivery points (region codes in parentheses) as they are ancillary and credit positions and not energy positions, per se:

10 Min Spinning (R1J)
10 Min Non-Spinning (R1K)
30 Min Op Reserve (R1L)
Op Cap (R1N)
Renewable Energy Credits (R6R)
Regulation Up (R6W)
Regulation Down (R6X)
Responsive Reserve (R6Y)
Non-Spinning Reserve (R6Z)

Let me know if you have any questions!
Casey

1) RisktRAC
2)Yes, except South America is not in EnPower yet.  The portfolio is set up, but no transactions are captured there.
3) The West looks close but the East is completely off.  Also, AlbertaENA should not be zero.
4) RetailEast & RetailWest are test Portfolios and should not be included!

Stacey
Hi Stacey.

We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --

1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other names I should add?

Thanks.
- Tom

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 

Stacey,

- ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)

- Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.

- For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
We'll take these from RiskTrac.

- For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac

- The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?

Thanks.
-Tom
I was incorrect about Alberta ENA, it should be zero but where is Alberta?  It should have a big position.

(Revision: 5) 

Tim,

I typically do not like to give access to m:\common\power\ directory as this is where all the DPR information is.  A member of your fundamentals team, Maria Van Houton, would like access to the drive in order to access curve data that the risk group puts together.  If this is o.k. with you I will approve, otherwise I will tell her to get the information from the curve directory m:\power2\region.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey,
The raw data is in M:\power2\region, but the files that I actually collect the data from and that are e-mailed to me, are located in the directory I requested access to (M:\common\power\position\dpr\2001\westpos\2001\).
Thanks,
Maria  

The power curves are actually located in M:\power2\region  If you want access to this drive please resubmit request and make sure it is Read Only.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey,
I work in the fundamentals group in Portland and receive the forward power curves daily via e-mail to import them into our database for our traders here.  I have requested access to the m:\common\power directory because this is where the files are stored and it would be much more efficient and increase reliability tremendously by automating the collection of this data versus the current system of manually detaching the files through e-mail.  Our traders have come to rely heavily on accessing this information in our database.  However, when I'm out, the files don't get imported because I'm not here to detach them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Thanks,
Maria

I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes.

I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

Stacey-
The PL Desk report was modified, so I tested it earlier today and everything looked good.  Can you please send an email to Bill Crooks and Karen Y Martin so they can release the new version to production.

Thank you.

J.P.

Please test version 3.0.2.1 of PLDesk that is in Stage.
It shows the Category (cmdty, cpcty) that was missing before.

Let us know if it works good.

Any luck with the PL Desk Report?

J.P.

JP,

I got your message yesterday but I had to re-image my machine at that time.
I will look into it shortly and let you know what's the situation.

Thanks!
Nikolay

Nikolay- 
How did you get the column Deal Cat-Code to show up when you ran the PL Desk Report?  This was the column that separated the lines into Commodity and Capacity.  I don't see that column when I run this report.

J.P.

Sorry I left you off the first distribution.

James,

Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

Stacey

We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?

Thanks,
Stacey

Also in addition can you please confirm that you are not doing the complex derivatives group which is run totally separately in both personnel and risk terms ?

Thanks

Are you here next week then because I am due to be away for some of that time ?

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

Stacey

Maria,

What information are you trying to obtain through m:\common\power?  Sorry for all the questions, but everyone requesting this directory gets them as this directory contains extremely sensitive information.

Thanks,

No formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today.  Instead, I would like for each of you to think of a question(s) or problem(s) that you have encountered while in the group.  These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer.  For those areas that you already know the answer, this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem.  For those areas that you do not the answer, we will do our best to get that answered.  

In addition, if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class, this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds.

Thanks,
Stacey & Casey

Jason,

I am aware of the risk being taken regarding the old Sun machines moving to the new building.  Specifically, they may not work once taken out of commission.  I am also willing to take this risk and request that the current machines the power risk group operates on should accompany them to the new building.

Thanks,
Stacey

o.k.

I thought I would wait until I get a final answer on the trading situation before I send in revisions. It would be easier to do it once rather than several times.

John

Your gas books still have Bob Badeer and Matt Motley attached to them.  You need to send in a change for these books.

Stacey

Here is the latest list , but it could change again.  I have also attached a list of the gas books we have set up. 

LT - NW = MIKE SWERZBIN
LT - SW = MIKE DRISCOLL (pending)
LT - CA = TIM BELDEN
ST - NW = SEAN CRANDALL
ST - NW = DIANA SCHOLTES
ST - CA = CHRIS MALLORY
ST - SW = JEFF RICHTER

 << File: new BOOK REQUEST TAGG.xls >> 

John

Here is an updated New Power Company exposure as of 10-24.  I have included Buy/Sell, Deal Type, and Capacity/Commodity.  Please let me know if there is any other detail you need.

Stacey

  

I really am in the dark re: Hanson.  If you could make the rounds then we might have a better idea if Donnie should be there.  If Scotty does not know all the particulars (and Jeff does) I am not sure that the 9:30 PST meeting will be effective.  I basically just want some answers!

Stacey

I believe Jeff cannot make the meeting tomorrow at 9:30 local. I know we meet at 8:30 local should we have jeff and Scott sit in at 8:30 and just meet separately after? Did you want Donnie at the meeting? Of course I am speculating not knowing anything about whether Scott can make it or not.

I am also sending you a forward of a meeting I am supposed to have with Scotty Gilbert and Jeff Richter tomorrow - hope you can join us.

Stacey

I would like to have a "Face Off" meeting to discuss how we are going to set this deal up and manage the different risk components.

Congratulations US Citizen!

You have to set up a new book (see the other Spreadsheet books for naming convention).  Can't wait to discuss all this.

Stacey
I just want to make sure that all the angles are covered regarding this deal. I know you had mentioned that research signs off on the model, we need to make sure that the positions get picked up in VaR, this needs to get into RiskTrac. What else am I missing?

John

Can you take care of this?

Stacey

Deal Entry needs your user testing today.  The Production freeze starts tomorrow so we have to move this today if it is ok or it cannot be moved for another 2 weeks.
Kroum made some changes so that the long deals done in Canada will not crash the system.  You should not see a change at all.  They had over 2000 transactions that replication could not keep up with, but that has been fixed.
I will be calling you to make sure you are able to test.  I appreciate all your help.
Thank you!

Present preliminary results and discuss strategy for moving forward.

He was not offered a job in UBS.  He was told last Friday, by me, that he would remain in the Estate, so his resignation is from the Estate.

Stacey

I believe he is a UBS employee.   Jeanie, are you guys handling any terminations yet for these folks or do you want us to process?

Stacey,

I'd like to notify you that tomorrow, January 31st, 2002 will be my last day at Enron.  I am resigning to pursue another career opportunity.  It has been good working with you, and I wish you and your team all the best.

Tim Carter

Can you get with Doug and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain?  Also, have you requested from Anita Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C.

Thanks,
Stacey

stacey,

As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

PS Also wondering about the green mountain one...

I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.

Thanks,
Stacey

 << File: East Schedule C LCRA 9-30-00.xls >> 
I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Thanks,

Doug

Just wondered if anyone has noticed any change in EnPower performance?  See e-mail below.

Stacey

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

Steve

There is no attachment.

Stacey

Attached is the ERMS Discounting Memo as of 9/26/01.   

Please note that the 9/26/2001 balance is based on the new method of calculating the discounting amount.  The changes that were made are as followed:

			Old method	New method
Physical contract 	55 days		55 days
Financial contract	55 days		5 days
Financial calendar	55 days		38 days

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks
Anita

No, I just noticed that we hadn't had a staff meeting in a while and next week is month end and the next week I will not be here.  Casey is out on Friday and have back to back meetings tomorrow.  Make your commitment to DHA and we'll update you on the staff meeting.

Stacey

Stacey-

I have a lunch meeting for DHA on Thursday that I committed to be at (and have a report to give).  I definitely do not want to cause problems by not being at this staff meeting that was called for Thursday though.  Would you like me to find someone to take my place at the DHA meeting?

Thanks!

How much money are we talking?  Re: AA, they will need explanation as to the amount.  Georgeanne is typically involved in all Schedule C discussion with them.

Stacey

Are you available?  If not give us 10 minutes this morning to discuss.

We think the best option is to balance the month with a sale/purchase at $R0 price and push the income and cash payment/receipt into the future.  Remi is giving us a Dec 2002 expected settlement date which is discounted at about 25%.

Other than Lavo's approval does there have to been sound rationale for a Schedule C for AA?

Martha

Please plan to attend a meeting in my office (ECno 2328) at 1:45 today.

Britaldo, Peccio & possibly Remi will be calling me @ 2:00 to discuss establishing an official policy for recording trades, receivables and related "reserves" for deals.

Martha, I think this will link back to our discussion last week and the decision to "schedule C" some amount for the liquidity issue.

Thanks,
Jody

Sorry I had to cancel, a meeting was put on my calendar that I cannot miss.

We will begin having weekly download/discussion sessions starting the week after next.  This meeting will be mandatory and you should not send a substitute unless approved by me.  If the day and time do not work with your schedule please let me know so we can coordinate our calendars.

Thanks,
Stacey

Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book (if not, have it reactivated) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID.  John may still be set up in EnPower, I am not sure that his access was ever taken away, but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Stacey

Stacey/TJ:

I need to be setup on EOL with the appropriate book for  SOCO (EPMI-LT-SERC?).  I start on Monday Oct. 29th.

FYI  - we will be running a live simulation on Thursday.  I will give you more details when I know something.

John,
When you get a chance will you ask Tim if he is aware of this?

Stacey

FYI - Meeting is at 0900 (CST) in ECS06716 - Phone number: 713.584.1109

Everyone,

As we prepare to re-launch the website, we're planning a simulation session for our traders and originators for next week (tentatively Monday).  This session will be similar to the ones we had before the initial launch of EnronOnline.  In brief, the goals are:

Test the integrity/functionality of the system and related processes,
Get everyone re-acclimated with the system and processes (traders, originators, credit, operations, help desk, et al), and
Show how the trading system and our processes work to the UBS staff visiting next week.

In order for the simulation to be successful, we will need to ensure that the simulation environment is exactly like the "live" trading environment.  We will need to coordinate with each one of you about what needs to get done to make this possible.  I will be sending out an invite for a meeting tomorrow morning.  Please make sure you attend to discuss what needs to get done on your end (setting up trader/counterparty profiles, credit headroom, etc.), as this simulation has been requested for early next week.  If you have prior commitments, please appoint someone from your group to fill in for you.

Feel free to call me with any questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Go ahead and decline. She is in San Fran but another guy I talked to said she wanted to pull prices from a database source. That is nothing to do with the M drive.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new responsibilities.

The risk group should be able to help you coordinate this request.

Stacey White

Good Morning Stacey,

Jeff Richter wants to start trading ancillary service deals through EOL.  To help facilitate this new business, we need to setup several new pub codes that represent the indexes the California ISO publishes for ancillary services.  A few of the ancillary pub codes are already setup we just need to add the ones for spin & non-spin.  Do you know who we need to get with to have these new pub codes setup?  I will work with the IT guys to ensure the programs that scrape the ISO site and store the prices are updated to capture these new indexes.

Thanks,  David Poston

ps - Please give me a call if you have any questions, 57834

These pub codes already exist:

ISOGRRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLRRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

These pub codes need to be created:

ISOGSRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLSRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD REPLACEMENT RESERVE @ NP-15)

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

ISOGNRNP15	(CAL ISO GENERATION NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15)
ISOLNRNP15	(CAL ISO LOAD NON-SPINNING RESERVE @ NP-15

Repeat for SP-15

Repeat for ZP-26

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Thanks,
Stacey

I just heard a rumor that the Ercot Power Trading was going to sit in the Gas (Open) section.  Is this the case and does it change the seating for gas and power risk?

Thanks,
Stacey

Tom,

Hope this helps.

1)  Only the power positions need to be queried.  Gas positions for spread options and heat rates are included in the gas bench.

2)  Any power Exchange transactions should be included, but the gas transactions calculated in ERMT should not be included as they are on the gas bench.

Thanks,
Stacey
Hi Stacey. Norman had a couple of questions regarding extracting position info from Adhoc. Can you please provide answers to the first 2 below. I wanted to be consistent with how you are reporting your positions in your reports.
Thanks.
- Tom

Dear Tom,

	 1) Are you only interested in the Power positions? Do you need the Gas position for a Spread Option deal? 

	 2)  Do you want only the Post IDs officialized by Power PortCalc, so the Exchange deals' position calculated in ERMT need not be included?

	 3)  Can the results be in vertical format? e.g.

	East	Nov-01		100
	East	Dec-01		200
	...
	West	Nov-01		101
	West	Dec-01		201
	...

	Thanks,

Norman.

Hi Norman. I've tried running some queries using Adhoc and I always get too detailed information. We only need total MONTHLY peak and off-peak positions for a couple of portfolios.

I've attached a file to illustrate the information we need. Can you please take a quick look and let me know if it would be possible to write a query to generate the info on a daily basis. Since the query may take a while to run, and we need the info by 7:00AM everyday, I would prefer to automatically run the query at say 5AM?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.
- Tom

 << File: Power positions.xls >> 

Cost Center 103823 should have 6% allocated to West Power (not 13%) and 94% allocated to East Power.

Thanks,
Stacey

please review the percent for your cost centers.

Let me know of any changes.

thanks

bob

Is this the Energy Ops schedule you are referring to?

Edie,

Per our conversation last night, attached is the lowest level of detail we can provide for EOPS allocations to EA.  EOPS doesn't track these costs at the cost center level.  If you would like for us to provide the plan at a lower level than this, please review the categories and provide us with a further allocation and I will use your allocations on the template for Thursday.  If we can't make it by Thursday, we can provide this level and maybe later we can go back and do a further breakdown.  If you have any questions, please call.

One more thing, this file has not been finalized or blessed so it is preliminary and subject to change.  It should give you a good basis to start breaking it out.

Thanks,

Stacey and Martha,
Any comments on the attached proposal?
Thanks, Sheila

Clara and I met with Pushkar on Friday.  Take a look at the Proposal discussion and let us know your thoughts.

We are basically suggesting that we treat the front two years as MTM via all normal processes and the back years as a different process.

Thanks. Sheila

 

Stacey and Martha,
This outlines our discussion yesterday between Stacey, Clara and myself.
I have given to Pushkar today.  We will discuss with him and set  up a meeting next week.

Casey,

Can you remind me of all this?

Thanks,
Stacey

John,

Good questions, when I figure it out I will add to the Month End Procedures.

Stacey

Just as confirmation, is the last pwrdpr for the month dated as the last business day or the day of the calculation? Also, do we export for the last business day or the effective date?

John

In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.

Power Month End Calculation Procedures

?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

 << OLE Object: Paintbrush Picture >> 

Tanya,

Kim mentioned to me that legal wanted by delivery point and financial/physical broken out, so here is an update.  Numbers are still as of 10/18/2001.

Stacey

  

Actually, I believe we got a hold of Kori and Erol last month before they officialized and they did it correctly.

Stacey

Oh yeah....I bet this is going to go well.  Thanks for at least trying to head this off,  before the issues begin.  

In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.

That is fine.  She doesn't really care about the Schedule C stuff, she just wants to know that is going to come off of LTD.
 
Stacey

Agreed. I told Chris that we aren't doing anything until Tim talks to John. So do I just let Tracy know that we are taking the money and that we are taking it to Sch C?
 
John

As long as Tim has conversations with Lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting, we should be fine.
 
Stacey

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

John,
 
I'm afraid I don't have a whole lot of detail.   These deals originally came through on the March Flash to Actual report as a West DPR adjustment.   I was then told by Stacey that these deals needed to be moved off DPR adjusment, but I'm not sure where they were to be moved to.   You will see these listed as a "?" on the LTD report at the top of the page.  I know during the meeting, Stacey was talking to Portland about these, but the only notes that I see on my hard copy is "wait 60 days on PX"..."annuity 4 sale back to them".
 
Sorry I'm not much more help than that.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
Tracy
 

Can you give me some background info on these deals below. 
 
John
Can both of you give me some background on the 4 annuity deals listed below. Mark, these deals have never shown up on a desk analysis report and were entered on Mar 30 for jan business. Are they supposed to? Murray, are we supposed to be taking these annuities as PMA adjustments or are we still waiting for something more information?
 
 
Thanks for your help on this.

Do you remember what was going to happen to these deals with the cap of 150.00? Will they be clearing anytime soon?

As long as Tim has conversations with Lavo and we get adequate documentation to share with accounting, we should be fine.
 
Stacey

Thanks Tracy. Based on conversations I just had with Chris Foster it looks like they want to take the money and put it in a sch C. To cut a long story short, they are worried that they will lose part or all of this money because the FERC and California may be revising the PX index. I have indicated that this can not be done until John Lavorato signs off on this. Stacey, do you see any fall out from doing this. It looks like they want to take care of this in the next couple of days.

I don't know where all those pictures are.  We received them online, so I am sure they are lost.  Donnie may have them.  Remember, he was dressed as Austin Powers.

Stacey

This reminded me of the year we got the email picture from the West group when they were dressed up for halloween. Do you know if that is still floating around anywhere?

It's not as detailed as you may be thinking. 

We run an unofficial adhoc book for the LT-SW and LT-Options book with option sensitivity checked as on
Run the West_Sens_new macro created by Min and Zhiyun after calc has finished
Spreadsheet is sent to Matt for his use
audience is Matt Motley and Mike Driscoll
Matt only looks at the spreadsheet based on current market conditions and does not do any type of stress testing. As a result we always make sure there are no scenarios in the predictive option sensitivity area..

John

John,

Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

Thanks,
Stacey

Your gas books still have Bob Badeer and Matt Motley attached to them.  You need to send in a change for these books.

Stacey

Here is the latest list , but it could change again.  I have also attached a list of the gas books we have set up.

Ladies,
A new version of Deal Entry with a change for Australia has been moved to stage.  I have gotten concurrence from the West (Kate Symes) stating that it is ok.  I need to insure that on our side no changes have been made that impact you.  Will you please test version 3.0.0.210 at your earliest convenience to verify that.

Partnership
Spurs Enron
Equity Cut
---
Vehicle Is Connected
To Financial Officer
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller

10/18/2001 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page C1 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Enron Corp. shrank its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as the company decided to repurchase 55 million of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron didn't disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a $1.01 billion charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a $618 million loss. But the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity has dropped to $9.5 billion, the company said. 
In an interview Tuesday, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said that about $35 million of the $1.01 billion charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Mr. Fastow. In a conference call yesterday with investors, Mr. Lay said that the 55 million shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company "unwound" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 million. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a "structured finance vehicle" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Mr. Causey didn't elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
In addition, Enron was receiving increasing criticism from analysts and major shareholders concerning the apparent conflict of interest involving the role of its chief financial officer in the partnership, from which he stood to make millions of dollars. In July, Mr. Fastow formally severed his connections to LJM. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, "the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this," Mr. Causey said. 
Enron downplayed the significance of the share-reduction exercise. Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described it "as just a balance-sheet issue" and therefore wasn't deemed "material" for disclosure purposes. 
Jeff Dietret, an analyst for Simmons & Co. in Houston, said that a large reduction of equity could be "a flag for the rating agencies" because it could adversely affect a company's debt-to-equity ratio. Enron said yesterday that as a result of the equity reduction, its debt-to-equity ratio rose to 50% from 46% previously. 
On Tuesday, after Enron reported its big quarterly loss, Moody's Investors Service Inc. put Enron's long-term debt on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's said the move was related to "significant write-downs and charges reflecting substantially reduced valuations" in several of Enron's businesses. In recent years, Enron had moved aggressively into broadband telecommunications and the water business, both of which failed to produce expected returns. 
Enron, which as of June 30 had $33.6 billion in current liabilities and long-term debt, has lately been attempting to shed assets to pay down debt.

Thank you!

Ramesh,

Do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of September as 9/28 instead of 9/30?

Stacey

Can you send me (or tell me where to access) the matrix put together which defines the legal entity for each desk.  Debbie Brackett informed me that the entities are not necessarily the 'legal' entity but something else and I need to help get to the bottom of this.

Thanks,
Stacey

Thank you so much for the invite.  Just found this week I have to go to London for work and will be leaving on Nov. 2.  Have a wonderful time!!

Stacey

The World Wide RibFest "celebration of the Rib" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"
			          I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."	
		               She replies:	"No." 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing "personal reasons"

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Zhiyun,

Let's go ahead and make this change.  We can think of no reason why this would cause a problem.  If everyone could keep a close eye on this deal after the change, that will be most beneficial.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey:

  Just want to follow up to see if there is any after thought about what we discussed yesterday on Index Option.  From our discussion, index option will be reported in two records:  reported as physical in the delivery region, and financial in the index region with the corresponding position and risks.    This seems to be a better alternative than reporting the collapsed position in the delivery region in one record or reporting both position as physical  in two records in the delivery and index region.  

   Could you please let me know if we should go ahead  implementing the changes?  We plan to move the current stage to production tonight and do a new stage release this week, I'd like this change, if going to occur, to go into this release.

   Thanks a lot.

- Zhiyun

  

Ramesh,

Do you still have a list of users who calculated their books at the end of September as 9/28 instead of 9/30?

Stacey

I cannot think of anything that would cause this to be incorrect.  Please let me know if you agree and I will bless the change.

Thanks,
Stacey

Which ancillary curves are you referring to?  Dana and Doug mark the Northeast and Ercot ancillaries and we do not have ancillaries for every curve.

Stacey

I'm trying to get ancillaries into VAR.  Do you agree with synopsis?
Thanks
Frank

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them. 

Jaesoo plans to talk to the trader and come up with more concrete suggestions.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

Tanya

Your thoughts

Frank, Matthew -- we could use some suggestion -- we were asked to set up the ancillary power curves below for West Power. Can you please provide guidance on how these curves should be set up in RiskTrac (primary? jump? etc.). Thanks in advance.
- Tom

Susan, I am so sorry I am doing this. The more I looked at the request again, the more I thought that I should be as specific as possible with it so we can get it right the first time. Any questions let me know.

John

Susan, Please note the name changes to the curves highlighted in Yellow.

John

 << File: new curve request.xls >> 

yes

Stacey, talked to Tim and all traders can trade all regions. So Mike Swerzbin's trading book is NW but he can trade anywhere in CA or SW. Does that answer your question?

John

Also, will you get Tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Just a reminder to make sure you get Tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded.  We need to change trader names etc. so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible.

Stacey

John,

Are you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for Matt Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.

Thanks,
Stacey

Casey should be contacting you to set up a time to talk.
 
Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey!
I wanted to thank you for spending time with me yesterday.
I am very interested in learning more about/ pursuing opportunities within your group.
Since i would have to pretty much start from scratch, wherever you have a need i would be glad to jump in.
Both the curve validation & risk positions sound very interesting to me.
Below is my availablilty over the next 2 weeks...
Please let me know who you'd like for me to sit with/ learn from/ etc. and i will be there.
 
Friday, 10/19- OFF
Monday, 10/22- available all day
Tuesday, 10/23- not available
Wednesday, 10/24- available after 9:30
Thursday & Friday, 10/24-5- available all day
Monday & Tuesday, 10/29-30- available all day
 
I will be off the 31st through the 2nd, as we are now moving (as of 4:30 yesterday!) to the green glass building behind my current unit.
We got a great deal, and saved a bunch of $$$$, so i took it.
 
Let me know what works for you...
 
Thanks!
 
Sunjay
 

Nick,

I would like 3 red poinsettias.

Thanks,
Stacey

The Bayou City Dance Company is once again selling poinsettias as a fundraiser.  This is the dance company for 10-18 year olds for which my wife, April, is the Director.  They are selling the poinsettias for $8.50 each and they are pretty good size (about 12-18 inches tall from what I remember).  Just like last year, I will deliver the flowers to the Enron building (or at least to the Enron garage).

They come in red, white, or pink, but I think the red were by far the healthiest and longest lasting.

The order are due by next Friday, so please let me know if you would like to order (and how many).

Thanks.

SLACKER!!!

For our morning meeting.

 

I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.

Thanks,
Stacey

 
I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.

Trust you are well.

Just wanted you to see this correspondence.

Stacey

I can easily put in prices for the earlier months.  My only worry is that it may affect EES since they have current Ontario positions that should not be valued against my curve (they should use regulated rates until market opening).

I can put the prices in today.
Garrett

Garrett,
Recognizing that Ontario does not open until Mar 02, and recognizing that we have positions starting then, and recognizing that the curve doesn't have prices posted for reference dates prior to Mar 02, the value-at-risk engine is getting errors in it's simulations due to lack of prices thereof.  

Can you do either of the below?
?	Post prices for dates up to Mar 02?  (realize their isn't market?.tough issue)
o	If you post a price, I'm not sure it will mean much other than letting VAR run, primarily because there isn't position prior to Mar 02. Perhaps you can fill in hole with a realistic price so prompt month correlations don't go wacko?I guess.. Stacey help. 
?	Recommend a "like" curve to map R20 to so that we can get around zero price issues?  Realize that mapping will include entire term structure and not just for the reference dates with zero price.
?	Other ideas?

I appreciate your help in working toward a solution.

Thanks,
Frank

There were some conversations regarding getting the Index Option into RisktRAC.  It may be that they are not there yet.  Zhiyun was working with the RAC IT, she would know the latest.

Stacey

Stacey, the index option is showing just as a physical deal with a position. I am wondering if this is creating positions in Risk Trac because our peak position does not tie with the bench mark. The difference is close to the index option but not quite.

I'm trying to get ancillaries into VAR.  Do you agree with synopsis?

Hi Frank.

Rakesh and I talked with Narshima Mistra, ancillary trader at EES.  The ancillary curve exists almost every power curve and it's more related to the capacity availability rather than market prices. Obviously it's indirectly related to prices since cost of generation, which is one important factor of constraints in the capacity of generation.  So EES has a table of ancillary service price % to generation cost.(Below)  I think this table can be used to simulate the ancillary prices by mapping to regional curves after the modification based on the market prices.  The problem is the illiquidity of this market. The price is reported once in a month as average point, so the RAC should identify the risk in this market, e.g. is it reasonable to get the daily value at risk.  Once again, as long as the daily prices of the ancillary is given, the implementation will be available by doing analysis on the data and making table like below to use in mapping curves.

Frank,
the ancillary curves data are not liquid so we can not assign them as primary curves presently.
Using jumps would be appropriate for them. 

Jaesoo plans to talk to the trader and come up with more concrete suggestions.

How urgent is it to start calculating VAR on them?

Tanya

Your thoughts

Frank, Matthew -- we could use some suggestion -- we were asked to set up the ancillary power curves below for West Power. Can you please provide guidance on how these curves should be set up in RiskTrac (primary? jump? etc.). Thanks in advance.
- Tom

Susan, I am so sorry I am doing this. The more I looked at the request again, the more I thought that I should be as specific as possible with it so we can get it right the first time. Any questions let me know.

Are you still attending these meetings?

Stacey

Let me know if this does not work.  This is a report straight from the calculation engine so it is easy and fast to generate.

Stacey

          

Let's wait until we all meet so we don't piecemeal the data to you, but you are correct in your assumption about transmission for the East.

Stacey

Hi Stacey:

  Thanks for the background and insight information.  

  For weekly options, if there is any, we are still using the monthly-daily blending formula, there's no different blending rules applied right now.  

  From your email, I get it that for all deal types in East portfolio, no blending should be applied, this includes deals whose expiry frequency is embedded in the deal type but not explicitly specified (such as transmission deals) in deal entry.  If this understanding is correct, we'll need to make code changes, please let us know if we should start implementing that or wait till after the meeting.

  Thanks,
  
- Zhiyun

The blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  

	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.

	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.

	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.

	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.

Stacey

Just wanted to make sure that you are in agreement with the fact that the items at the bottom still use blending......let me know what you think!

Clarification 1,  I haven't come to East Power last March.  Therefore, the change must not be my request.
Clarification 2,  I like the change.
Clarification 3,  I do NOT have concerns about the difference itself, but it is scary that people (i.e., myself) don't know the difference exits.  I think your summary below is very valuable and I would like to make sure Risk team and other relevant people be aware of it.

Thanks
Hai

Hi Hai:

  Here's the logic about volatility.  Originally all volality is calculated as a blend of monthly and daily volatility.  From last March, based on your request, I made the changes for East and its mirrored portfolios (ENAWEATHER, ENACCO,PLANT,SVCE) only, and for option, spread and basis option only, that we use daily vol for daily option and monthly vol for monthly option.    The implication of that is that for 

1. other portfolios,
2. other deal types such as Asian, Transmission Deal, index option ( which East does not have right now),
3. other expiry frequency, say, WEEKLY (which East does not have right now), or deals that doesn't have expiry frequency explicitly defined,

the blend approach will still be applied.  Please let us know if you have any concerns.

- Zhiyun

Sounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  

I have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in Houston.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.

I have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.  If you don't mind, ask Tim if he has made any decisions on the video conferencing.

Stacey

Just wanted to give you an FYI on a couple of things. I am planning to meet with everybody on a one on one basis in the next week to do a quarterly review. I was planning to revisit their mid year reviews and talk about how they have progressed or not, projects they have worked on and how they went,  long term plans, etc. I think it is even more pressing for Heather because of the way the Renewables was handled. I figured since I went through the process with Emissions, I had a pretty good insight on what I wanted her to do, so I laid out the groundwork for her. Didn't go as I had planned so I wanted to use the opportunity to get her back on track.

Regarding coming to Houston a little more often, I would like to try and come maybe every 4 - 6 weeks if that doesn't blow your budget up. Obviously it depends on ticket prices, but I am learning that while it is ok to communicate over the phone with various groups, it doesn't beat being face to face and looking at the same reports and interacting a little more efficiently. As I said, I was only in the office for 2 days but I could have spent a week there getting work done and meeting with people. It would also give me a chance to meet with Jill Vogelfang a little more. I met with her, last Thursday and it was a good meeting.

By the way, have you heard any more about the PC video conferencing?

	Question re: Jeff Richter

Stacey

Richter reserved that last year.  He made the money.  It's his.  It goes against refund risk in California.  If we take a hit in CA due to refunds, Richter should eat a good chunk of that hit -- if there is extra money then he should keep it.

John has asked me to do a thorough review of our Schedule C reserves in light of the northwest refund decision, BPA's new contracts that started in October, and the overall lower price environment.  Richter's reserves will be a part of this bigger effort that I will get done this week.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Lavorato is asking why Jeff Richter still has $25MM of reserve associated to him since he has moved to EES?  How would you like me to handle this question?

Thanks,
Stacey

Can you take a look at this report for the West and make sure it is correct.

We will be having a staff meeting today.  If we can start at 12:15 rather than 12:00 that would be great because I have an 11:00 meeting.

John,
What is the phone number where we can reach you?

Sorry I do not have an itinerary.  I would like to go over Doorstep findings and anything else you would like to fill me in on since we have not met in a while.

Can you let them know you will be doing this.

Hello all,
This notice is specifically for our Houston based EnPower Day to Day users.  The Day to Day team will be testing apps on the Power Trading Floor (6th Floor) in Enron Center South on Thursday, October 19, 2001.  Our current plans are to begin testing at 10:00 AM culminating at 12 Noon.  If any of you who have a desire to do any testing in the new building, please send an email to either me, or Bill Crooks.  Your coordination efforts should be finalized with Julie Hacker, X5-7895.

I agree with this request.

Please inactivate LT-EPGC-NA (book's related CPID )  and we will inactivate the book in RisktRAC.

Thank you.

J.P.

CPID is counterparty ID.  Each trading book is assigned a CPID so that a book can be associated with each deal entry.

NH

What is CPID?

J.P.:

When you say inactivate are you requesting that the book's related CPID be inactivated or are you requesting that the RisktRAC book be inactivated.  If you are referring to the RisktRAC, you can inactivate the book on the Website.  If you requesting the CPID inactivation that will please reply and  CC Stacey White to insure Supervisor agreement.

Regards

Nancy

Please inactivate LT-EPGC-NA.  

Thank you,

J.P.

When you get around to setting up these fields for the West, please use the portfolio code 'W' for West and then use the same methodology for Book Code that Andrea did.  I'll let you know the answer she gets from Andrew re: 'US Power East' because you should be using 'US Power West'.

Stacey

Andrew-

I have created a draft of our RisktRAC book setup spreadsheet for East Power.  Can you take a look at it and see if everything is accurate.  One issue I have relates to the 'Trading Location' field.  We had previously used 'US Power East', but this is not part of the dropdown menu in the field.  Has this location been changed to something else?

Thanks!

Andrea

 

yes

Are you okay with this?

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Wei

Have you heard any more regarding the PGE sale? It's funny, here nobody is talking about it. I guess that means that it's no big deal here, but you think they would have send something.

It was wonderful.  Not so excited to be back - I'm sure it will get better as the week goes on.  How was your flight?  Did you feel safer?  They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November, so I was just wondering.
 
Stacey

I forwarded to Murray to get some back ground info. These deals don't show up in flash or any desk analysis reports either.
 
How was the week off?
 
John

Can you check into this?

Stacey
 
Do you remember what was going to happen to these deals with the cap of 150.00? Will they be clearing anytime soon? 
 
Thanks
Tracy

Dear Stacey,

	Wei's email is about how to capture Power PortCalc positions and P&L into the RiskTrac ( VATR) system. Both Spread Option and Index-Option's positions are stored in two columns in the VATR result table, whereas an Option deal would be in one column only, so Wei has to treat Index-Option the same as Spread Option in capturing the numbers.
	
	Regards,

Norman.

I understand all the following except the Index-Option.  Why would it be treated as a Spread-Option?

Stacey

Are you okay with this?

Frank,

We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.

Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.

Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.

I am going to make the changes tomorrow.

Regards,

Wei

Thank you!

Stacey

yes, this was a non-DPR flash item

Where did she get this information?  Is it a below the line adjustment (not in the DPR)?

Stacey

Per Louise, the $1.1MM loss on sale was flashed and booked to Presto.

That is Presto's.

12874

What PC did you hit

Trey - Where did the $1.1MM New Albany loss end up?  I booked it to the management summary pc that you gave me, but I didn't know if it got reclassed to Presto or not.  thanks!

Theresa,
Can you find out where the loss was booked?

What is the latest on this?

Stacey

Stacey,

Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 

Do we need to get together to discuss this?

Yes, she is actually down here right now and I am showing it to her.  Send me your names and I'll print them in color for her.

Stacey

Should we have Sonia do this for this move?
Jeff, please ask your assistant to enter all data but not to submit the churn.  The only thing that would change is the final location for that person.  

Thanks a million for the quick turnaround!
Tammy

Tammy -

With gas risk names in.   << File: _6th floorplan 01 301.xls >> 

Do we need to have our assistant put in churn requests,  or wait until this is all settled?

Attached are the excel floor plans with this morning's information.  Please utilize these as a working tool to put names on seats.  Hopefully Presto and Lavorato will not make major changes to the layout.  

Operations on the 6th floor are between 401 and 494.

Please phone me with any questions.

Come Celebrate Jeff's 30th  Birthday!!!
 
 
Will and I are planning a  little get together for Jeff's birthday - here are the  details:
 
 
 
When:      Monday October 15th  
Time:        6:30  pm 
Place:       Goode Company Barbque -  on Kirby  
 
 
 
Come join us on Monday night to  celebrate Jeff's 30th birthday (he actually turns 30 on the 13th, but we will be  in College Station).  We will be at Goode Company most of the evening so if  you can stop by for a beer with the birthday boy.  I know he would love to  see all of you.
 
Please email me back and let me know  if you can stop by - and feel free to forward this on to anyone I may have left  off.
 
See you Monday,
 
Deanna and Will
 
 

Wasn't sure if you had gotten this answered, but there is really no reason that should want to see this.

Stacey

Should RAC have access to the Trading Track reports on the website, or does it matter?

Chris

Sounds good, I will abide.

Stacey

After my recent budgeting experience, I think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count.

When filling vacancies, I would like to have each of you review the positions.  I think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible.  I would like to sign off on all replacements.  I promise not to be difficult.

When adding personnel over your current budgeted number, besides having the commercial team sign-off on the addition, I am think
that it may have to be approved by the COO of Americas (Louise).  I am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes (asset management deals or service arrangements)

Let me know what you think.

thanks

bob

What is the latest on this?

Stacey

Stacey,

Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 

Do we need to get together to discuss this?

Have them go through accounting.  This is non-trading expenses.  Not our area unless it runs through the DPR.

Stacey

Stacey:

Jennifer from AA is inquiring about the $7.5 MM she saw on ENA 3rd Quarter 2001 Detail of Expenses.  She noticed that these expenses are related to trading (Belden)- legal & bank fees.  

Tim is in Houston for the rest of the week and will be back next Monday.  Should I suggest AA to check with Accounting (Tracy Greene) on this item or should I try to contact Tim directly?

Please advise.  

Thank you,
Fran 

Fran,

The $7.5 million is depicted on the ENA 3rd Quarter 2001 Detail of
Expenses.  We received this schedule in conjunction with the Management
Summary.

Thanks for your help.
Jennifer

Jennifer:

1. The Mid Market Originations are calculated based on the total QTD P&L
of our certain books mutplied by certain percentages (different by book)
agreed upon by Tim Belden and Chris Foster early this year.  Therefore
essentially the $14.9 MM P&L is calculated based on every deal in our
LTSW, LTNW, LTCA, LTWMGMT, STSW, STNW, and STCA books.  Please let me
know if you need the agreed percentages for each book.

2. Please advise where you saw the $7.5 MM bank and legal expenses.

Thanks,

Fran
503.464.7973

Fran,

In reviewing the Management Summary, we had the following questions:

1.  We noted that $14.8 million P&L related to Middle Market
Originations
(Foster).  Does this relate to a specific deal or several small deals?
2.  We noted that $7.5 million direct expenses related to trading
(Belden)-
legal and bank fees.  What do these expenses relate to?

If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.  As earnings
release
is quickly approaching, we would appreciate your prompt assistance.

Thank you,
Jennifer

Dave,
 
Can you please approve or reject Samantha's request.  If you are not comfortable approving it, then reject it so she can resubmit.  When I went into the system today, it said it had already been assigned to you.
 
Stacey
Stacey,
 
So do I need to re-submit the request then? Thanks.
 
Sam

You can put John as your primary and me as  your secondary.
 
Stacey

Hi Dave, 

Yes, you are right, I just changed that intentionally in the second request, just to hope that the request doesn't go to you before it got approved by her. It seems like this still went to you even before she approved it.

Stacey, 

So should I have put you or Dave as the primary approver for my request? 

Thanks, 
Samantha 

Samantha, 

Looks like this one went to Stacey, with me as her backup. 
You might want to ask Stacey who should be primary/secondary approver for your requests.

Wasn't sure if you had heard anything about Donnie testing for EES and EnPower.  I am not sure there is anything we need to do, just wanted to keep you in the loop.
 
Stacey

I have put the following test deals in the PWRTESTP environment.  Everything on my side looks good.  The secondary legal entity is populating in all cases and the entry is correct.

666068.01  Deal Blotter 
666069.01  Deal Blotter 
666070.01  Deal Blotter 
666153.01  Deal Entry 
666154.01  Deal Entry Swap   This is also a case where EES is the primary and EPMI is the secondary.  This should not occur but I wanted to test whether it would work if a deal were entered.

666156.01  Deal Entry 
666157.01  Deal Entry 

Please test the effects on your downstream systems, as well as forward this e-mail to anyone I have forgot.  Also e-mail me back at your earliest convenience to give me a status report from your area.

I don't really like what they are suggesting either.  We'll talk Monday.  Besides, they(we) would have to get AA to sign off on half MTM half something else.
 
Stacey

Stacey, 

I think the idea of having two books stinks.  We would have to touch every deal every month to move the "prompt" long term month into the short term book.  (Ok - we only have five long term deals right now but ...)  Maybe I'm over reacting.  Do you know of any other instances where this is done to account for risks?

I think a better idea would be to continue with one book using one curve - Pushkar's front end and our curve 3+ years.  We keep the Rho & Drift from this book.

The SA traders could then execute trades with Pushkar to hedge our short term exposure.  They could tell us the P/L to report and in theory this would be the offset to

the short term Rho in the power book.  

Martha 

Stacey and Martha, 

Clara and I met with Pushkar on Friday.  Take a look at the Proposal discussion and let us know your thoughts. 

We are basically suggesting that we treat the front two years as MTM via all normal processes and the back years as a different process.

Thanks. Sheila 

<<Brazilian IR curve.doc>> 

Stacey and Martha, 
This outlines our discussion yesterday between Stacey, Clara and myself. 
I have given to Pushkar today.  We will discuss with him and set  up a meeting next week.

East Delivery Points for Facilities

just an fyi....

Kim,

I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the west.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
Thanks!
Casey

 

 

Let me know what other detail you need.

Stacey

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Thanks,
Stacey

As you can see from various e-mails, Samantha will need to take responsibility for these twice weekly calcs.  I talked to Bob yesterday and he is aware that she is there and needing something to do.  Unofficially, he said that there should be no employee changes before the end of February, so Sam should start coming to work and taking over any specific West Estate requests.

Stacey

We will be explaining the process to Tom Chapman for the East and Samantha Law for the West.
 
Stacey

yes,  can you tell me who would be the best.
 
thanks
 
bob

 
Bob,
 
What is the plan for this going forward?  I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this, I am correct?
 
Stacey
As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.
 
Chris
 
Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Also, will you get Tim to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Just a reminder to make sure you get Tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded.  We need to change trader names etc. so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible.

Stacey

You will be extremely missed!  Good luck in all your future ventures.

Stacey

Dear Everyone:

  As some of you might have heard, I gave my one-week notification last Friday, my last day with Enron will be Thursday, 1/31.  The reason of my leaving is purely visa status, I have nothing but joy working with you all in the last one and half years,  the wonderful experience made the departure a painful decision.

  I shall be around in the next few days should you need anything from me.  I'd like to thank you all for making my work at Enron such a thrill experience, for your support and friendship, I hope I will have a chance and honor to work with you again in the future.

  Good luck to all of us!

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Casey

Casey,
 
Please provide us with the trader names who will be managing the locations on the bottom of this email.  Once we receive this information, we will be applying the names and testing the products.  If there are more than one trader per location due to the term of the trade, please let us know what that breakout will be.  Thank you.
 
Kevin
Casey Evans has all of this.

As you finalize the personnel issues, any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful.  The reason for this is because we must apply the trader to the appropriate product(s) in order to test the system completely.  Using the information you provide, we will be able to make sure the traders are set up correctly prior to our go-live date.
 
Kevin

I don't have this finalized yet until final personnel decisions are done.

Kevin, 

Please identify which trader will be managing the locations you have listed below so we can have the system fully tested as soon as possible.  I understand that we will be using peak and off-peak only for the locations below.  We will work with the trader of the Ontario location and Leslie Hansen to develop this location, as we do not have anything in the system for this yet.  Thanks, in advance, for your response.

Kevin 

Please ensure products are set up accordingly. 

Thanks, 

Dave 
The UBSW Energy on-line products should be limited to the locations below through 2003 only.   Off-Peak markets will be only in NY, PJM, NEPOOL, and ERCOT.

What is the plan for this going forward?  I am expecting that you will want to use my risk estate employees for this, I am correct?

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Just a reminder to make sure you get Tim a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded.  We need to change trader names etc. so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible.

Stacey

Sounds good to me.  FYI - the option true-up was a different issue, related to the way options were being input into the system.  They had days which would fall out of the calc, not a last day of the month problem.

Stacey

What do you guys think about this.....assuming we can put a fix in port calc that will allow us to true-up the current day (correctly), we could simply recalc the books the following morning (after last day of month) after indeces have been posted, then adjust the financial numbers in the vlookup according to the new top pages?!   

Since 99% of the deals that we did in Calgary were financial, one of the biggest problems we encountered was the last day of true ups at month end. Because we cannot capture the last day of the month right now, as the volume of financial deals grow (assuming it will), it is possible we could be dealing with fairly large PMA adjustments. 

We may need to start thinking about a way that we could capture these numbers.

John

Dear Stacey,

The person should be in Roberto Deleon term (X58824).

Thanks!

Min Zheng

Who do we ask to set up the m:\common?  This makes the most sense to me.

Stacey

Dear All,

In Enron system, M:\common\power is one of our major folder. In UBS system, it is changed to M:\power. I wonder whether we need to create a new folder:
M:\common, then move M:\power under M:\common\ and become M:\common\power just as Enron system. Otherwise, we at least need to spent a lot of time to find out and change all path pointers and fixed links of Excel application under power folder. Also, if too many files dynamic links are  messed up, we may be able to ask system team to rebuild power folder for us.

Thanks!

Min Zheng

I think your resume looks good.  Brad called me today and they are definitely pulling together resumes.  He says send a resume, call or both.

Stacey

Actually, it would be me.  Mike Mott, our Controller, has not started
considering candidates yet but I'm leading the recruiting effort once he's
ready to go.  Is this person willing to send her resume to me?  I'd gladly
take her call as well.

Can you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening
previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at Enron, my first boss,
who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave
Houston if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a
management position, her resume should speak for itself.

Let me know.

Stacey

Power December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.

Also, power books are set up as you have defined below.

Stacey

Do y'all know when the books will be final for December - I had hopes of being able to utilize the people going to UBS, so if you can give me a status I would appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks

Will be there.

Can you join me in the 4:00 pm meeting on Tuesday?  --Sally 

All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

Tammy

Thanks for the reminder.  Just an FYI - it is not babysitting when it is your own kids.  (Just kidding - wanting to share a pet peeve of my sister's.)

I am not sure if I said or not that I would be out Tues. Jess has a series of doctor appointments (due to family history) tomorrow so I will be babysitting. Don't think I will be missing anything with it being so slow.

Can you send me Kim's email - so we can add her to  the list of subs for Bunko!
 
 
Dee

Thanks for the update.  I finally talked to him also.  The message you just told me, is what I communicated to Samantha.  Whenever or if ever, you find out more specifics re: Portland estate, please let me know.
 
Stacey

Talked to Tim last night - basically, they were either letting people know by phone yesterday or in person today.  They were going to let them know they had a position with the estate and leave it up to them as to whether or not they wanted to come in over the next few days.  Tim wasn't exactly sure the reporting relationship and/or what they would be doing, but felt that everyone would have a role at least in the short-term.  I believe that Wednesday is the day that UBS will be in Portland to do benefits review and UBS overview......
 
Sorry I can't be more specific!

I have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.
 
I have all of Heather's information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.  Also, please let me know the message you are sending to 'estate' employees in Portland.  I would like to communicate the same message to Samantha.

The people on the list for VM should be: 

Scotty Gilbert 
Eugene Lee 
Donna Sheidun 
Heather Dunton 

Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.

Tim 

Sounds good to me.  The only days I don't want to meet are the 4th and 5th.

Stacey

All right, we have tried to almost complete a whole month without seeing
eachother.  Now that I have turned thirty, Bridget has run the marathon, and
Kelly had Luke, we no longer havea excuse not to see eachother.  O.K. Kelly,
we might make a small exception for you.  I think we should start off with a
small novella, written by Steve Martin.  Yes, Steve Martin, the comedian.
He has a short book in the stores; he has written.  It is called Shopgirl.
The reviews in Amazon are fairly good.  Does anyone else have a good
suggestion?  I think meeting in the beginning of February would be a good
idea. -Christina
P.S. We miised you, Kelly and Anna at my fine party(oh yeah it was for Kelly
Kampe too!).  Ya'll will just have to hear all about it.

Thank you so much for this query.  At this time, I am not sure what happened to the numbers in our spreadsheet.  The data was pulled from AdHoc by calculating East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank.  However, the total we retrieved from AdHoc did not match the total Portcalc value.  I do not want you to spend time trying to figure out what happened to our spreadsheet because it could have been anything from using the wrong code to calc the books to simple user error.  There are too many variables that are unknown.

The good thing is, it works now.

Thanks,
Stacey

Hi Stacey:

  We were able to pull out the P&L vs Counter Party for the four Post IDs, and the total matched the $986,414,195 you gave, it seems that there are more counterparties than what you included in the spreadsheet.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for details.

 << File: PL_11_30_2001recalc.xls >> 

  Could you let us know how the number in your spreadsheet was generated?  Was it from DPR or some other spreadsheet?  Maybe we can take a look at the query to see if something is missed.

  Thanks,

- Zhiyun

The following post-id's represent the re-calcs for 11-30:

We had one gas deal tonight that had not moved. I moved it to a Alberta ENA book.

John

FYI

Stacey

Thanks,
Just to let you know.  We have moved everything terminated out of the alberta ena book into the albert ena bankruptcy book.  The only deal left in the alberta ena book is a deal with Nexen so when they terminate please let me know.
Thanks

Can you tell me what the post-id was on my original file?

Stacey

Stacey,
Would I also be able to get this calculation as of the 28th.  This would have been backed with deals between ECC and ENA and these deals were terminated Dec 28th.
Kathy

 << File: Engage Deals as of 12-3-2001.xls >> 

Let me know if this is not what you need.

Stacey

have you forwarded to John, or do I need to?

Tim - Can you go ahead and begin gathering the number of books and traders we had at 11-30?!  

All - Other instructions will follow after I receive further clarification on some items from Shona

Thanks!
Casey

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

Are they working on it?

Looks like everything went well. We do not have access to the Terminal Server right now. 

John

Just making sure there are no problems with this migration.  John, did it work for Portland?

Stacey

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

Under the terms of the various agreements among certain Enron entities and UBS AG, certain Enron data and documents may be provided to UBS.  To ensure compliance with those agreements, Enron's document retention policy, as well as directives of various investigative agencies, the attached protocol regarding the process for migration of any information or data to UBS has been developed.

Please review the protocol carefully.  Then, complete the attached Certification and return it, with attachments, to Linda Guinn at EB 3829a no later than February 11, 2002.

Questions about this matter may be directed to Michelle Cash at (713) 853-6401 or Francisco Pinto-Leite at (713) 345-7942 .

Dear Stacey, Casey,

	It seems that nobody even knows what those applications are, and so they will not be migrated to NetCo.

	Please let us know if someone shows up at the last minute.

	Thank you very much for your help,

Norman.

At this time it does not appear that we use the power curves listed below.

Can you all verify that you do or do not use the applications listed below as soon as possible.  We are in the process of moving or discarding applications to move to the NETCO environment and are unaware of who uses the following applications.

Thanks,

Hope all is well.  My new e-mail is stacey.w.white@enron.com  The one you have will be decommissioned shortly.  I still have a job and will more than likely go to the 'new co.' - the piece that UBS has bid for.  Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.

Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?

Stacey

If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.  713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang.

Wasn't sure if you wanted to read the whole letter.  Here it is , if so.

Stacey

All of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian Hunter acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.

Good Luck and stay in touch.

Mark,
Mark,
Hope all is well with you guys in Denver.  
I  hope you are able to continue to make deals and are not caught up in the unbelievable craziness here in Houston.  
I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.
Thanks,
Andy    

Thursday would be great.

I spoke with Jill at the agency, and I will either meet with her later this 
afternoon or tomorrow morning.  She basically just needs some paperwork on 
me and I am then able to start working for you as soon as you'll have me.  
When would you like me to begin?  This week...Thurs?  Just let me know what 
you'd prefer and I'll be there...with bells on!

Jake Thomas

I have to go to the management meeting in San Antonio on the afternoon of the 14th.  Would it be possible to meet in Denver on the morning of the 14th?

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.  

Steve

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

If you have  a minute, give us an update.  We just want to protect our customers ASAP if we can.  We would like to set up alternative purchasers for our producers.

I told Alicia that she and the kids are eating way too much!  She told me that her Oils business is really taking off!  I think she may need to start turning tricks!

I see you referenced Fort Union below, therefore these e-mails to Chris are concerning a well in the Powder River?

Thanks..

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and

are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

I would like to see you get on the Denver 1/2 day schedule.  Any 12 hours you choose from 6:00 A. M. to 8:00 P.M.

I plan to continue my normal schedule of working 6am to 4pm which coincides with noramal Houston hours, covers spot gas trading, covers spot power trading and overlaps with most of my customers hours in the west.  When necessary I will come in early or stay late.  Please let me know if there are any issues there. 
Please circulate to west gas Orig group.

Thanks. BT 

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Sue, Just wanted to let you know that we filed comments in support of Xcel's ability to manage price risk and be incentivized to do so.  If you have questions about our comments, give me a call.

The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.  

Steve

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Would Nov. 1 or 2 work for either of you?

Email me your fax number and I will fax you a copy of what the developers have given me.

Thanks

Calger asked my to be your Sr. Commercial guy on this potential tranaction....It would be helpful if you would spend a little time with me to better explain the business proposition that you see we would promote.  I will be available for a meeting in Denver.  In fact, I am planning on being their the weekend of Nov. 3.  Maybe we can schedule something around that date.

Give me a call

Plain vanilla intervention is fine.

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

Melinda

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?

 
The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.
 
I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.  Who said "the early bird gets the worm?"
 
Dad

What time are you meeting today?  Do you want me to participate?

Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment "true-ups".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some "alternative" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

Dave Fuller

No changes to mine.

Please edit this hot list and send it back to me so I can have it ready for our meeting today.
Thanks, 
Mara

Let's set something up for monday

Dave,
Our tax folks would like to talk to your accountants - is there a name and
phone number contact where we can arrange a call for the experts to talk it
through?

income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they
see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash
payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with
the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds
dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending

the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should

I only added one line, otherwise it looks good.

Please find attached the latest draft of comments.  I have highlighted changes on page 2 referencing fixed-price contracts.

I wish I was that smart!

Didn't want to inflame him as he masterminded the whole thing. When he made
the comments about a pay cut to work at Western, he wasn't talking about
salary and bonus and normal such things.  He was talking about the Enron
management investment gain scheme for which they reaped millions.  Hell, he
and Luce and other employees at Enron probably made a killing shorting the
stock from 80 to 30.

why didn't you send that to whitt

I can show you what the difference is between Cheyenne Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.  To clarify, you do not have to buy on Enron Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.  You do not have to decide that now.  My recommendation is the attached:

Major changes are:

Volume - 20,000 mmbtu/d
Price - Gas Daily Cheyenne Midpoint plus $.05
Demand Charge- $6,000 per month

In addition. Enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu

All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and Enron's review of the PSCo transportation contract.

Let me know what you think.

Mark - do you have historical information on the average price of gas sold
on enrononline vs the cig index.   This information would be helpful for us
in determining how much volume we would want to utilize on the enrononline
pricing.

I understand this is short notice, but I'm heading out of town this weekend, and was wondering if you'd mind if I take Monday off?

Thanks!

Mark,
	Business Controls, which includes Corporate Security at Enron Corp, would like to conduct a security survey of Enron's offices in Denver.  I am tentatively planning on travel to Denver 10/18-10/19.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office it would help greatly in my planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be my point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Lastly, if the above dates do not work for you, please feel free to suggest alternates.  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Could you have someone draft an interruptible purchase agreement for Pioneer Oil.  I will forward you the address.
The attached can act as a starting point for discussions around Enron's purchase of Pioneer's Powder River Basin Methane supplies.

Once you have reviewed it please give me a call at 303-575-6473 and we can discuss it.

 

This is all I have
Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a "Discussion Document" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

We have to go to Little Bear.  Opie Gone Bad is the band.  They are back.

sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?  I still plan on coming 
into the office tomorrow.  Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out 
and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!  (keeping 
my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?  Maybe we 
should do it downtown somewhere.  Comedy works first then dancing?  Keep 
your chin up you handsome devil!

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

   

Please include the following language:

If both parties agree, the CIG Index portion of the pricing can be changed during the term of the contract to reflect other market and transport opportunities.

MArk--I put out a couple of calls to find on the 2002 Governors race in Wyoming, and the feedback I got was similiar to what we talked about.....there has not been a clear candidate yet, and Joe Meyers name is one of three possible Republican contestants. (the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run.

The temp that I hired started today and I would like to make sure she gets paid for today and tommorow.  She knows that is all she can expect.  Let me know if that is a problem.

Can we get this?

Please join us at an all-employee meeting at 10 a.m. Houston time, Tuesday, October 23, in the Hyatt Regency Houston's Imperial Ballroom.

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a "Discussion Document" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

That should keep you busy!

Let me know when your in town.  I will do the same when in Denver.  I guess you heard we bought Can. Hunter.  Another 500+/- per day to sell up North.  FYI

I suggest that you build a boxing ring in the back yard!  Let's try to get together soon.  Sounds like we have both been too busy!

He weighed 8.8 out of the box (I will never admit to saying that).  He then lost back to 7.2 while in ICU but is back on track to 9.2 after three weeks.  He may have a chance.  Lance, the middle man, is one bad mother fro!!!  He takes Luke tot he mat daily just fro sport.  I'm going to have to let Luke defend himself soon - currently we have been telling him he can't hit Lance, but Lance pushes him on a daily basis - must have gotten that from his mother!!

How much does Logan weigh?  Does he stand a chance against his brothers?

Both mom and baby (Logan) are doing much better

How is the little one?  I'm sorry I missed the date!

I missed being there!!!

I don't know why it did not go.  It was huge!  He called it within 15
yds. and took it with a bow.  We missed you in Jackson! Weather was
great, so was the fishing.

Mark - whaaaa sup.  I did not see an attachment - was it big????

That is awsome!

The attached can act as a starting point for discussions around Enron's purchase of Pioneer's Powder River Basin Methane supplies.

Once you have reviewed it please give me a call at 303-575-6473 and we can discuss it.

 

 

To My Dear Wife: 
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 

54 times the sheets were clean 
17 times it was too late 
49 times you were too tired 
20 times it was too hot 
15 times you pretended to be asleep 
22 times you had a headache 
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
16 times you said you were too sore 
12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
19 times you had to get up early 
9 times you said weren't in the mood 
7 times you were sunburned 
6 times you were watching the late show 
5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
9 times you said your mother would hear us 
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 

6 times you just laid there 
8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 

To My Dear Husband: 
I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
36 times you did not come home at all 
21 times you didn't cum 
33 times you came too soon 
19 times you went soft before you got in 
38 times you worked too late 
10 times you got cramps in your toes 
29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you 
    in the balls 
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
2 times you had ! ! a splinter in your finger 
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV 

Of the times we did get together: 
The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. 
I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, "Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?" 
The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. 

Once you read this letter you have to keep it going. 
This game has been played since 1996. 
You must send this letter to 7 people. 
On the 5th day someone will ask you out or say "I love you." 
This is not a joke.  It has worked for many years. 
If you break the chain, you will have bad luck with guys/girls 
forever. 
This is just for future readers. 
This began in 1996, not much of a past, but it works. 
So here are the rules: 
*If you read this on a Sunday, wish for a really fun week 
*If you read this on a Monday, wish for money 
*If you read this on a Tuesday, wish for love 
*If you read this on a Wednesday, wish for success 
*If you read this on a Thursday, wish for anything you want 
*If you read this on a Friday, wish for a really hot date 
*If you read this on a Saturday, wish for an important phone call 
Send this to seven people (after you make a wish). 
Make sure it is sent as soon as you read it or your wish won't come true. 

Good morning!
  
A friend sent this to me and I just couldn't resist
forwarding it out.  It is a small waving flag in the
lower right corner of your screen.

I have been sick all week so it has limited my drinking ability.  Plan on getting lit tonight.  Industry response has been great towards us personally and we have quite a few options.  It is possible that on Monday you will see an announcement on a sale of the trading company, or at least it's employment contracts.  I will let you know what happens.

Are y'all sober yet?

Let me in on what's going on with y'all.

I can see Ken and his boys going to jail. Bend over.

I like those kinds of schedules!

That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 

I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it! 

Love and Kisses 

Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.

Barry,  All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.  But we will sum it up for you.

Mark, I have approved this expense report.. With regards to the Wyoming Gas Fair.  What is the total cost of that trip for you,looks like $ 3,000 or so including airfare, hotel and ancillaries, also ( I believe Paul was there ).  What are his expenses going to be for this? 

Thanks. BT 

The following expense report is ready for approval:

Employee Name: Mark  . Whitt
Status last changed by:  Automated Administrator
Expense Report Name: MW100901
Report Total: $8,470.46
Amount Due Employee: $8,470.46

I would let her know that there is no definite timeline but we are closing a transaction next week.

Any suggestions before I respond to this?

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline. 

Thanks,  Penny

Sorry its taking me so long the guy I need to tlk to is out.  I'll get
you the particulars tomorrow.

Dave

Dave, you also mentioned space on TW - do you have any more information
on
this?

Thanks, Penny

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

 
This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 

Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT 

 

Let's talk it through.

What kind of CIG pricing can a PRB producer get for selling gas in the Powder if you were to buy gas at Deadhorse and Glenrock?

Thanks,

Paul

Please review and share your comments and concerns.
Mark,  Attached are the latest.

  

Theresa Staab and I would like to come to Houston on Monday and spend some time with you and Jason on Tuesday.  We need to discuss some specifics on the purchase proposal such as how you want each netback to be determined, logistics and documentation.

Let me know what time would work for you on Tuesday.  We probably need a fair amount of time.

Tyrell and I are working on a monetization structure for your gathering system.  Can you tell me if the Oil and Gas Division was able to keep the gains associated with the rollout of the hedges?  We think we might have a structure worth looking at.

P.S. Dan and I would like to call you on Friday in regards to the Ft Union capacity.  Some time in the afternoon.

Please find the attached.

 

Brian, After talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the Williams contract instead of being agent.  This is important because we will have title to the gas at Durango.  Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us.  Can you talk to Williams ASAP and see if that is a problem?

Thanks

Mark

Based on last night's mids, it looks like our mini book valuation/reconciliation is pretty tight.

That is cool.

Now here is fine one!
Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile.

Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble.

Mark--here's the article that I mentioned this morning.  Interesting stuff on the long term power contracts

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation. 

Best, 
Jeff 

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Call and we can discuss.  We are open to a videoconference as well.

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Eric, did Suncor every get any drilling completed in the Rockies...?

I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as "a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."

To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

I don't recall a fax number.   I received an email from you that said you were going to forward to your credit department, but I don't remember a fax number.

Look at the weekly strategy product for producers.  Let's see what one of these will look like for our customers.

 

That sounds good.

Mark - do you want to meet before the PUC hearing on Thursday at 8:30?  How meeting me in the lobby of the downtown Hyatt at 7:30am?

We are probably more interested in people who have more experience in the Western U.S.  Preferably direct producer relationships and Rocky Mountain Utilities and Industrials.  We don't do any trading in the Denver office.

Thanks for the lead though.

Good afternoon, Mark.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you on the 15th and regale you
with the background and talents of Christian Schutz.  Just following up to
see if there are any opportunities within your offices that you would be
interested in speaking with him about.  Christian is extremely motivated to
get to Denver and asked that I follow up with you.

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."

To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Yeah, I will mess with it each time I go out with it, but the things we talked about updating are good

Is this your final version?  If not, we need the final so we can get fundies to set up the updates.

Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?  Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada?

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.

All three companies are primarily gas gathering companies.

I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's "extrinsic value".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets . 

that was today... I had heard they were sniffing around about optionality values?  

It is not in the agreement. just a question.

You know that ENA sold our pipeline assets to Northern Border Partners in Q3 of 2001.  That is what became Crestone.  The list I gave you is of who we do business with now.

Thanks, Mark. We have Bear Paw on our list - will check on the others.

All three companies are primarily gas gathering companies.

We usually see mostly regional basis deals out of our office.  Especially with the bigger guys.  We do some Nymex trades for our smaller producers.  It seems the big guys use their banks for most of their  basis.  Thanks for the info.

Decision and physical/financial hedging are all done in the US and with "US types".
They might allow the Cdns to do the odd Aeco basis deal.

Hey guys, new subject.
Got a call today from a cogen in the PNW lookin for AECO, Sumas and Rockies gas.  They're issuing an RFP.  I'll forward it on as soon as I get it and we'll work it together. 
Are you saying that the U.S. Producers are hedging their Canadian Production with U.S. counterparties as opposed to Canadian counterparties?  Or are the decisions being made in the U.S. and executed in Canada?

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

FYI guys

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a
total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is
available for transport.  The contract effective date for this additional
capacity will be on Monday, November 5.  We plan on filing the request for
the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or
Monday.

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of
additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this
last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your
transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service
(anticipated late this month).  For the month of October, the capacity
contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater
utilization for November.  While a few of you have mentioned possibly having
production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining
shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be
necessary until the Loop goes in service.    

Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on
the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information
and planning. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

Oh-- so now your a 'Distinguished' speaker.

Look forward to your talk. Chuck

We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.

Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.

Thanks

These are the new days for the management conference.
During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay 

I made one change.

Please make changes to hot list and send them back to me asap!

I've been giving this some thought for the past few weeks actually, trying 
to figure out how I'd manage as a working mom.  Been there, done that, 
although not with 3 kids, but it's definitely manageable.  Fortunately, 
Brigette is old enough to manage for a few hours after school with the kids, 
until I get home.  My issues would be finding something structured for 
Christian and Brianna during the summers and arranging transportation to and 
from school.  Already have some ideas and options.  It's just a matter of 
committing to one plan or another, and finding out how soon this needs to be 
arranged.  How does my resume look?  Do I need to polish it up for the "big 
wigs", I know it should look more professional.  Are you still thinking a 
temp. position or sending me to the other office for something more 
permanent? Still think you need me in your office though! - Christina

Plan on a couple of hours.  I am not sure about lunch.  I may already have plans.

Having major problems with my server for some reason.  Can't stay connected. 
  9:30 sounds great.  How much time should I plan on spending down there?  
Planning to take me to lunch as well, or is this strictly a business

Do you have an estimate for the cost for the Christmas Party?  Dow you want to split it pro-rata based upon headcount?

You can bill us afterwords.

I have to give the Broker a tentative number on the 12th.  I will let you know what kind of count I have at that point.  I've put down $500 as a deposit and the remainder will be put on someone's card.  

As far as the cost, it's approximately $100/person, depending on how much we drink.  I can either figure a total for your group prior to the evening or wait until the final bill is determined and invoice you for the relative cost.

However you want to work it is fine with me.

Have you started thinking about falling back on that pro wrestling career

Lauren's probably big enough to push a lawnmower or farm-out to the textile

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
"a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."
To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that
Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."
With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand
increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter
generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Isn't it crazy!  I just have a hard time believing it is real.  What have  you been up to?

I didn't know you were living in an apartment.  When did this happen.  What do you mean repair or rebuild?  I hate to hear about you and Nadine.  That is too bad.  Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!  I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.  
 
The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.
 
Too hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.  Not sure I want to work for this new regime.  I guess it all comes down to money.  As always I'm still a whore.
 
 

Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house (repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for Meaghan's sake.
 
How's your clan? Girls driving you nuts?

Wow, I didn't know that you got flooded!  That's awful.  I hate to see that you and Nadine have deteriorated to that point, but if it is over you just have to keep your head up and move on.  If it was me, I think I would start looking for one of those Russian Mail Order brides.  It will cost you a plane ticket and some braces but you won't have to buy a boob job because they all have great tits!  You can't be getting fat.  Aren't you still running?  If not you need to start.  If not for your body do it for your mind.  It is the best thing for that!

Tropical storm Allison did us in. 2 feet of water in the casa. Lost everything except some furniture. Nad's can't make up her freaking mind as to what she wants sooooo, we are moving at a "deliberate" pace. I've reached my "let's make a decision" point a long time ago. We do not like each other anymore, and fight like cats and dogs. I give her until the end of the year before she tells me to hit the road. Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago. Know anyone who wants to have fun with an old fart? I may be fat and ugly but I have been celibate for THREE YEARS.

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal.

We would love to have you and Kim.  Might even be some snow by then.  Just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count.

I think we should still do this, and I may join you guys.

Have you heard anything from the HR lawyers regarding our ability to fire her in the near future for poor performance?

The following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project:

Blueprints	$6,000
Construction	$70,000
Furniture	$3,000
Voice/Data	$4,000 	
*Commisions	$16,000

*Commisions were negotiated by Enron Realty

We had a profit of roughly $70,000 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $11,000 per month on the sublease.

Do you guys have a map showing the interstate grid for the 1-80 corridor?

Paul

The Crestone guys ar the Map guys.  Really it is just WIC, CIG and Williams

Do you guys have a map showing the interstate grid for the 1-80 corridor?

Paul

Am I right about the WIC, CIG and Williams?

I'll chat with Paul and take care of it.  We have stopped getting access to Dwights outside of the Rockies, so I am looking for production data from other sources.  As soon as I get something reliable, I will update the production maps and get copies to you.

Hopefully, here's the link.  I wonder which one is Delainey, Barry, you, et al?

http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/special/enron/1164279

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

This is what we discussed with Heidi a few months ago.

 

It's up to Paul Miller

The only other thing would be if you wanted to add intrastates systems (like OTTCO) and then the pipes at either end of I-80 like Trailblazer, KM, PSCO, KRGT, NWP, Overthrust, and Questar.

Am I right about the WIC, CIG and Williams?

I'll chat with Paul and take care of it.  We have stopped getting access to Dwights outside of the Rockies, so I am looking for production data from other sources.  As soon as I get something reliable, I will update the production maps and get copies to you.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Our new studboy engineer, Dave Scobel, has been sniffing around Cat.  However, I doubt that they're ready to come out of the closet.  She moved into her own apartment to get away from her dork.

I thought that was classic.  Shamu Club.  Haven't gotten the articles yet.  Looking forward to our Vail trip to celebrate our anniverary this weekend.  Nadine comes to our house today.  When you come to our house for Xmas try to be here by Saturday afternoon.  The party that Lenny and Laurie usually have may be at our house since they are in the middle of building their house.  They are driving to Florida after xmas and want to stop and see you either on the way or on the way back.  I gave the Dad's 1-800 number.

Okay, I got one the other day that I thought was too gross to send; if I can find it , i'll forward it...if not, just picture Osama bin Laden under that gal and the caption was something like how to get rid of Osama.  Hope all is well...what's the news?  Did you get all the articles from the Houston paper?  Happy anniversary...Mom

Have you seen this one?  :) Christina

I would probably like Vegetarian but want to know what it is first? 

Thanks, Alicia Whitt 

She is not strict at all, jsut curious.  Let's see what she says.

Hi Mark~~Is Alicia a strick vegetarian?  I havent picked the menu yet, but here's what I'm thinking:
 
Filet Mignon or Filet Wellington
Some sort of fish--Trout, tuna, king salmon
Rack of Lamb or chx chardonnay
Prime rib or another type of steak
 
If any of these will work let me know.  I can choose 4 dinners.  If she is a strick vege, I will see if I can single order off of their vegetarian meal.
 
Thanks,
Kristen

Thanks, Alicia Whitt 

I admire your constant devotion to your customers and your unending DESIRE to restore Enron to it's once great status.  As always you are the consumate proffesional.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

heard last night that forest oil is marketing through aec again in
december.  also heard they have been instructed not to sell to enron.  aec
has also received directives not to sell to enron.  are you hearing that a
lot?

sorry to open with negative news.  hope you're doing well today.  i'm a bit
tired.  was up late for the avs game last night then got up early for my
training at the gym this morning.  may require high amounts of caffeine
today.

might do a quick drink with a friend tonight.  are you working out after
work?  if you have no plans maybe you could meet us for a drink.  it will
be an early night for me.

have a great day

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?

Run the math on this real quick.  UGLY!

Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an "approved" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

Regards,

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.

In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

Have a great time!  Great to hear from you.

Heh Mark,
   This sounds just like Kimmie and your wife to me.  Hope you all have a
great Thanksgiving.  "Gobble, Gobble, Gobble!"

Looks great!  Walk to the slopes, liquor stoe right below, bar acroo the street.  It is right in the middle of the Lionshead village.

Hi Mark,

How was your trip this weekend?  Happy Anniversary!  Did you get a chance to 
check into the Montaneros Lodge?  What did you think.

Thanks,
Elaine

Barry is suggesting that we call David Oxley and make sure he got our Fed ex.  Probably late morning.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new." 

Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

Probably not.

The open season for CIG's Parachute Creek lateral will end next Friday, Nov. 30.  It is for delivery to either NWPL at Sand Springs, Queastar at meter station 101 in Utah, or TransColorado at Dark Canyon.  

Do you need more info on this and/or do you think we will want to participate?  Let me know.

Phil

We are getting paid to si and do nothing..  Now I know what it feels like to be Bujnoch.

 
What is the word dudes?
 
Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
"Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?" 
The crow answered: "Sure, why not." 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"sighed the turkey, 
"but I haven't got the energy. 
"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. 
"They're packed with nutrients." 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
"I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions." 
 
The feet said, 
"We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
" The hands said, 
"We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money." 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Why don't chicks think like us....wouldn't the world be a better place?

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.

A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.

A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.

A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.

A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.

A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.

A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Things are getting bad.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.
  

 
Mark,
I don't think you have any capital expenditures but you're welcome to join in on the call.  I sent the invoices over to Susan Helton (3-1503) in accounting.  She is going to help get the requests done.  Things are still quite fluid and the i-payit system is up (so I hear).  
The number to call is 1-888-324-0279, passcode: 53090#
 
see you at 10 am CST

Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.

Potentially I have a job, reallisticly I don't!

Little Johnny went up to his father and asked him, "Dad, what is the
difference between potentially and realistically?"

The father thought for a moment, then answered, "Go ask your mother if
she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then ask
your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars,
and ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million
dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that."

So little Johnny went to his mother and asked, "Would you sleep with
Robert Redford for a million dollars?" The mother replied, "Of course
I would! I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that." Johnny then
went to his sister and asked, "Would  you sleep with Brad Pitt for a
million dollars?" The girl replied, "Oh absolutely, I'd just love to
do that! I'd do it for free!" Then he went to his brother and asked,
"Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?" "Of course,"
the brother replied. "Do you know how much a million could buy?"

Johnny pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad. His
father asked him, "Did you find out the difference between potentially
and realistically? Little Johnny replied, "Yes, sir. Potentially, 
we're sitting on three million dollars, but realistically, we're
living with two sluts and a fag

What is the word dudes?
 
Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
"Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?" 
The crow answered: "Sure, why not." 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"sighed the turkey, 
"but I haven't got the energy. 
"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. 
"They're packed with nutrients." 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
"I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions." 
 
The feet said, 
"We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
" The hands said, 
"We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money." 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Thanks alot.

Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low "bulk" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the "Shipping" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the "Comments" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Everything is ok, just boring.  Went to the Diamond cabaret for lunch.  We are heading to Texas for Xmas but I doubt we will get to Houston.  Interviewing alot but also waiting on the sale.  We have been promised it will be a good deal.  Oh well, not much else to do.

Take care and thanks for the note.

Been thinking about you, but figured you were busy.  Asked the Jernigan's
how you were doing and if your group was included in the filing.  They said
it was, you were trying to sell your group and that you didn't seem worried
at all, which is good.  Good Luck with that as I know it will be tough.  On
the bright side, if you sell it, you are a friggin hero for pulling off a
deal in a tough environment.  If you don't and go get another job, well
that's what everyone expects anyway.  Again, good luck, tell Lucci hey and

I have to do a presentation on Spark Spreads for NOv 8th.  I need your help putting it together and probably running the presentation for me.  This may have some good info.

 

I will be out the 19th but should be in the 20th.  Amy Felling should be your contact on the 19th.  She is most familiar with our computer systems.

The only other potential office is EOTT.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Please find the attached.

 

Let's discuss
Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

I am ready when you are.

Mark, let's discuss letter to BP prior to it going out this a.m.

FYI - WE'RE CHECKING ON ENTERGY
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as "a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."

To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Barry it looks reasonable to me.  I sure would like to add something sizable to the totals for Q4.

But I'm a pig that way!

Mark, I have reviewed this file and believe it is accurate up to the end of Q3.. Can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance.. I am not worried about 10 or 20,000 either way because I don't think we will manage down to that level anyways. 

BT 

Barry,

Attached is a revised origination schedule for 3rd quarter and supporting detail.

Please provide any revisions by Wednesday, October 31.  I will consolidate the originations for all teams and submit to Louise.

Not Bad
Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.
 
Randy
 
 

Can you find out wha the average rental income is on one like this?

Here's one I ran across. Not huge, but great location(walk to the gondola).  VERY rentable.

I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the "kids" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains".

what about a contract position.... 3 months or something. I was talking to Steve South.. I know steve would like to pick his brain for a while. 

BT 

I am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

BT 

Here it is.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

The meeting will be around 1:00.  Just come to our office at 1200 17th St. Suite 2750.  Then we will go over to Crestone office. I anticipate that the meeting will last about an hour to an hour and half.

Mark

Mark,
	I am assuming we are on for this coming Tuesday given the exchange of e-mail.  I am planning to arrive in Denver by 11:00 and will be going on to Seattle on Tuesday evening.  Where do we meet you?  How long will the meeting go.  I have held off ticketing to until I had some details.  

Steve
That actually works out perfect for my schedule

Jake Thomas
503-464-3803

Can we meet next Tuesday on October 30th?  Afternoon is prefferable.

I am booked all of this week.  Tuesday of next week might work if in the afternoon so I could fly in that morning.

Steve

It works for me.  Steve, would that be possible for you?

I have already made plans for the 14th - How about later this weeks or early next. ?

Jake Thomas
503-464-3803

I have to go to the management meeting in San Antonio on the afternoon of the 14th.  Would it be possible to meet in Denver on the morning of the 14th?

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.  

Steve

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

That seems really high!  What can we do to lower that?

Your account is Pru Advisor which entitles you to a rate of $24.95 per trade.

Would you guys have time to discuss the referenced deal either tomorrow afternoon (we have an Employment Law Essentials presentation tomorrow morning...stay away, Lucci) or Friday?

Thx.

Really well.  We are probably going to have another meeting on the 30th of October.  Jake Thomas and Steve Walton are going to attend.

you spin miester you!  HOw did your meeting go with the Wyoming guys?

I forwarded them our comments and characterized them as being supportive.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?  

Hey Mark--have you talked with your buddies over at Xcel?  

I spoke with the "WebMeister" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
"Business trip or vacation?"

She turned, smiled and said, "Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your
business 
role at this convention?"

"Lecturer," she responded.  "I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality."

"Really, what myths are those?" he asked.

"Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck."

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  "I'm
sorry," 
she said, "I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name."

"Tonto," the man said.  "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."

I am going at lunch to buy tickets.  I'm going to look
at the $11 - $15 range.  Let me know how many you need
before tomorrow at 10am.

If any of you can't decide by then, just buy tickets
on your own and we can all meet at cabo for a beer
before the game.

I assume no word from any of you is a 'no'.

Joannie-

	How's it going?!  Can't remember if we've spoken since I joined
FYI-Net, but I'm part of a local multimedia and software development firm.
Many groups within Enron have used and continue to use our services.

	We have a service that we provide to EnronOnline that may interest
Investor Relations.  From time-to-time, EOL sends us a Powerpoint
presentation, a headshot of a VP, an audio file and written cues.  We
synchronize the presentation and audio, then make it available online from
the EnronOnline website.  Users don't know that they've left the EOL Web
site, we can provide the service inexpensively and we can provide a
standard, 48-hour turnaround on presentations.  Here's what the final
product looks like for EOL:

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>

	We call the product "SlideStreamer," and we can present video as
well as audio - up to you.  We currently have four customers of this service
and have the system down to a routine.

	I realize that today is probably not the best time to discuss this
service, but if you are interested in the product, I would welcome the
opportunity to tell you and the IR group all about it.  You may call me at
(713) 892-8394 or reply to this message to get in touch with me.

Thanks and regards,

David M. Mims

Jason,
I know that you have  been very busy, so hopefully this will help your workload.  I have a  proposed crosscompany netout agreement that hopefully is brief enough that it  will hopefully expedite the process of getting through our mutual legal  hurdles.
Let me know if this  works for you.
Thanks &  hope you have a good weekend!

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Patrick Tucker
x3-3055

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Happy Thanksgiving to you too.  Things at Enron don't look promising for anyone right now, but we'll see what happens.  The stock just keeps dropping and we have more debt around the corner.  Jo and I are going to mom's on Thursday, then we are going to visit her grandparents over the weekend.  We are not going to the game, but we will be watching it on TV.  It doesn't look good for A&M because we got some key guys that are injured, hopefully we can make it a close game.  Have a safe trip and say hi to mimi for me. Talk to you soon. - Jason  

Hi Jason,
First of all, just want to wish you Joanna a happy thanksgiving.  We certainly have a lot to be thankful for.  Susan and I are leaving tonight visit her dad.  I'm going up to Wisconsin to visit Mimi in two weeks.  She still sound very tired.
Hear a lot of stuff about Enron.  I hope you are still doing OK.  I'm sure you've created value for yourself and should be fine.  It is just amazing to see a company that size make the mistakes that it did. But, the bottom line is that it is run by humans.  And that is how we learn.
Are you going to the game on Friday?  It would be great to see A&M pull out a win.
Love,
Dad

I got your message, and I'll take care of it.  Thanks for your help.

Jason, 

Effective November 1, 2001 your salary should be transferred to Hunter Shively's cost center: 107317.   I need you to enter this new cost center into your timesheet.  The way that you do this is to enter the new cost center number into the space that says Rec. CCtr for November 1 - 15th.  Also, you will need to manually enter 8 hours worked for each day so that SAP will pick up your time and expenses and put them in the new cost center.  You will also need to do the same thing for November 16 - 30th.   

Please write me back and let me know that you have received this message.  Also, please call me with any additional questions.  

Thanks for your time and assistance in this matter.

Elizabeth,
The best way to get Jason's salary transferred to the correct cost center (since it is only one pay period back), is to have him go into his SAP timesheet and have him code his time to the new cost center.  This way the system (SAP) will correct all his payroll costs automatically.  
If you need help explaining to him how to do this, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian

Brian, 

Please note that Jason Williams should be transferred out of CC: 103872 effective November 1, 2001 and put in Hunter Shively's Co: 0413/CC: 107317.

I have a work crawfish boil that same day I am supposed to go to and Jo is out of town that weekend.  I am gonna have to try and Finagle? my way out of this one so I can go to the Hatcher's,(itll be much more fun).  Did ya'll find a house?

Effective Friday the 13th of April, I will no longer be employed by Larry
R. Cook & Associates, PC.

I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowly
grinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legend
in my own mind.

I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consultin=
g
www.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration and
compliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurance
companies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company through
financial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billable
in a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigated
matters involving securities - both for and against brokers.

MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - so
the Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!

Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,
the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  We
will remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access to
one another as this transition occurs.

For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer be
able to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect as
I will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financial
world and the information that comes with that.  However, for those of
you not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts=
.
 Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you on
your portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)
do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to another
broker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.
  With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.
Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at any
time.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'm
involved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to place
trades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,
etc., that's more than great!)

Most of my contact information remains the same:

home 281-362-1379
mbl 281-794-6300
internet email danaltom@hotmail.com
presumed new work email daltom@mglconsulting.com
mgl main line 281-367-0380

Dan

PS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity to
shamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened an
art gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollect=
ion.
com=20

Whatever you want us to do is fine.  we just want to hang out with you guys and enjoy some time with yall.  Cant wait, its gonna be a blast.

Hi again,

Hope your feeling better sweety. Good to hear you had a great time away.
Tan? When we were in Fiji you were trying to convince me that you had
one - baby, you have one all year round!! I love your skin.

I will probably be spending 1-2 weeks in London at this stage. We are
trying to plan the rest of our journey in Europe and I'm trying to get
four weeks off so that I can spend even more time with you.

Are both the girls still staying with you? Say hello to Jo for me. I
can't believe I haven't seen her since you left.
Have a great time going out for your B'day this weekend. It's your 30th!
But we both know you have the energy of a an 18 year old when it
counts!!

Speak to you in a couple of days.
Lisa. xx

I had a great time. The weather was macnificent. And I have a great tan.
My
brothers wedding went smoothley.
But its great news that you will be spending more time in London. How
much
time exactley? It would be a marvellous scope if you could pull off a
transfer to London as well. I am currently at the moment feeling a bit
sick
because last night I ate some dodgy food.

Jo and Nichole have settled in to London life. They are both cool. They
have both found jobs so its all going smooth.
We will all be going out this weekend for my birthday.

Love

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Joe:

Two Ferrel International tickets above on Feb 1 & Feb 2 were changed in the system
to Ferrell North America by Derek Bailey.  This in incorrect.  Ferrel International is a different
corporation and the deals should stand as the trader wrote them.  New confirms in
the original name, Ferrel International, need to be resent.

This is the main reason that I have asked all your contract people to NOT change
counterparty names on my deals.  Many times, credit has incorrectly requested
counterparty name changes.  I would appreciate it if you would NOT change counterparty
on my deals.

Please let us know if you have any trouble resending these confirms.

Hi Jason, Brant,

I understand that you have been looking at Ormet Corp, and at Ormet Primary Aluminium Corp. The metals originators are thinking of a potential transaction with Ormet Corp and are asking us for information that we may have available on the companies.

Do you have any financial information on these companies? Which kind of transactions are we involved in with them?

Here is the spreadsheet, ill show you how to read it when you get a chance.

 

Lisa - here are the deal I was telling you about.

Jay - I tried pulling the confirms up on both of these deals this morning in DCAF, and I get a message saying there was no confirm.  The notes to both deals state that you are working on the confirm.  Have these deals been confirmed yet?  Also, if they have, can you get me a copy?  If they could be faxed to 713-646-8420 it would be great.

I addition, on a regular basis, Lisa Valderrama and Pam Boxx need to be copied on any Emails like this.  That way if one of us is out of the office, the others will be able to make sure the invoice/payments take place on time.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Bryce -

Per our telephone conversation this morning, following are details on my two deals that need to be invoiced on revised schedules:

WEIRTON STEEL CORPORATION, deal QZ2383

This is a physical gas deal, running from 4/1/01 through 3/31/02.  I would like to have this invoiced on a 15-day cycle, where counterparty payment is due on the 1st of each month and the 15th of each month.  Sitara # is 693548.  We need to send them an invoice IMMEDIATELY for the first 15 days of April.

IMPERIAL SUGAR COMPANY, deal QY8339

This is also a physical gas, running from 4/1/01 through 6/30/01.  I want to have this invoiced on a 30-day cycle, where counterparty payment in due on May 1, June 1, and August 1.  Sitara # is 689632.

Please call me (ext. 53923) if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jay Williams

oh yeah, I cant wait till you have you first annual crawfish boil deck bash.

I hope everyone had a goodtime, the weekend just goes by to damn fast.

Gentlemen,
	I understand that the policy is to call a customer for a line of credit when it is warranted.  I would request that we review Frontier's Credit line and I believe that we should be able to increase this line significantly.  US refining margins are at record highs, US refinery earnings are at record highs (See Valero's, Tosco's), and Frontier is a very significant and loyal Enron customer.   They are releasing 1st Quarter earnings on the 27th of this month and should be in-line with the earnings of the other independent refiners.  Could you please review this status and issue a new credit line, so we can continue to build both Gas and Global Markets business with this customer.   Thanks

Mark

Jason
I had to stop Boardwalk doing a financial deal today for Nov 01 - March 02.  The volume for that period is small 150,000 GJ in total but the customer is very unsophisticated.  We need to put a summary of the applicable credit provisions (as previously discussed) and contract in front of them.  As this deal is short term in nature and only in Canadian Dollars we have decided to use the Short Form Master Financial Trading Agreement.  Jason can you please help us get this done.  We initiated the process at our end on April 5.
Many thanks
Kate

Follow up to e-mail request for credit worksheet  for FPC on April 11th.   Tammi needs to send a draft to the customer today.

Thanks !!

	Hey dude, what's going on?  I'm glad we got a chance to chat the
other day even if it was brief.  The Navy has really gotten even with me
ever since I got married.  Those years during flight school where I had a
bunch of time to goof off were awesome, but unfortunately over.  I guess
they wait until a pilot has all of his qualifications and then they
definitely get their money out of him.  It only makes sense.  I can't
believe I'm finally on my deployment.  This has been a cloud hanging over my
head for some time now.  I guess I'll be back soon enough.  We are in
transit steaming out to the far east and just passed the Yucatan Peninsula,
Cuba, and Jamaica.  Unfortunately, we did not get to stop in any of those
places.  These e-mails could potentially be monitored because they are sent
via satellite so I am unable to tell you where we are or where we are going,
only where we've been.  I'll keep you posted.  The conditions on this ship
are not too bad.  I've got a nice stateroom and everything I need for a
cruise.... Except the ability to get off when I want to and see my wife.  I
have not been flying too much lately, I've been standing a lot of watch
though.   I guess they are letting the newer guys get some experience.  When
you're in  the middle of the ocean standing watch at 3 am and its so dark
that you can't see anything (not that you can see anything but water anyway)
it's a pretty calming feeling.  You can see so many stars its unbelievable.
There are no city lights to drown them out and its spectacular.  We have hit
some rough seas and landing on the ship has been challenging, but good
practice.  I've been pretty busy because I just took over a new division.
I've got 60 young guys that are extremely hard workers but sometimes don't
always use the best judgment. I'm sure I'll have some interesting stories
when I get back.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hey and give you the scoop on
me.  I hope to be a little bit better about keeping in touch out here.
Please say hello to everyone for me and could you please send me Hatcher's
e-mail address.  Also, if you could do me a favor and say hey to Cassey
every once in a while, she's pretty lonely.  Until next time, Adios!!!

I am going to paper this transaction today and I wanted to be clear that Credit is completely on board.

Velsicol's current booked transaction is 310 mmbtu per day at 140% of IF-HSC through January 31, 2005.

I am going to book 310 mmbtu per day at $5.25 from June through December 2001 and 
					at IF-HSC  plus $1.50 from January 2002 through January 2005
				
I am then going to extend the end date until January 2008 with the same volume @ IF-HSC plus $1.50.

I believe Tanya and Jason both have given me approval in April but I wanted to verify one last time prior to booking.

Thanks,

Gary

Jai

Boardwalk have requested that we modify the CREDIT ANNEX for the financial swap.  They are requesting that the material adverse change in point (i) is changed from 4.0 to 1.0 to 5.0 to 1.0.  The rational for this request is that it would be consistent with their mortage policy.  They obtain finance from the Canadian Mortage Housing Corporation.  Boardwalk are able to borrow up to 85% of the value of the property.

"Material Adverse Change" means (a) with respect to Counterparty, it shall have any of the following occur at any time:  (i) the ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 4.0 to 1.0, or (ii) its Net Worth falls below Cdn. $250 million, or (iii) the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Charges is less than 2.0 to 1.0.; or (b) with respect to ECC, Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating is below "BBB-" by S&P.

Secondly:
They want the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Charges changed to 1.15 to 1.0 and it to be reviewed on an annual basis.  Again to be consistent with how they run their business.  Boardwalk's current ratio is 1.97 to 1.0 so the 2.0 to 1.0 is a problem for them.

Please get back to me ASAP.

Thanks

Kate

Bryan,

Do we have enough guys tonight to have a game?

No, I told Sharon Probably.  I make sure Yes's never come out of my mouth.  I might just get locked in if I do.

Jason,

The following replied to my original e-mail:

- Ferg: Pretty sure, gotta check with my wife.
- Hatcher: I am up for playing.
- Scott: I might be.  I need to talk to Kathy about it first.
- Von: see you then
- Jason: no e-mail reply, but his assumed answer is, "I don't reply until
the very latest possible time so that I have an opportunity to look at all
of my options and chose the one that matches my interest that particular
day, hour, or minute." :-)  Actually, Jason told Sharon that he was in last
night, but he may change his mind after that dig.
- Mike: out
- Todd: out

We definitely have three (Von, Jason, and me).  If all of the maybes come
(Ferg, Hatcher, & Scott), we will have six.  Please confirm if you can make
it tonight.

Thanks,
- Bub

Thanks for your help on all my stuff.  Everything should be set up just like April 11.  Its in the system as Max SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out Will Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.  Thanks again and I'll check with you in the morning to make sure everything is ok.  I'll have my pager if there is a major crisis, I dont anticipate one though.

Jeff,
	Sorry for all the resumes lately, but everyone wants to get their foot in the door at Enron.  This resume is from my wife's cousin, who is looking to get a summer internship at Enron.  She is a very sharp young lady with a great work ethic.  I don't know if you are hiring for internships, if not, could you please forward this on to the person hiring for those positions.  I greatly appreciate any help you could give.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks again for your help.

Tim,

I will be available all week.
Thank you for the opportunity,

Bill

Thanks for your interest in the Assistant Trader positions.  We have had sixteen people express interest in this role.  Based on the criteria listed below, you have been selected to be interviewed for this role.

Been in a trading or scheduling position for at least one year.
Consistently received high performance ratings through the PRC process.
Has consistently pursued a trading role as a career objective.

We are hoping to hold interviews during the next two days and make our decision by the end of the week.  The interviews will be conducted by members of the trading team.  Please send me an e-mail to let me know when you WON'T be available during the next few days.  You will be going through three separate half hour interviews with Crandall/Scholtes, Richter/Mallory, and Belden/Swerzbin.  Thanks.

Regards,
Tim

Bert,
This is good to know. Thank you for the update.
Well done.
B

Bill:

Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:

Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).

Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).

SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).

I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.

Regards,

Bert Meyers

Group,
We all knew it was coming. NERC Compliance surveys are continuining. Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load. THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST. Templates and POR/POD sheets are available. If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know.
Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill, 

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.  

ds

ST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230. I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15. I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.

ST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. Chris Mallory brokered this deal.

Thanks
Bill

This is appropriate--do not make the Enpower till the next day if it will be under St-Whourly....

We sold 8mw around the clock to Gas Recovery systems at 34 dollars.   The deal is built in Caps but not in enpower.

Thanks,

All,
	Attached are two PDF files, one detailing why the CAISO is going to start assessing Grid Management charges to A/S self-provision, and one detailing the budget breakdown for 2002.  The good news is that their proposal to FERC is not as bad as the first one presented at the last Market Issues Forum, but the increases are still steep.  Page 10 of the budget attachment has a graph detailing the old and new rates.  All that is left is for FERC to approve it.  The proposed new rates for 2002 will be as follows: 

CC	Old Rate:	New Rate:	Percentage Increase:	
				
521	0.406	0.575	42.00%	
522	0.223	0.368	65.00%	
523	0.951	0.957	1.00%	

Please see the attached files for further details.  Let me know if you have any questions.

A truly useful fount of knowledge...

Here you go.....
A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower, containing the seed. After fertilization takes place and the embryo (plantlet) has begun to develop, the surrounding ovule becomes the fruit. Yum. I won't go on about the four types of fruit--simple, aggregate, multiple and accessory--which explain things like berries and pineapples.

A vegetable is considered to be edible roots, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits, seeds, flower clusters, and other softer plant parts. In common usage, however, there is no exact distinction between a vegetable and a fruit. The usual example is the tomato, which is a fruit, but is eaten as a vegetable, as are cucumbers, peppers, melons, and squashes. The classification of plants as vegetables is largely determined by custom, culture, and usage. 

Okay, now the part which may surprise you. A grain is described as the dry fruit of a cereal grass, such as the "seedlike fruits of the buckwheat and other plants, and the plants bearing such fruits." So, grain is also a fruit.

Keoni,
I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the "solutions" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. 

I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill, although I have not received an e-mail from you describing the details
of the issues you were having with schedule submissions and congestion I
thought I would forward you the name of the gentlemen that will be able to
assist you in our Market Operations group who deals with technical issues of
the sort.  His name is Michael Glatz and he can be contacted at

Murray,

Thank you for your interest in our group. I will certainly keep you informed of our next available opening. We will likely have some openings in February (it always seems to happen around that time). As you might assume, we are interested in hiring the best person for the job, if you were that person, then we would do our best to facilitate your move. 

Again, thank you for your interest, and if you have further questions just give me a call.

Bill

Hi Bill,

I wanted to let you know that I had a talk with John Zufferli and he is alright with me transferring to your office subject to you hiring me.

I really am excited about this possibility!  As I said on the phone on Wednesday, I would love to come and work for you in Portland.  When I saw the advertisement for the Real Time Specialist on the Enron website I had to call you to see if the position was still available.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

I learned so much when I came down in June to watch your traders.  I speak with them all a lot on the phone and I am continually striving to learn more about the power business south of the border.  In fact, now that there's potential to come work for you, I'm going to work even harder to learn more about west power trading.

Please keep me in mind when the next available real-time position comes up.  I would be happy to come work for you as early as the beginning of the new year.  Do you know when you will be in the market for another trader?  And more importantly, would you be willing to hire a Canadian?  I don't suppose there would be a problem getting a green card considering I would just be transfering offices for the same company.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks a lot Bill, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Murray     

Traders are as follows:

Bill Williams III
Ryan Slinger

Thanks for making sure this is squared away,

Please send me a list of the real time traders who will be using FSP.  We have found that people who started after our last attempted roll-out (like Serena), had access problems to the FSP applications.  We want to test their access.

Chris,
I have some information regarding our payment to MPC that you and I discussed yesterday. Apparently we cut them a check for $19,937.35 (or thereabouts). The check no. is 9600043219. The check was cut on 01/15/02. MPC does not know why they received this payment. Rich Bruegger is my contact at MPC. Please let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks,
Bill

Diana,
Here is the message that Kate sent to Diane, and the original messages from Diane are below that. I think we will have this sorted out going forward.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Bill

Diane -

I'd like to clarify the type of information Real Time needs in order to fulfill positions for the short term desks. 	As we're all sadly aware, PGE has become increasingly frustrated with our confusion regarding delivery points when we do lending and parking deals with them, so it is imperative that any information included in an e-mail to Real Time corroborates with data entered into Enpower. Following are the discrepancies I see between Enpower and the information given to Real Time:
 
1. On Sunday, according to Enpower, STNW is long on peak @ PGE System. The deal number that would be relevant to Real Time in this case would be the purchase (855033, not 855032). That way we can link our real time sales to the day-ahead purchase in Deal Scheduling. Also, Diana confirmed that this length should be sold off @ Mid-Columbia, not PGE System, which is not what is shown in Enpower. 

2. On Monday, according to Enpower, STNW is short 53 mw on peak @ Mid-Columbia. The relevant deal number here would be 855044 - again, we only need to know the deal number that corresponds with your position. Also, since anything that alludes to the wrong hours, delivery point, or deal number only serves to confuse the traders on shift, I was thinking it might work better if we sat down and went over these positions together before sending anything out to the group. (This is what I do with Holden when STSW does lending or parking deals.)

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.

Thanks,
Kate 

Forgot the light load on Monday and deal numbers - 
The deal number is 855032.1 for Sunday the 4th 7-22 Heavy Load  Hours only.  

The deal numbers for the 53 MWH on light load for Monday is 854942.1/855044.1 - please supply at PGE System.
For November 4th, Midc HL hours 7-22 only, we are 50 long, please supply at PGE system.

Diane Cutsforth

Is the bet that I will reject the idea?

Bill -

It has come to my attention that several members of the Real Time group would prefer an outing that involves running, hiding, and shooting balls of paint at each other instead of engaging in polite conversation while cordially sipping cocktails at McMenamin's Edgefield. They do not want time to get to know each other in a civilized setting outside of work. They want to beat the living crap out of each other. I am merely letting you know so I can win a bet for $7,000.

Chip,
Could you help me put Enpower on my local computer?
And my monitor keeps sleeping on the job.
Thanks,

This is at the top right after you turning the volume on your computer down.
Also...
Right after the boxes, but parallel to FSP parallel testing.
Thanks,

Bill -

Would you like me to work with Cara on this? I know you initially asked Mark Guzman to test it, but it appears she may be looking for some kind of feedback soon. Like I said, I tried getting into it today to go through the format, but was unable to. So my question is - where is this on our priority list?

Kate

Good Afternoon,

I was able to import all of the Palo Verde Heavy Load schedules into Path Confrimation!  

The sorting and Pathing looks right.  After routing the screen froze completely, but routing was done. I had to end task to get out of the PSW, and we will look at why this error occurred.

With Real time Approval,  If this month goes well for me at PV we will attempt to put everyone on the system starting December 1.  If I do not hear anything from real time, I will assume passive approval has taken place.

There are still some issues with running the build route report, but they are being worked on now.  

I am routing day-ahead to test, but am wanting direction from real time as to whether to route ahead or after the day. Right now the only deals un-routed on PV Heavy are the Parking Deals from PNM and EPE

Thanks,

Cara

Pretty much, its turning into the only day they have available for what we need...short of Thanksgiving weekend or late December...which is getting a bit close to the Holidays...

What do you think? Is it a good way to end the month?

is the 30th set in stone?

Cara,
Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry. Hopefully it still works for you guys. Did you want to get rooms as well. If so just speak with Jill Chatterton. More to follow.

Please be sure to send me an email regarding changes, and write them on the schedule.

Darin,
I need you to send emails regarding our disputes to myself and Kate Symes. Please do NOT send emails regarding our disputes to our customers--El Paso or others. Also, my email is bill.williams.iii@enron.com. I appreciate the email, but I had to receive it from our customer. Let's set up a time to meet and run through some things on Sunday or Monday morning. Give me a call on my cell phone on Saturday when you have a chance.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill - Did Darin put in a tape request for this already?

Hi Kate,

I noticed you were not on the distribution list.

Let me know what you find out.

Kathy
To whom it concerns,

I had a discrepancy with SRP for a purchase in the hour for HE 19.  I
spoke to SRP at 4:55 and again at approximately 5:02 about purchasing
energy for HE 19.  HE 20 was not part of the discussion.  I spoke to
them about the hour we were ramping into and the hour we were in each
time I spoke with them.  I decided to leave the 25mw purchase in and
review the tapes.  I have made a note of this on the model for 10/28/01.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks,
Darin L. Presto

Kysa,
This is totally inappropriate and HIGHLY unprofessional. In these difficult times we need to continue to put forth and display Enron's core values: Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. I look for this in each one of my coworkers and for every member of the real-time team. Please see what you can do to better respect Kate's feelings and the effort she puts in each day.

I will certainly go over these PMAs when I receive the document from Risk. I believe Fran was just giving us a heads up for tomorrow. I will, as usual, review each charge and determine its validity before anything hits these books.

Just need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90? My impression is that this was totally trued up...
Is this some weird tranny charge?

As always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month.

Dear Mr. Williams:

I am contacting you at the suggestion of Hollie Krebs.  I would like to arrange a brief meeting in which I could obtain your expert advice and insight on your company and the industry in which you operate.

I am in the networking phase of searching for a new career opportunity.  Hollie and I discussed some aspects of her career as a marketer of utilities.  She mentioned that, with my background, your industry would be excellent to evaluate.  Hollie spoke very highly of you and your company.  She thought that I would learn a great deal from your expertise.

Please understand that I am not expecting you to know of a job opening nor am I asking you to help me find one.  I believe your guidance will help me to further develop my career strategy.  I am enclosing my resume for you to critique. Please be candid with any advice and/or ideas that you may have.

During the last eleven years, I worked as General Manager of Sunset Office Outfitters and Office Manager of Chemcentral Corporation-Portland.  The president of Sunset recruited me to help turn around his business. My primary responsibilities at Sunset Office were to correct serious personnel and financial problems, create policies and procedures to allow the company to refocus on marketing.  Chemcentral is a large, international chemical distributor.  My duties as Office Manager were to generate and analyze financial statements, manage personnel issues, create and monitor company policies and procedures.  Both companies provided great learning experiences for me.  My combined administrative and sales experience should prove very beneficial in my next position.

I realize your time is very valuable.  You mentioned that you will call me today around 3:00 p.m.  I would like to arrange a brief appointment at a time that is convenient for you.  My questions deal primarily with your education, career path and your opinion on what career(s) I should be pursuing.  I will talk to you soon and thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Ken McClintock

Geir,
I need to get a working cell phone number for you. I tried to reach you at home today regarding the postponement of our meeting. Please give me a call or send me an email with your contact info.
Thanks,
Bill

Matt,
I like the Mcleod Resume the best. I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback. Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again. It looks like you have a good start. I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them.
Good luck.

Bill

what can i do with these?

Matt,
I will work on these this afternoon and give you some ideas...
BTW-I heard from Kochel this morning, he is getting married March 2nd in Seattle--did you know his sister was already married to Steve Darue? (poor woman!). The Kelso/Camas game is on Thursday--maybe I will take Friday off...what do you think?
Check your hotmail around 3.

Kate,
Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day. I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control. She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45. I am not sure where I am at on this index, your feedback will play a large role in whether we participate in this index. Sorry for the short notice.
 
Bill
 
It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you. 
 
Thanks,

You can go ahead and talk to Fran...Also, how was you vaca?
And I have some things for you to take care of from Thursday and this weekend when you have a chance.
Thanks,

B

Have you talked with Fran about this yet? Or would you like me to?

Kate and Bill:

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

-Fran
I have entered the following annuities to account for discrepancies incurred during the checkout process of February, March, and June 2000. This is per records generated by Amy Clemons. Please direct any questions to Amy or me.

February 2000
Sales - 813409
Purchases - 813416

March 2000
Sales - 813417
Purchases - 813418

June 2000
Sales - 813419
Purchases - 813420

Net DPR impact to the EPMI Short Term West Hourly book will be $108,388.02. All annuities are scheduled to calculate at HE 24 today.

Group,
As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pacific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.
Thanks,

Bill

I still need to interview Stacy but will have feedback when I finish.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill

I wanted to check in with you in regards to the Real Time Trading Interviews.  Do you have any feedback on the candidates?

Thanks,

Group,
We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.

For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone. 

Do call with questions.
Cell: 503-887-3449
Home: 503-274-0502

Thanks,
Bill

Alan,

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as " Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver"
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Thanks for the help.

Bill

All:

Note that the plan to clear overlapping incs and decs is NOT the immediate change.  In the short run, CAISO will imput supplemental bids at cost based on heat rates, gas prices, etc. (Read the bottom half of this first).

I am attaching an other CAISO document on this topic.

If you want a briefing on these changes, please let me know.

Other than the imposition of penalties, I think we are generally supportive of the L-T fix, which will be made via a tariff change (i.e., we will have an opportunity to comment).

MARKET NOTICE
October 24, 2001
Implementation of Revised Target Price Methodology
ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlements Contacts:
Effective Monday, October 29, 2001 the California Independent System
Operator Corporation ("ISO")  will revise its methodology for calculating
the Target Price ("TP"). Provided below is a background on TP, a brief
description of the ISO's current thinking about a long-range solution and
potential implementation schedule, and the ISO's current short-range TP
methodology to be implemented on October 29, 2001.   
Background
The ISO operates a Real-Time Market for Imbalance Energy ("IE")  based on
bids submitted by Market Participants seeking to sell incremental and/or
decremental Imbalance Energy.  In many cases, bids have a "price overlap,"
which occurs when some Scheduling Coordinators ("SCs") are willing to buy
real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted decremental IE bids to reduce
their generator output) at prices higher than the prices at which other SCs
are willing to sell real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted incremental
IE bids to increase their generator output).  
In March 1998, the ISO instituted the TP to eliminate the price overlap
described above. The TP is a calculated price between the highest
decremental bid and the lowest incremental bid.  All incremental bids above
the TP are adjusted down to the TP and all decremental bids below the TP are
adjusted up to it.
Though designed to resolve the price overlap, there are certain difficulties
with the TP as it was implemented.  The major problem was that the ISO
cannot "clear the overlap," i.e., accept all overlapping bids and require
the bidders to actually buy and sell at these prices.  SCs can, and do, use
the inability of the ISO to clear the price overlap to manipulate the TP by
submitting unrealistically high offers to buy and unrealistically low offers
to sell, knowing that the ISO can not require the bidders to fulfill their
bids. 
In April 2000, the ISO sought to eliminate this gaming opportunity by
changing the formula f74or calculating the TP.  As a result, there were many
hours when the TP -- and the published price for Real Time Energy
transactions - was zero.  Thus, while the revised methodology reduced gaming
opportunities, it also produced unrealistic real-time prices that distorted
incentives for SCs to bid into the ISO's Real-Time Market.
Long-Range Solution
After extensive internal review and discussion with Stakeholders, the ISO
has concluded that the best solution is to accept overlapping bids, thus
entirely eliminating the need for the TP.  At its September 20, 2001
meeting, the ISO Governing Board approved this concept.  This long-range
solution will require an ISO Tariff and certain computer software changes
and will not be implemented until approximately Summer, 2002.   Detailed
below is the ISO's interim, short-term TP methodology that will become
effective three business days after this Market Notice, on October 29, 2001.
Short-Range Solution
Also described in the ISO staff memorandum presented at the September 20,
2001 ISO Governing Board meeting and as discussed at the October 3, 2001 and
11, 2001 Market Issues Forum meetings, the ISO will implement an interim
solution to address some of the difficulties with the current methodology
until the ISO can implement the longer-range solution.  Thus, by this Market
Notice, Market Participants are noticed that the ISO will implement the TP
methodology described herein effective Monday, October 29.  
The revised methodology is similar to the original TP methodology, but
features several important enhancements to limit gaming opportunities by
incorporation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") orders for
price mitigation, limiting the ability of Participating Generators and
Participating Loads to set the TP, and permitting only feasible bids to be
eligible to set the TP.  
Under the original TP methodology, as established in March 1998, a TP
replaced all bid prices within the incremental - decremental price overlap.
The TP was calculated as the market-clearing price ("MCP") that would result
if the overlapping incremental and decremental bids were matched with one
another and Dispatched in merit order through BEEP.  Graphically, this
Target Price can be calculated as the intersection between the incremental
supply curve and the mirror image of the decremental supply curve over the
price axis, as shown in Figure 1. 

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
Figure 1. Price overlap elimination by Target Price

The interim, or short-range, TP methodology differs from the original TP
methodology in the following ways: 
*	Only bids from Generating Units under Participating Generator
Agreements ("PGA") or Loads with Participating Load Agreements ("PLA") will
be eligible to set the TP.  This restriction is needed to ensure compliance
with FERC requirements that only participating resources are eligible to set
the MCP.  When the ISO does not Dispatch Imbalance Energy, the TP will
become the MCP.  Thus, only Generators with PGAs and Loads under PLAs will
be eligible to set the TP.  For this reason, inter-tie transactions will not
be eligible to set the TP.
*	Only capacity that can be Dispatched within 10 minutes will be
eligible to set the TP.  This requirement ensures that the TP can only be
set by Generating Units that actually can be Dispatched to meet California's
Load.  This capacity will be based on the total of all Energy and Capacity
products and services bids submitted by each Generating Unit.    For
example, a Generating Unit with a 1MW/minute ramp rate can only increase or
decrease its output by 10 MW within a 10-minute interval, regardless of the
combination of Ancillary Services capacity and Supplemental Energy bids it
has submitted  Thus, its qualifying capacity would be 10 MW.  Priority in
allocating bids to the qualifying capacity will be based first on lowest bid
price, and then on increasing qualities of service.  Although only
qualifying capacity will be considered in the TP calculation, all bids
within the price overlap will be adjusted to the resulting TP.
*	As a final adjustment, the TP will not be higher than the lowest
available gas-fired resource proxy price, as calculated for the
corresponding hour, unless such a proxy price is below the bottom of the
price overlap.  In any such case, the TP will be set to the lowest
incremental Energy bid. The Target Price will also not exceed the applicable
Price Cap.  This provision will ensure that bids dispatched under the TP
will conform to the FERC's requirements on market mitigation pricing.
The short-term TP methodology will use the following equation:
	TP? = max{0, min{TP, LPP, PRC }, LIP}	(1)
where:
TP?	is the adjusted Target Price;	
TP	is the Target Price that clears the price overlap;	
LPP	is the lowest proxy price (applicable to gas-fired resources)	
LIP	is the lowest incremental price.	
PRC	is the applicable Price Cap.

Mike,
Your cell phone is not working or has been disconnected and I have no way to reach you. Please update me with your contact information as soon as possible.
Thanks,

Bill

Take these days off too.

Bill -

Good to hear you're a big believer in time off. How about a compromise? I'll wait until the middle of next month, and then I'd like to take off Nov. 12-16. That way, I'll be available to settle October, November, and hopefully many months to come. Sound good? Let me know. And I appreciate your understanding.

Kate

Kate,
It is the end of the month and just like everyone else in your group you are needed to be at work at certain times. Granted, renewed motivation can be a great thing to help you attack various job functions with vigor, and I am a big believer in it. We have in the past discussed that I would prefer  that you take personal days/vacation days in the middle of the month and at the end of the week. If you would like to plan a longer vacation in advance, again like everyone else in your group, please just let me know.
I appreciate your understanding.

Bill
I'm glad to know that I have only one purpose here. If that's the case, then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off. And the purpose was NOT not to settle October - which is of course something I await with bated breath. The purpose was to relieve some of the pressure I'm starting to feel and ideally return with renewed motivation to do my job well. While I realize this should be something I do all the time, without occasional days off for incentive, I think you can understand that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. I can hardly believe I'm so indispensible you couldn't survive two days without me with a week's notice. Come on....

How? Unless the purpose was to not settle October...which would defeat A purpose of you working here...

Bill -

That completely defeats the purpose of my taking time off. Forget about it.

Kate

Kate,
If you are flexible, I would prefer if you took the 8th and 9th of November off. This would allow us to settle up PMA's at the end of October and make sure we are settled going into November. 

Let me know if this is what you would like to do.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill -

What would you think about me taking off next Thursday and Friday? If that doesn't work, perhaps the following Monday and Tuesday? Let me know.

Please be advised that the SI Server Certificates on the primary SI site in
Folsom will expire in about a month.  We are planning to install ISO
issued/trusted Certificates on the Folsom SI servers as we have already done
on the Alhambra server several months ago. We presently use Verasign as the
Third Party Trust.  We would like input from you as to any known issues with
authentication at the Alhambra SI site and any impact you may have seen
after our implementation there.  Please provide feedback to me via e-mail
prior to this Wednesday's TSWG meeting and I will consolidate concerns so
that we may discuss these in that forum.

I received this message yesterday from a student group at the University of Washington. Do you still want some to go to Seattle and stir up interest?
 
Bill
 
Bill Williams,
 
    As you know, the Dow Dawgs are an Investment Club at the University of Washington.  KC Anderson informed us of your interest in coming to one of our meetings.  My officers and I are happy to hear of your interest and would like to help you get the word out about Enron. 
    We were hoping you could make it to our next meeting Wednesday (10/24) 5-6pm.  We will, however, work with your schedule and move the meeting to a different day next week.  The sooner we hear back from you the sooner we can schedule a meeting room and advertise to students.  This would also be an excellent opportunity for you to highlight any career or internship opportunities at your company.

The Enron Derivatives II will be on Wednesday and Thursday, November 14th and 15th. The class is open to those who took Derivatives I earlier this year. Please see me or send me an email if you are interested and we will make scheduling arrangements.

Thanks,

We also received congestion for HE 5--50 mws at $74.83. HE 5 is not in the inc sheet but will be. The CISO is again having difficulties reading our bids. They have been working on this for a week.
Thanks,
Bill

We got awarded cong for hours ending 5,6,7,8,and 23 on the 21st the volumes were 50,100,100,75,and 50 respectively. We priced these MW at the market clearing price or our bid price whatever was higher. HE 5 was cut because the finals were not able the be imported in time due to ISO web site problems, all other hours flowed. The price in the inc sheet for HE 6,7,8,and 23 are $189,$189,$144.95,and $89.
Thanks

The meeting this afternoon will be delayed until next week. I am waiting for more information on UBS. So, next Thursday at 4 PM we will have our meeting with the pizza.

Group,

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

Bill

What are Tracy's thoughts on this?

This is a procedure that we received from the CAISO via WPTF and Sue Mara.  It is a draft.

It fits with a more formal procedure posted last friday but shows some detail on what parties consuming R/T energy will be charged. Basically they will be charged a combiniation of the MCP and OOM costs.

Note that CERS pays OOM suppliers on a bilateral basis within 20-30 days.  Sounds like a good market to sell to while it lasts.

Thanks,
Kathy

Kysers,

St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50. We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80. Same deal # as yesterday--#826094. If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it.

Remember, we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60

Sweet.

Group,
Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system. I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service.

Thanks,
Bill

 Bill,  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it.  It is always helpful to talk
face to face and have some frank discussion regarding   our current
business relationship.  Hopefully, we'll be able to reciprocate with a
visit in the near future.

On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data and
have come across some instances where I believe we have room to displace
gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power.  In order to do
this, we need to tighten up our real-time operations.  By this, I mean to
start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and
replacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morning
hours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some
base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our
loss will be less).

For example,  Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchases
of around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment for
amounts and times).  We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame.
So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchase
power  was available for $19/mwh.  Furthermore, there was a sale for HE
06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh.  When we enter this sale into our costing
model, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE Power
Marketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) to
cost this sale.

Please look into this matter and  call me if you have any questions or wish
to discuss it further.

Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks, 
Bill

Tim,

Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager=
 to work with both FSP and Enpower. David Poston showed the position manage=
r to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter. Dave suggested that the new posi=
tion manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAP=
S and Enpower. When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told th=
at the East desk had driven most of the development work to date. The funct=
ionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed u=
seful, with little development needed for us to implement it. The position =
manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's cu=
rrent position and report reconciliation methods. My impression of the appl=
ication was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not =
a stand alone application. Within a week after demostrating the new positio=
n manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would=
 be delayed until after FSP was in production. As a result of the FSP delay=
, I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it =
since that first meeting. I think this application (as I saw it last) has t=
he potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them.=
 This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal cont=
rol. Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the r=
eal-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP =
and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

Kysers and Mary-

ST-WBOM is long at PV parking with PNM for HE 2 through HE 5, 20 mws each hour--for Friday and Saturday. The price of the power after the parking fee is $15.50. The deal number is 826094. This deal is just hanging out there under W-BOM and should make us 80 mws long at PV on Friday and Saturday. 

Also--we are still short the two BOM pieces in SP-15 for a total of 50 mws each hour on peak-Friday and Saturday- average price of $27.60. You would have the deal numbers on this one.

Sweet.

Keoni,
I am not concerned with the improperly posted ATC's. I am concerned that our bids to relieve congestion were awarded but that the respective dollar value for those bids was incorrect. We have had problems in the past with misentry of our congestion management bids. However, in this case, the awarded congestion management bids look correct to me, and it appears that the CAISO published price is not appropriate for the amount of mws flowed. I would like to figure this out as soon as possible so that we can fix any problems that might exist on our end.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Thanks,
Bill

Jim got back to me with regards to your question on congestion.  See note

REAL TIME TRADERS,

SPS HAS MANAGED TO OVER SCHEDULE BY 100MW PER HOUR ON PEAK HOURS SUNDAY 1/20 AT PV THEIR EDDY/PV SWAP WITH EPE. Steve at EPE has agreed to a leading deal with SPS where SPS/PSCO will supply 100 mw at PV real time to EPE. El Paso already has tags out there showing EPE as the source for SPS sales. 

SPS/PSCO will supply the energy to El Paso at PV and El Paso should show it going to their system. Steve was supposed to let the dispatchers know all the details.

Les 

Group,

David Porter will be moving to the Utility Risk Management group with Enron Energy Services beginning Tuesday October 23. Please join me in thanking David for his effort in the real-time group over the past year (especially the 24-hour long shift), and wishing him good luck in his new position.

Stay tuned for a "going away" party for Dave in the near future.

Bill

Kate,
We are short 3 pieces tomorrow at $27.20, $28.00, and a piece at the ST-CALI index.

We are also long HE2 through HE5 at PV, 20 mws parked with PNM at $16.
Deal #'s are-823620, 823657--we will be out in position manager for these hours...BW

Group,

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. 

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/17/01.  HE1-6, 23-24pdt, we are 13mw short (total of 104mw).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #821995.1

Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk

Paul,
Here is an updated version of the agreement I sent to Steve on Friday.
Sorry I didn't cc you to start with. It's pretty much exactly as we discussed.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Bill

 

Group,

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter=
 months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu=
lly manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance o=
f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u=
nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l=
ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold =
energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual=
 (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel=
y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav=
e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark=
eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for=
ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat=
ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr=
oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as =
efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very=
 difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should =
look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea=
ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 =
through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B=
e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in=
 with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(=
the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a=
nd the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

Bill

Kate,
We are short 2 pieces of BOM at SP-15 7-22.
Price of $27.20 and $28.00.
We are also short 1 daily piece in SP-15 at the ST-CALI index price.

Thanks,
Bill

My apologies for the public humiliation.

Steve,

Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email. Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it. I understand we may not implement it for a while. However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down. I appreciate your time and feedback.

Thank you,

Bill

 

Group-
WWP is good to buy and sell with us again.
Have fun.

Bill

Yo!!!
It's cold, its wet, its raining. But at least in Portland we have F-15 fighter jets being scrambled over the city. Gotta love it. what's the word. Drop me a line on the cellular--(503) 887-3449.

Awww Jeahh.  It's nice to hear from you.  Ive 
been trying to get in touch with yall for quite 
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me 
know how "Things" are.  Yes, the question is 
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to "What up?:"

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your 
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.  
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,
Scott

Sean,
Bobette from "Powerdex" wants to create an hourly index out west. Do you want to take a look at this and her template and give me your feedback. Would participation in this index accomplish anything for us?
 
Let me know,
 
Bill
 
 
It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you.

John,
 
Goodness! Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse. First, I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department. I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work), and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift. One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move. Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week. So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there. 
 
I have answered a few of your questions in your email below. We can go over the others when we speak next. Thanks for the good questions.

Hi Bill - 
I read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions... First, did you get my resume and letter, and did they download OK?  I am looking forward to the interview and, assuming I do well, am anxious to get started.  So let me know about a timeline when you can, please. 

What kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron?  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it.  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency.

"Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure, to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No. 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations."  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are?  You should be able to find more information regarding RTO's on the nerc and ferc websites (national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision) 

A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost.  Do you do any trading in gas?  We do not trade gas on real-time, but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side.
 
Canada -- New Alberta Power Plant.  Do you move any Canadian electricity?  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently, though we do not schedule the energy into Canada. We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border. 

The CPUC has suspended direct access switches.  What kind of impact does this have on trading?  How does California's Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA?  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here. 

Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted $500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices.  A judge said they were "just and fair."  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor?  Yes, it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades. In short, its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW. 

Enron and PGE... There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN.  Will this have any effect on you?  To put it bluntly, will you still be able to hire from the outside?  Will the sale do anything to the $100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron?   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price. 

How close are we to having BPA's transmission system under FERC jurisdiction?  What does Enron think of that, or do they care?
Dynegy, Exelon, Entergy, Cinergy -- who are these guys?    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies (like Enron)-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions. And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon. 

"Exelon said ... it would reduce its ... 2001 estimates due to power market volatility and ... it would cut an (additional) 450 positions."   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market, or did Exelon just do a shitty job?  That would be the latter. 

SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money.  What happens if it goes bankrupt?  How does that affect Enron overall, and would it change the daily trading process?  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading, but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is. I believe it is minimal on the trading desk. 

Tell me about Qualifying Facility (QF) suppliers. This will take a while.

How will "green power" enter into your mix?  It doesn't yet. "Green power" just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good. 

"Cal-ISO's director of grid planning ... testified that the cost  (of 1500 MW of new capacity) is justified as a way to prevent power sellers' market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production.  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CA's energy crisis..."  As California creates new capacity, will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do, or will they just have more power to deal with? A long or short market is just a part of trading. For example, the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result. There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have.

All for now.  Thanks for the information. The acronyms are incredible.  It was like these things were written in a foreign language.  Looking forward to hearing from you.   The acronyms are incredible, but they all make sense after a while. 

John 

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 

I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

Bill

Thank you for the email.

Bill

We are in a lending agreement with PGE for 19 MW on light load, and 75 MW on the heavy load. You will see us short this amount in the RT position manager for 10/11

Please Buy to fill this short at the MidC, for the STNW book.

Deal # 812532.1 is our sale to PGE on LLH,

Deal # 812531.1 is our sale to PGE on HLH.

Steph,
Great to hear from you. I got a call from Scotty this weekend but have not had a chance to give him a call back yet. Enron selling PGE has had no real effect on me. It should be good for our stock price though. One can hope anyway.
Glad to hear you guys are doing well. Let me know when you guys are coming down...you can definitely stay at my place--its not big but I will have a futon for a bit longer. You may prefer the Paramount hotel--its right next door.
And my liver will likely always be in shape.

Take care.

Bill,
How is the swinging Portland ladies man?  Thought I would see how you are 
doing in light of Enron selling Portland General....are you still employeed? 
  I am sure you are since you have made them lots of money!  How is your 
place?  Any new girls?  I must say that I miss hanging out in Portland and 
causing trouble.  I am sure you have carried on the tradition.  Things in 
Seattle are good.  Scott is living on Eastlake and taking some computer 
classes.  Work for me is the same.  We will be coming to visit soon so start 
getting your liver in shape!  Hope you are well.
Stephanie

Finance is fine with the change order inclusive of Scott's comments.  Please send us an executed copy, as we are obligated to pass it on to the banks.  How will the payment of the additional $6,000 be handled?  Will the next progress payment (23.5% of purchase price, scheduled for Dec 1, 2001) be based on the new price + the "catch-up amount" ($2,850,560.30)?  Please let us know so E-Next can budget accordingly.  Thanks,

We will have a meeting on Thursday of next week at 4 PM (Pizza will be provided--finally) on JAN 24th. I hope our transition to UBS from Enron will be complete by next Wednesday. If so, we will be discussing what we hope to achieve this year and the look of the floor going forward. If not, this meeting will likely be postponed. Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Thank you for the letter and for the resume. I will be putting them in front of Julie Kearney in our HR department and will be getting the process started. I am still waiting to see exactly what the needs for my group will be, but should have a better idea in a few days. 
I will be in touch.

Scenario 1
EPMI makes a forward deal with Duke to provide its "obligation" for A/S.
Essentially EPMI is trading off its "obligation" to Duke using inter-SC
template which references the SC (Duke) that is taking on the obligation.
No energy is scheduled by EPMI, just the indication that the obligation is
going to Duke.  The energy curve is scheduled by Duke only.  EPMI can not
schedule the energy. Duke is responsible for providing the energy and
receiving the payment or No Pay.  Although, Duke has various options as to
how they will take care of the traded obligation.  Suffice it to say EPMI
only has to trade their obligation and it is then Duke's obligation to deal
with as they choose.  If Duke chooses to let the ISO provide for that
obligation then there would not be any energy or No-Pay issues.

Scenario 2
EPMI has a resource within its portfolio that will self provide the
obligation for A/S.  EPMI puts in a schedule indicating which resource, the
capacity that will be self provided, and the energy that will be bid in.
EPMI recieves the payment for the energy and any No Pay charges.  

Hope this helps.

Darren,
Could you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05?
We had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS. The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18. We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18. Both wheels were awarded at $54.90.
We should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels.
Please give me a shout with questions.

FYI -

I left a message with Rich Brueger @ MPC regarding power we resupplied at Montana System on 8/1, HE 13. I'm giving you the same information I left with him in case any questions arise in my absence. Fortunately, there is a detailed cut note in the Lotus database, so you can refer to that if I've missed the mark entirely. Out of Montana's 62 mw of choice customer load that hour, we resupplied 41 mw. Following is the breakdown of sink counterparties:

Luzenac America, Inc. - 5 mw
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. - 25 mw
Express Pipeline Partnership - 6 mw
Cenex Harvest States Coop. - 5 mw

Deals entered real time to resupply are 714148 (Buy PGE @ Mid-C) and 714150 (BPA tranny Mid-C to Montana System).

What? Is receiving an email at 1:30 too late? Just because everything is done by 10...At least NW is on the right side of the market...oh wait...their not...doh! And looks like today was a bad day to go short...but who's counting? 

How nice of her to give us such advanced notice......

We are long at MIDC for Tuesday, 10/02/01.  HE 7-22 at 25mw, #797763.1.  This is due to parking by the NW Cash desk.

Todd,
From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
 
Thanks,
Bill
 
 

Bill
 
Here is my paper.  I think I am done writing and just ned to put in the pictures and graphs.  If there is any thing else that you think I should talk about let me know.  I am sorry that it took so long to get this to you.  If you need to talk to me you can call me at 281 639 6536.
Thank you
 
Todd

<<RSVP Form.doc>>

Jeff,
I will be glad to discuss this with you in the future. However, I am on my way out the door to Pullman, WA for a recruiting trip. I will be back late on Friday afternoon or we can talk on Monday.
Give me a call on my cell and let me know what you would like to do.

Bill

Bill,

I would like to sit down and discuss the $5.00/MW charge that is being associated to each EES transaction.  Since Tim Coffing is now up here and managing our intra-month portfolio, I feel the ability to manage a retail position is better than what it was and the volatility in the wholesale market has come off quite a bit.  I would like to discuss this further with you sometime today.

Let me know when you are free.

Thanks,
Jeff

We can then suspend or inactivate these products at 6 PM. All other physical products will have already been suspended or inactivated before 6 PM CST (HE 12 through HE 17 etc.).

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thank you for the help.

Bill, if you could let me know what products you will have out there until 6:00pm that would be helpful.

The compensation issue is still under review by our management.  The T&M rates AMEC has provided for the Pre-NTP PSA are all we have from AMEC at this point.  We do not have the NTP rates worked out for Exhibits yet. The current document is still in draft form and we are considering your wording, however our management is adamant at achieving an all-in rate per hour for the NTP PSA, so we consider this to be an open issue until we see your lump sum price estimate.  I assumed your position is that 60% is "deemed" to be what I refer to as the Variable Rate in the attached document.  Mike

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment 
mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a 
summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and 
NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price 
determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the 
format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering 
Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or 
more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to 
reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category 
which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the 
attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being 
assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not 
expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for 
personnel to/from Atlanta. 

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test 
piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by 
LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

If Bill finds this language agreeable, you can cut and paste my revision and send it to the customer, with the following caveats that you must communicate to the customer:

1.  We can do the load following service under the WSPP.  We cannot commit to term transactions without an EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale Contract in place

2.  If the customer is interested, we can negotiate a more formalized contract for this service.

3.  I reserve the right for Credit or Legal to change our mind about this arrangement and require a more formal contract at any point in the future.  If I change my mind, though, I'll give everyone plenty of notice.

4.  If the customers' lawyers or contracts personnel have any questions about this arrangement, or doing business with Enron in general, I am available to meet with them by phone or in person.

Steve

THis works for me!

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin with load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  When requested, Enron will  provide competitive bids and offers on an hourly basis.  To help us provide you with the most competitive prices we can, we ask that you communicate all trades to us at least 45 minutes before actual physical delivery would occur.  We can do transactions on shorter notice, but it is more difficult to ensure a competitive price as the time for physical delivery nears.  In addition, as you may be aware, the wholesale power market can only accomodate transactions involving quantities of energy that are in whole MWs; i.e., there is no market for partial megawatts.  Therefore, each transaction must be at least 1 MW, and we would prefer, but not require, that you transact with us in volumes of at least 5 MW.

Steve here is my thoughts on the comercial language that should be in the contract

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin in load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  Enron will engage its best efforts to provide the strongest bids and offers on an hourly basis.  The timing of when Enron is informed of the PUD's positions will have a large affect on the prices received.  Enron would appreciate all trades to be communicated at or before 15 minutes past the hour for the following trading hour.  In addition, Enron can only trade integer power volumes due to the wholesale power practices.  As a result, the minimum power quantity must be at least 1 MW.  Enron prefers power volumes to be at least 5 MW.

Bill

Bill, 

Attached is a memo outlining dispatch instructions for when your guys are covering our desk this weekend.  I thought with all your new guys they might need a little help.  We have it set up so there will only be a minimal amount of work.

Also, if there are any problems, you can reach me on my cell, as I will be on-call on Friday and Sunday.  The number is (403) 620-5083.

Have a good weekend,

Mike Taylor

 

Yes...sorry about implying that you did not have approval...

So does no response mean I have approval?

Bill, your approval is requested.....

As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found about the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. 

This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions:

1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.

2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.

3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.

If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help.

Kate

Paul,
Thanks for the invitation but I will not be able to attend on Friday.

Bill

We will be having a housewarming party this Friday starting around 5:30.  We will be grilling salmon, burgers, and chicken.  Also I will be opening a double magnum of chardonnay.  If you want something else to eat or drink bring it by and we will put it on the grill or ice.  Email me if you can come and how many are coming.  The following link is the directions to my place from the office:

Paul

Darren,
Just let me know when you have time and we will set it up.
B

Hey Bill,

      Been thinking that I understand the aspects of Real Time trading on a more general scale but I am interested in leaning more of the specifics.  I would like to sit in with some of the people at your desk to pick some of that stuff up.  If you don't mind I should have some time to do this in the next few weeks.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Darren  

This is relatively irrelavent but thought you might enjoy it...of course...it is made up...just like everything else forwarded on the internet none of these people actually exist...

Lisa,

Just wanted to send this so you could look at it soon.  I'll send
another e-mail later.

All:

A more detailed version  of CAISO's MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday.  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP.

It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced).  That's good.  

I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading.

GAC

What is CAISO proposing?

First off, there are "target price" and "intra-zonal congestion management"
FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC.  The
"comprehensive" package would build off that.

In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP
proposed at the CPUC "Procurement OIR") that has an "available capacity
obligation" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and
electric service providers).  This is the solution to the "all spot, all the
time" design that was associated with the CPUC's "mandatory buy/sell"
requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the
utilities.  The LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP
resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115% of the coming
month's peak demand.  ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation,
generation under contract, etc.  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would
lead to penalties.  Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the
middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would
penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched,
etc.  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element
of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required.  Its not clear from
the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to
other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's
running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule?  

It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems
to be a contradictory statement in the paper).  However, CAISO is proposing
a two-year "transition" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP
resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??).
There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding.
Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the
terms of AB 1x.  

CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism,
similar to the PJM type of design.  It is based on a 3000 bus network model
with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas.  Dispatch will be on an
optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic)
including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are
freed up, etc.) and generation availability.  There will be some degree of
node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs).  It
appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although
that is not completely clear.

Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization
effectively removes the need for the "balanced schedule" requirement.  Under
the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the
optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO
calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for
that).  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but
that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help
shape resource needs.

CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not
already scheduled by the LSE.  They speak in terms of a "residual unit
commitment" requirement ... something akin to the "long lead time" proposal
under the "must-offer" requirement.  Their start and min load payment
proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or
participation in the market.  

Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to "locational
market power", particularly in relation to congestion.  I thought that
locational market power was addressed via RMR.  This raises the "black box"
issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some
dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the
problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy
pricing mechanism.  To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue
that more folks have "locational market power."  We'll need to review other
markets' treatment of this issue.

The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the
specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if
ACAP is put into place.  This is probably the largest hole in the paper,
because there's a clear implication that something should happen and
presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue
(i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but
expect low volume, etc).

One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response.  In
many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save
the extraordinary conservation last summer.  There is a suggestion that the
ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that
would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those
resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side
design.  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC,
it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction.

It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and
others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR.  Based on a lone comment by a
CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind
the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this
issue.  Given that the same "solution" is popping up in both venues, there
is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while
avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to
"coordinate" the venues is proposed.

Of course you were. Don't feel bad though, we all get confused at times. Some of us just more than others.

I was referring to you. But those are equally compelling examples.

"it is commonly urged that, in a war between liberals and fanatics, the 
fanatics are sure to win, owing to their unshakable belief in the 
righteousness of their cause. this belief dies hard, although all history, 
including that of the last few years, is against it. fanatics have failed, 
over and over again, because they have attempted the impossible, or because, 
even when what was aimed at was possible, they were too unscientific to adopt 
the right means; they have failed also because they roused the hostility of 
those whom they wished to coerce. in every important war since 1700 the more 
democratic side has been victorious. this is partly because democracy and 
empiricism (which are intimately interconnected) do not demand a distortion of 
facts in the interests of theory. russia and canada, which have somewhat 
similar climactic conditions, are both interested in obtaining better breeds  
of wheat; in canada this aim is pursued experimentally, in russia by 
interpreting marxist scripture.
     "systems of dogma without empirical foundation, such as those of 
scholastic theology, marxism, and fascism, have the advantage of producing a 
great degree of social coherence among their disciples. but they have the 
disadvantage of involving persecution of valuable sections of the population. 
spain was ruined by the expulsion of jews and moores; france suffered by the 
emigration of huguenots after the revocation of the edict of nantes; germany 
would probably have been the first in the field with the atomic bomb but for

disadvantages of involving false beliefs on practically important matters of 
fact, and rousing the violent hostility of those who do not share the 
fanaticism in question. for these various reasons, it is not to be expected 
that, in the long run, nations addicted to a dogmatic philosophy will have the 
advantage over those of a more empirical temper. nor is it true that dogma is 
necessary for social coherence when social coherence is called for; no nation 
could have shown more of it than the british showed in 1940.
     "empiricism, finally, is to be commended not only on the ground of its 
greater truth, but also on ethical grounds. dogma demands authority, rather 
than intelligent thought, as the source of opinion; it requires persecution of 
heretics and hostility to unbelievers; it asks of its disciples that they 
should inhibit natural kindliness in favor of systematic hatred. since 
argument is not recognized as a means of arriving at the truth, adherents of 
rival dogmas have no method except war by means of which to reach a decision. 
and war, in our scientific age, means, sooner or later, universal death.
     "i conclude that, in our day as in the time of locke, empiricist 
liberalism (which is not incompatible with democratic socialism) is the only

happiness more than the prevalence of this or that party or creed. our 
confused and difficult world needs various things if it is to escape disaster, 
and among these, one of the most necessary is that, in the nations which still 
uphold liberal beliefs, these beliefs should be wholehearted and profound, not 
apologetic towards dogmatisms of the right and of the left, but deeply 
persuaded of the value of liberty, scientific freedom, and mutual forbearance. 
for without these beliefs, life on our politically divided but technically 
unified planet will hardly continue to be possible."

Group,
We will be covering for Enron Canada Corp as stated below. All submissions will have to be faxed to the Power Pool as we do not have a working digital certificate. Call me with any questions. Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

We are looking for EPMI West real time to provide coverage for Enron Canada Corp. on Friday, September 21 and Sunday, September 23 from 7 AM to 7 PM (MPT). ECC will be looking for EPMI to dispatch the plant if necessary and to inform the Power Pool of Alberta of a change in availability. ECC will forward the real-time number to Portland and will also provide a cell phone number if you have any questions. 

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks in advance,

Bill

Here is the original email from Keoni, and the follow-up from Chris Foster.
Just give me a call with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill

It still is in the master file at 87.92. I will follow-up and make sure that
it is changed to 80.

K:

Clearly there is some weird stuff going on here.  In addition to not
getting the instructions through ADR, it looks to me like we are getting
dispatched for some strange quantities.  My theory is we have reduced
the PMAX on some of these units through formal unit outages, but the ISO
dispatch system does not communicate with the unit outage system.  Can
we check this theory for the dispatch on September 4 for Harbgn_7_units?
Your spreadsheet is showing a dispatch of 7.92 MW.  Our records indicate
that Harbor's PMax is 80 MW as we changed the PMax some time ago.  I
believe the old PMax was approx. 87 and maybe even 87.92.  Can you check
on this?  This might help explain what's going on.

Chris

If you can shed some light on the 82% Decline Count that would be
helpful.

Geir,

Please enter a few test deals on Saturday after the databases are brought back up.  There should be an EnPower stage for NETCO shortcut and an EnPower Stage for estate shortcut from the start menu in terminal server.  You will need to re-boot your system to see the new shortcuts.  The database are scheduled to be back up after 4 PM.  If they are not back up before the end of your shift, please ask your successor to enter a few deals, etc.  If you have any problems call David Poston.  (I'll be out of town due to a family emergency this weekend.)

Group,
Please remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet. Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO. Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet. This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes. Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag.

Thanks,
Bill

Jill,
Ryan Slinger previously had a plan set up. It looks like our AT&T rep switched him back to the group calling plan. Please check with Ryan and he will let you know what he needs.
Thanks,
Bill

Effective October 1st Real Time individuals will be responsible for anything over $55.00 on their AT&T bill.  As of now you all have 200 minutes per month plus free calling within your group all the time.  You are welcome to come look at recent and old bills to see approximately how many minutes you use within a month.    This might help you to choose a plan that might better suit you.  I urge you to do this soon so you are not stuck with a huge bill in October.  If you decide to go against the group calling plan you will have to remember your minutes talking within the Real Time group will be accounted for.  

I'll list some plans that are available.  If you are working at night and are not able to get a hold of me, please e-mail me with your decision and I will take care of it.

Jill,
I was being sarcastic about the $16000. Could you send an email to each group member giving them their average usage since you started or the last 3 months (AT&T should have this info). If you could send me an email breaking out the costs that would be great as well. I am not that concerned with the new phones--but would like to know what was spent.
I appreciate the help.

Thanks,
Bill

The answer to that question is NO you haven't spent $16,000 in just new phones.  Your group was going over their minute limit before I even started here it seems.  Do you still want me to go through the last bill and let you know what was spent on each individual?  I'll send out the e-mail today.  I can go through all the bills and let you know what was spent on new phones, it will take a while but I could figure it out.

Absolutely,
Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month. Let them know they can set up a different plan if they need (I would prefer they stick with the group calling plan and add minutes...but the choice is theirs).  Let's put this in effect by October. I am seeing $20000 ytd as of June in cell phone charges (and $55 x 13 group members x 6 months should equal $4290--have we really spent $16000 on new phones?
Thanks,
Bill

Yeah that's a good idea.  Some of the bills lately have been bigger then others and that is because of purchases of new phones.  The rate you should be paying right now per employee is $49.99 PLUS taxes which usually adds up to be about $53 to $55 a month.  Granted most of your group goes way over that.  I set Mark Guzman up on a plan yesterday that is 1100 min. per month and he will probably be paying about $69 out of his pocket if you want to cap it at $50 bucks.  Do you want me to send an e-mail out to your group to let them know they should come see me about different plans?    I'll give you the latest report by the end of today from your latest bill.  Also to be aware that if I put everyone on a different plan they will NOT have the free group calling. 

Jill

Jill,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

Thanks,
Bill

The BMW is of course a 1992! Priced at only $9900!!! How could you not buy it.
 

Group,

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249

EXPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1

*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*

Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.

Thanks,
Bill

Stewart,
Just a quick heads up.
SMUD used enron online today and sold ust a total of 125 mws.
Thanks for the good work! 

Bill

Darin,

I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities. I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort. A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread. 

If you have any questions, just let me know. Otherwise keep up the good work!

Thanks,
Bill

David,
I have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with Amy Fitzpatrick in our HR department. Obviously this is a loose plan (the headcount for the RT group changes frequently)...but it should prove a bit more accurate than nothing. If you have any questions please just let me know. You can call me here at work at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.
Thanks,

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Stewart,
I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st? Could they come the morning of the 19th?
Let's get together and talk regardless.

Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill -

Come by and talk to me about an opportunity starting in october 1st.  Basically, Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin would like to outsource some real time transactions to us for a short period of time until they get comfortable with SLICE.  They will probably come in for a meeting on September 20th or 21st in the morning to discuss this.  I would like you to be there for the meeting.

Stewart

Group,

A quick reminder. After reviewing this weekend, we must begin adjust bidding for congestion at ALL tie points. We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15, the COI and NOB. We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions. It is still fire season, and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions. Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site, and spend the time to manage our congestion risk. If you have questions, please ask. We need everyone up to speed on this quickly.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,
Just a quick reminder.
When we are notified by the CAISO Generation desk regarding a "waiver" for an Enron managed unit in California, we should notify the services desk if it is during the day, and should email the services desk (and me) if it is after normal work hours. If you have questions please just let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

Crystal,
Seattle was sweet this weekend. I went and saw Brad at the Breakroom...what did you think of Husky Stadium? Woohoo!
Man, Thursday...whoa...and think, I went out after that...whoa...but it was my birthday...sorry for calling late.
Are you doing anything cool this weekend?  Motorcycle dirt track races are on Saturday night at Portland Speedway...
I am stoked. Plus the first Husky football game is this weekend in Seattle against Michigan!
 
How are other things going? Hopefully well.
 
Later,

Steve,
Can we contact this Steve Johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of California... Funny...I don't remember a "near-meltdown", just inept purchasing and load balancing by CERS at the start of August. CERS is consistently completely out of the market. EVERY DAY! They can't even manage to bury their bad trades in 35,000 mws of load!
Humorous article though.

Increasingly, plants put grid at risk
POTENTIAL FOR OUTAGES 
: OPERATORS REFUSE
STATE'S REQUESTS TO ADJUST POWER LEVELS 
BY STEVE JOHNSON <mailto:sjohnson@sjmercury.com>
Mercury News 
More than a month after two generators refused state orders to deliver power as promised and triggered a near-meltdown of the Western power grid, California's electrical system continues to be hindered by a growing and potentially dangerous anarchy. 
Officials with the California Independent System Operator say power-plant operators increasingly are refusing the state's directions to adjust their plant power levels up or down to keep the electrical system in balance. Nearly one-fourth of the orders were ignored in July and August, state officials say. 
Refusals have increased steadily from about nine a day in May to more than 160 a day in August. The most serious incident occurred Aug. 2, when two power-plant operators declined to provide the power they promised. That resulted in what authorities called a major frequency drop across the West, with the potential to cause blackouts. 
Concern grows 
Although no outages have been caused so far, Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator, said state officials are deeply concerned. 
``Our operators need a certain amount of certainty when you're running a grid,'' McCorkle said. Unfortunately, ``the level of uncertainty has reached an uncomfortable level for ISO operators.'' 
Why this is happening remains unclear, according to California and power company officials. Jan Smutny-Jones, the ISO's former chairman who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents generators, said, ``It's very hard to tell'' because a number of factors appear to be at work. 
He and McCorkle agreed that the refusal to follow orders partly stems from a growing frustration by generators over not being paid for power they have supplied the state. In recent weeks, generators have gotten only about 8 cents on the dollar, McCorkle said, noting that the problem largely stems from payments coming late from the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for the state's financially strapped utilities. 
Generators frustrated 
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, also blamed the state's new portfolio of long-term power contracts. 
He believes state officials may be forcing those large blocks of contracted electricity onto the grid, to avoid admitting that they bought more than they needed. But inserting those blocks into the system can be complicated, Ackerman said, and often requires difficult-to-make adjustments by other power-plant operators to keep the grid stable. 
Moreover, Ackerman said, the state has been relying increasingly on a computerized system that sends instructions to plant operators when power levels need to be raised or lowered. However, he said, that system can't handle the number of instructions the state is sending. 
``It's like pushing your car from zero to 120 and back to zero, and doing that over and over,'' Ackerman said. ``Your car just wasn't designed to do that.'' 
ISO officials acknowledged that fitting the long-term contracts into the system has been tough. But despite some minor glitches with the computer system, they said, they did not believe it was responsible for generators not doing what they've been told. 
No fines yet 
So far, no generators have been fined for disobeying orders, said Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel. He noted, however, that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is investigating the matter, could decide that fines are warranted. 
But because California is so dependent on generators for its electricity, authorities have to be careful not to alienate power plant operators by penalizing them too harshly, said Mark Ward of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
``How do you motivate people to do the right thing?'' Ward asked. ``It's not a real simple problem.''

Nice work. Way to get after "it"!

Jim & Darren -

It looks as though the only ISO true-up information Risk received was regarding our July variance of $86,743. This does not take into account the August variances totalling approx. $42,000 in revenue we did not receive throughout the month. Fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the Short Term West Hourly book; but as you can see by the attached e-mail, Risk has only accounted for July variances, not August, in this PMA. 

I did go over the Month End Variance report Jim gave me, and I have some questions about the totals listed in it - in particular having to do with charges 253, 405, 111, and 112. Let me know when one or both of you has a moment and I think we can clear this up.

Again, I think the only variances we still have out there for the WHOURLY book are the four that occurred in August, which are as follows:

8/11 - $990
8/16 - $37,787.25
8/18 - ($6,764.68)	
8/22 - $9.495.25

As long as we're all aware of the ISO charges and revenue still unaccounted for - and know they will be in the future - I think we can all sleep soundly. Let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Per your request I have double checked Risk's daily record on ISO revenue/expenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out.  Here is the result:

Daily ISO revenue/expenses total (8/1-8/31)	+$629,709 (you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your P&L )
July ISO true up					+$86,743 
=>					total	+$716,452
Month-end August ISO revenue/expenses 	+$716,481 (we got this total from Volume Mgmt)
Variance (i.e. true-up)				+$29

I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results.  Jim advised that they might have added some items "after fact" during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the month-end flash, and that's probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you.  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

	

Guys,

We are short for HE 21 through HE 23 at Malin. We are short at $40. The sale is to Pacificorp Power Marketing. 20 mws of the 50 is going to SMUD and 30 mws of the 50 is going to CERS. You can reference tag#'s 31892 and 31889.
If you have any questions just give me a call on my cell phone.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques. We are having great success with EOL so far. For further clarification.
	

	1. ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut. For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15. The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW. The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW.

	2. ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE

	3. ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example)

	4. INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead

	5. WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days.

	6. MEETING ON TUESDAY 09/04 at 4PM

Finally, I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday. You should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449. If you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger, (503) 789-1306.

Thanks for the continued hard work and attention to detail,

Bill

Jon,
Good to hear from you. Glad to hear you are healing up, as for me, I am still working on the sprained knee. Enough of this one game and out stuff. Do you know when the outdoor season starts? I am hoping to make some indoor games, but want to concentrate on outdoor.

Bill

Hi Guys,

Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.
For more info go to 
http://www.pdxindoorsoccer.com/

As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there
before too long.  Later.

Jon 

Darren,
Per our discussion, please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group. Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books. My understanding is that Chris will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead (24) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary. All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS. If you have any questions please see me. RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges.

Thanks,

Bill

Virginia,

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.

Annuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73

Annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).

ST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.

All deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.

If you have questions, just let me know.
Thanks,
Bill

There are several annuities related to the profit sharing of this deal.
First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE =
deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my inten=
t and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal origin=
ally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to=
 ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly=
 to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #53=
1546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-=
Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part=
 of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a prof=
it of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large im=
pact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. The=
se profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for =
the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All thes=
e annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of Februa=
ry. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW boo=
k...ideas?

Questions?

Just come see me and let me know.

Bill-

  Please come see me this morning with your comments or suggestions on the =
LP deal.
  As it is month-end and we have many other things to finish by today, I ne=
ed to get this off my desk.

  Virginia

How about this?

I appreciate your patience, we will attend to this issue shortly.

Please find attached an excel spreadsheet of Bloomberg deals I can't seem to match up with our deals in Enpower.  This is for August 1 through August 22.   None of these deals have Bloomberg as the Broker in Enpower.  I was told in June to allow a two day grace period before the deals should be in Enpower and that did not occur.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help resolve these problems.

I'm back.  How was your weekend?  Still putting in long hours or is that over?  I'm pretty pissed. My five day weekend is over and I don't have any more vacation now until I graduate.  A whole month of no vacation????  Aughhhhh!  I'm never going to make it!
 
:)

Group,
EOL is off to a great start and is already becoming an integral part of the real-time market! Each person who has put in substantial extra time entering and reconciling deals deserves congratulations. I do recognize and appreciate the hard work. As always, there is more work to be done. We have had significant difficulty integrating the increased volume of EOL trades into our current business practice. Some members of the group have experienced limited success, others have experienced little to no success. A standardization in our process will benefit the entire group and will allow us to make consistent improvements as time goes on. So going forward.

	1.	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for 	example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22--all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal 	will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include 	transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.

	2. 	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for 	wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export 	fees.

	3.	A "skeleton" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.  Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and 	immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

See me at any time with suggestions or comments.

Thanks,
Bill

What do you mean adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until you do? 

Are we correct? If the answer is yes. Tell MPC we are correct, we have checked out with our counterparties (thereby verifying our incredible correctness), but..because we love them so much...we will...this time only...take it in the proverbial shorts.  Next time...it will of course...be there turn...
Good luck and thanks for your help.
B

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm?

A reminder....

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

(This looks good --though no one will know what you mean by abstruse--you might want to clear up the language regarding summarizing at the end of the deal. Make it a bit more firm and condescending)

As always, let me know if you have questions about this.

Kate

Sorry to hear about Racheal...so the Bretts weren't gay? But what about Nancy...
I haven't been to the Breakroom. I think I will be coming up to Seattle on either Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. I haven't decided yet. I am taking Friday off from work though...my birthday is on Thursday...isn't your birthday here in the tail end of August--or am I thinking of Chuck. Erica Price? from the dorms, rowed crew, tall, red hair, sometimes slightly neurotic?..that would be kind of fun to run into her, anyway...I'll get back to you when I figure out what the heck is going on.
Later.
Bill
It's at the Breakroom on Capitol Hill.  Ahhh yes, Racheal, I showed up with
a couple of friends and she wasn't there.  At about 7:30 Nancy came up to me
with one of the "Bretts" and said that Racheal got caught up in a Job for
Costco....whatever...

Erica is in town for her sisters wedding.  She might come to the Brad show
if she can make it.
========================================

Sweet.
Thanks for the call last night...Brad should be awesome.
Where is it at?
Let me know how your "evening" with Rachel goes.

Bill

Ok, I got you a ticket for Sep. 1 that is a Sat.  show starts and 9:00.

You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). Hope youre doing well.

Word.

Awww Jeahh.  It's nice to hear from you.  Ive 
been trying to get in touch with yall for quite 
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me 
know how "Things" are.  Yes, the question is 
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to "What up?:"

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your 
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.  
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,
Scott

Because we're under close watch by El Paso, would you mind looking over this e-mail to Kathy before I send it out? Thanks....

Kathy -

I requested tapes for 8/17 to verify the amount we purchased from SRP, and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power (Vanessa at SRP said she'd need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all) for HE 16-18. 40 mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at Four-Corners. Our records also show we bought 50 mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day. So total SRP purchase for HE 17 is 90 mw (50 mw lending deal + 40 mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements). 

I'm working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers - I'll let you know as soon as we find that. In the meantime, do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased 40 mw of econ energy for HE 17? I'm just not finding anything to support that.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
How do I get David removed from schedule crawler?
Could you help me with this.
Thanks,
Bill

Guys,

Good looking discussion note last night. I appreciate the good work.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,
I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE. As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units. Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.

Please call me before you call our customer.

Thanks,
Bill

Correction:
The burner problem is on Newman 3.  (Thank You! Mr Ward)   The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.  The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.    

If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down
local units.  With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak. 

Depending on load,  GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10
MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...

If  Market conditions are less than $14.00  BACK DOWN Four Corners...   As
load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!   If
there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.

Any questions or comments please call at  5808  or  915-204-1202...

Since Congressman's Ose's been asking FERC alot of questons about what the ISO, DWR, etc. have been up to, perhaps he could write a "Dear FERC" letter saying "here's what I'm hearing, it sounds serious and you need to investigate, pronto, and get back to me ASAP with your conclusions."

Best,
Jeff

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Issue highlighted in blue lettering. This is being researched internally and
an ISO response on how these transactions are being handled should be
forthcoming, I would think.

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

10.  Here is an e-mail from the intrepid and vigilant Kit Blair, in Volume Management, who first brought this scam to my attention.
Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Group,
Beginning tomorrow, August 25th, we will be scheduling for California on Saturday and Sunday. Serena has put together a training manual outlining the process. The ST-CALI group will be on call to answer any questions or to help us handle cuts. This should be a simple integration into our Saturday and Sunday shifts. Please see me with questions, and be prepared with comments and/or concerns for our meeting the first week of September.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. =
Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet ne=
ed to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost n=
ever buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2.=
 We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our abili=

the start of September.

Thanks,
Bill

Real-Time is on board and is comfortable with this...any questions from settlements?

Bill,

The DBAs for the EnPower database want to take it down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).  The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  Let us know as soon as possible if this is ok or not so the DBA's can get their plan togethre for this weekend.

Guys,

We are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.  Remember, the awarded congestion wheel caused the 10 mw variance we discussed on Monday.

Bill - does this sound reasonable? Do you have anything to add?

Please make a note of the following. I know we have several new traders, and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process. But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job. Thanks.

1. Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book. Pay attention when extending deals. If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book, you don't have energy to sell from that book.

2. Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso. Also, pay attention to detail with EPE spinning reserves (as a violation is extremely expensive for EPE), also curtail units in the right order. Copper then Newman 4 then Four Corners (Be sure to curtail Four Corners before selling under cost!)

3. El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done. Check spreadsheet formulas. 

4. El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model (m://electric/epe/epe01/aug01/epe reconciliation model) and all variances explained.

5. Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $15 FLAT broker fee per trade. If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades, enter a per-megawatt fee, and extend the deal later with bilateral trades, you're effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL. Can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn't simply multiply $15 times the number of Bloomberg trades done? huh?Please let me know.

6. Most importantly, if you are unsure, call someone who is not.

Thanks again for your attention to these matters.

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of the group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearance of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on the floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

Thanks,
Bill

Chaos,Inexperience Hobbled Power Buyers
State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders.
By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L. RABIN
Times Staff Writers

August 12 2001

It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis, when California's first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka.

Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening, trying to figure how to keep the lights on, when a speeding tractor-trailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train.

"I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising," said Ray Hart, head of the energy planning team. The symbolism was not lost on him.

The next day, with the state's electricity supply on the line and the governor's political career on the blink, Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West, purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke.

Now, seven months and billions of dollars later, the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry. Even Gov. Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch.

"It's like the Yankees playing a stickball team," he said in a recent interview. "We're totally out of our league."

The administration's new long-term contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future.

Making matters worse, nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companies--a fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements. Five were hastily fired, and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations.

"How an agency could forget conflict-of-interest codes, or ignore them, is beyond me," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "This is the way people lose faith in government."

Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in, including one from Davis' Republican political rival, Secretary of State Bill Jones.

Amid all the controversy of recent days, Hart said, the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed.

"Frankly," said Hart, a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources, "it's kind of disconcerting we aren't getting the credit we should be getting."

Patching Together a Team on the Fly

The state's new energy-buying organization was a beg, borrow and recruit operation. A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project.

The agency received an immediate infusion of $22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants.

On the fly, Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers, workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and the energy industry.

Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices. Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand.

From the start, the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms.

"Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day," a state budget document said. "It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively. Professionals in this business are highly compensated."

Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February.

"They said, 'Can you be up here Tuesday?' " said Mead, a 55-year-old former Edison engineer from Duarte. "I said, 'For a job interview?' And they said, 'No, bring enough stuff for several months.' "

They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume, Mead said. He worked six weeks, he said, before he finally got a contract to sign.

"In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage 2, on the verge of blackouts," he said. "There was no focus other than to keep the lights on." One day, Mead said, he bought 10% of all power consumed on the state's electricity grid during his 12-hour shift.

But, unlike Mead, most of the new crew had never bought power before, according to their resumes. Most worked at the now-defunct California Power Exchange, an energy trading floor similar to a stock market, reconciling sales and purchases made by others. Before that, one worked at a freight-forwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia.

Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group.

"They're just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast," said Mark Palmer, spokesman for Houston-based Enron Corp., one of the nation's largest energy marketers. "It's like someone who flies a kite one day, and then is told to go fly a 747 the next."

One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings. "You don't just come out to someone and say, 'What's your price?' and then pay it. But that's what some of them have done."

A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said, "The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them."

Palmer said California, for the salaries it's paying, could have done better.

A particular lightning rod for criticism is the $480,000, two-year contract of chief trader Susan T. Lee, 30, who was hired in April for $120 an hour.

With barely a year's experience in the energy industry, she leads a 16-person crew that buys electricity the day before it's needed or for nearly immediate use. State records show that Lee was paid more than $30,000 a month, including overtime, as she began her new duties.

"That lady's got one year's experience, and she's getting 500 grand," Palmer said. An experienced trader in private industry, he said, might make $80,000 to $120,000 in a good year, plus bonuses.

"She's certainly making double what I am, but she's worth it," said Hart, who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the once-obscure Department of Water Resources.

Although Lee could not be reached for comment, Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of today's evolving trading market. California energy deregulation began only in 1996, and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year, he said. "I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody [regardless of experience]."

Lee's team members, meanwhile, have been signed to lucrative short-term contracts worth a maximum of $15,000 to $21,000 a month, including housing, rental cars, per diem pay and flights home on days off. State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount.

One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange. He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didn't think they were qualified.

Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete.

"They know more than me; they've seen it all," said state trader Bernard Barretto, a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 1998.

In their own defense, the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost.

"Our job was to buy whatever we could buy," former trader Elaine Griffin said. "California was truly a captive market."

Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higher-ups.

"Do the [traders] go out and start the deal? Yes," Hart said. "Do they cut the final deal? No."

Far from the trading trenches, the governor sees things differently. The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources, he said.

"These are very sophisticated operations," Davis said. "They have several meteorologists and banks of media people."

To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of California's power-buying binge, state officials turned to a technique called "sleeving." They used Lee's old Long Beach firm, Mieco Inc., and Allegheny Power to camouflage the state's identity as the buyer.

The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills.

Some traders, however, saw through the guise. The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tip-off that California had weighed in.

"I knew it, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it, too," said one trader, who like others, asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state. "But it worked for a while. It helped keep the short-term prices down."

Controversy Over Stock Holdings

The state traders were powerless, however, to protect themselves.

Just as they were settling into their new jobs, and energy prices were falling, the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks. The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired.

Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firm--San Jose-based Calpine Corp.--in which they had owned stock.

The highest-ranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira, who was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to negotiate long-term power contracts.

The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers: Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng. Elaine Griffin, who had resigned just days before the firings, also held Calpine stock while trading for the state.

Most of the traders, who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra, said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem. They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares.

Mead said traders on his state team--such as Cheng, Leung and Louie--had no ability to influence Calpine's stock price because their purchases of the company's electricity were infrequent and small.

Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because he'd made so much money on it. He said his investments of $20,000 in 1999 and $134,000 last fall brought him about $400,000 when he was ordered to sell last month.

"You want to know how I picked Calpine?" he said. "Investor's Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks, and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential."

Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his $2,000 worth of shares on Jan. 22, while still at the Power Exchange, which had a conflict-of-interest policy barring ownership of energy stock.

"I didn't know I would have an opportunity like this at the time," Leung said of his briefly held state job. "I bought it just because I'm interested in the market all the time. I follow it."

Today, shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento, the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis' effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis.

They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings.

"The big boys, the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose, those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention," Mead said. "They're the ones who knew how things worked."

Jim and Darren,

We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.  We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345. This resulted in the 10 mw "variance" in the report. I have added deals to Enpower to flatten the report, these deals are only necessary for the sake of the report. The identical variance in the north and south indicates a wheel or load shift. I prefer to not enter these extra deals. Please see me with questions if you do not understand why the report variance exists.

Thanks,
Bill

Geir,

Avista put in the 100 mw sale at $70 for HE 1.  BPA and CAISO accepted the schedule.
I have changed enpower deal #727620 (SCL) to a zero for HE 1, and enpower deal #727622 (Avista) to 250 mws from 150 mws for HE 1.

Good work on getting this schedule taken care of.
Bill

Alan,
I think you have identified the most pressing issues. Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency." Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?  In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update.

Bill

	The California ISO has begun a comprehensive redesign of its markets.   FERC ordered CAISO to submit a proposal to FERC by 5/1/02. CAISO is trying to implement changes by this summer and certainly no later than when price controls terminate on 9/30/02.  CAISO's proposed changes are intended to solve long-standing problems such as the lack of price resolution (and resulting gaming opportunities) and problems purportedly related to the "crisis" of 2000/2001 (e.g., lack of capacity commitments made on the part of load). Some of the changes being considered include:

Increased price resolution via either:	
	A move to full-nodal model with security constrained dispatch (i.e. PJM),
	An increase in the number of zones, or
	A combination of the two: nodal for relieving congestion, zonal for scheduling load and pricing traded energy.
A requirement that load make forward commitments for capacity
residual forward unit commitment (for times when voluntarily commited capacity is insufficient)
Creation of an hourly day-ahead energy market.
Combining A/S procurment with CM
"Damage control" price caps

One of our key needs as an energy trading co.  is a need for the market to allow participants to enter R/T either short or long.  This is allowed in PJM.  Also, we will need to be on the defensive against the ability of CAISO to impose price controls.

Please review the attached and let me know (1) other design elements you would like to see (or not see) at the CAISO, and (2) your interest in participating in this process going forward.  Note that a more detailed proposal will be out next week and there will be stakeholder meetings during the week of 14 January.  We may not be able to get someone there in person but will definitely, at a minimum, listen in.

Kate,
We are short 25 mws in SP15 at $43 for Tuesday.  I am unsure if ST-CALI is doing anything.
We are short 25 mws at PV at @$50 with ST-SW on EPE lending for Tuesday.

Let me know if you have questions, and you may want to check prices with these desks.
Thanks,
Bill

Jim,
We recieved congestion relief revenue from the CAISO for Sunday and Monday, August 12th and 13th.
Thanks,
Bill

Bert,
When buying from any desk on the floor, you should have a sale from that desk (say ST-CALI) to either WHourly or WBOM, then do enpower as normal. The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk (another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance, sells to WHourly/WBOM, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE.
Please let me know if you have questions.

Bill
Bill:

We had a variance in the SAR for the West BOM Book on Friday night.  It was due to a 9 mw purchase from short term cali that was used to fill the lending we have with El Paso Electric.  We in a purchase from the imbalance under the WBOM Book (deal #727440), and built an annuity (deal #72741) where short term cali sold us the 9 MW @ $43.00.  If this is not the correct to remedy the variance please advise me of what to do next time.

Bert Meyers

FYI -

We had only one discrepancy between the El Paso model and the CARP report for July. Our checkout with Kathy and the Settlements group took approximately five minutes, as opposed to the five days we spent sorting it out last month. Thank you for your diligence and attention to detail in dealing with El Paso - you've made me very proud. Keep up the good work.

Thanks,
Kate

Guys,
You can find out the information you need on the website.
The website is www.wscc.com, click on certification and training, scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual.  Print off the schedulers course manual and study it.  You will be tested on the material, a pre-test and a post-test. (note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals).  You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course (this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit).

Please arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th.
Thanks,
Bill

Murray,
We tally up our exposure each day based on the California flash.  Our monthly exposure can be found at P:\RealTime\Exposure\August Exposure.
We are keeping a very close eye on it.

Thanks,

Bill & Chris,

Guys please make sure to stay in touch with Jim Reyes on a daily basis to ensure that we are keeping a net payable position with the ISO for the month.   Between these congestion relief efforts and EES A/S self procurements efforts We don't want to end up in a net receivable position at the end of the month.  At this point I think that we are underestimating expenses.  I'm not sure how much.  I'm sure based on the amount of load and an average cost per MWH we can determine what our average expense position should be and that should be the room we have to play with each day / month.

I'm not saying stop your efforts, I'm just saying we need to stay on top of the overall Net cumulative position for the month.

If you have any questions please let myself or Scott Gilbert know.

Thanks - MO 

Jim,
We have congestion revenue again for 08_07.
We moved 272 mws at $194.
Total revenue should be $52768.

Cara-

  Thanks for the forward!  Did the West Desk (especially Real Time) get this?
  Thus far, we have not been accused or charged, as far as I know.

  Virginia

Have we been accused of this from them?

Dear Customers-

Effective June 15, 2001, the Rocky Mountain Region (RMR) implemented Rate Schedule L-US1, for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services (copy of rate schedule attached).  This rate schedule was posted to RMR's OASIS website under 'Current Business Practices' on August 4, 2001.

During the month of July 2001, RMR began actively researching after-the-fact usage of RMR-managed transmission and identified some unauthorized use of transmission.  Some of you have been sent letters concerning perceived unauthorized usage in July.  you should receive those letters shortly.

RMR has discovered different causes of unauthorized use occurring within WACM and have attached a list outlining some of those causes.  This list is by no means a complete listing, but rather just what's been seen to date. 
A
 s RMR did not post this information publicly until August 4, 2001, we do not feel that we can charge customers for the instances discovered in July, but please be advised that from August 4th forward, this charge will apply.

Please do not hesitate to call me or Paul Humberson at (970) 461-7327 if you have questions or would like to discuss.  

Lynn Richardson

Thanks!

As indicated, we got that exact amount in the flash today.

Jim,
I just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night.
It looks like 28 mws at $198 and 75 mws at $223.00.
This should be at total revenue of $22,269.00.

Please see me with any questions.
Thanks,
Bill

We will be performing a new service for EES. On Monday, August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load.  LADWP will be providing the capacity (SPIN), we will be dispatched over the ADS system, and then need to call the amount into LADWP.  We need to keep track of the amount exercised.  We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well.  The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday.

Group,

When doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks, be sure to put the other desk as the Customer in CAPS.  This prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book.  Import and Export fees are typically in the nature of $5 per mm on a wheel.

Thanks,
Bill

The new column on the services sheet regards energy that we may need to market but that is not prescheduled, usually in the off peak hours...Call with any questions. Home number is 503-274-0502
Thanks,
Bill

According to BPA we are almost their on Grays. The only change is that Enron needs to report the total generator output which as indicated on the prescheduled sheet is 6Mw. One Mw is going to Grays Harbor PUD and we have no responsibility other than to report the total generator output.

I've sent to BPA on a prescheduled basis all the prescheduled so that shouldn't be a issue.

The good news is that on Oct. 1 Grays will no longer be our customer and BPA is saying they'll have a automatic system in place to record these numbers automatically by Mid August so hang in there.

After yesterdays cuts there have been some changes in the Colstrip Cut Procedures.

When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System.  We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.  If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.  The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.

1.)  Be sure to begin with a physical cut sheet (in drawer above SAR's).

2.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under STNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission fee is $2.52.  Build the transmission deal under STNW.

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc.
	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.

8.) Make cuts in Lotus Notes Cuts Database (this is the most time consuming portion of this procedure).

9.) Make notes in Discussion Forum

10.) Email appropriate groups, Kate Symes, and myself.

If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill

Geir,
Here is your interview schedule for tomorrow.

Kate,
I would be glad to look at anything you had...
B

Bill -

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment. At any rate, this is a rough draft, but I thought I'd show it to you to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

Kate

Scotty,
What's up? Checking to see if this was your email or not? Haven't heard from you in forever. Hope you had a good new year. Drop me a line and give me the word.

Bill

Very GOOD!

For Wednesday:

We're short tomorrow on peak at Palo Verde - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW. Please puchase to fill these schedules; reduce the purchases from EPE to $4 (711216 and 711225); sell back to EPE at $0. You will know you've done this correctly when the CARP report EXACTLY matches the El Paso model. Following are the details of the lending agreement:

711216 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

711224 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

711225 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak @ PV
	 25 MW @ $51

Please let me know if you have any questions. I can always be reached on my cell phone - 503-819-2181.

Thanks,
Kate

Yo!
For 7/31:

Tag is 28433.
Deals are 711170 and 711190.

Let me know if we run into any problems with these. 

Thanks,
Kate

Group,

We will have a real-time meeting on Tuesday August 7th at 4:30PM.  The meeting will run till 5:30.
We will go over Hourly EOL implementation, Cuts (yet again), new group members, and market changes.

Our baseball trip to the suite is Thursday August 16th.  Food and beverages will be provided.

Finally, reviews are coming.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

A quick reminder. The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.  As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.  We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.  Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.  Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!    Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.  If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you. 

Thank you,
B

Leslie,
This looks good to me.  Thanks for the update.

Sweet.  Just grab me after lunch sometime I spose...if that works for you.

no.  I just want to get our ideas, then decide who would be best to get advice from on Techy stuff

We can meet.  Who else do we need?  Anyone?

We can meet.  Who else do we need?  Anyone?

I would like to get this process going as quickly as possible.
Interviews on Thursday?
Thanks,

Bill -

The only 2 individuals who expressed interest are Ryan and Geir.

How would you like to run the process from here.....

Thanks!
Amy

Good morning. Hope your new year is off to a great start!

 

Thank you Kate.

Samuel -

Thanks for completing that request so quickly. Unfortunately, I received a message from Todd Bland over the weekend saying he is still unable to save deals using his own name. He called Enpower support and spoke with Nicolay, who told Todd he needed an Originator ID - are you familiar with that or how Todd could get one? Also, we have one more trader who never received access to trade under these desks: Short Term West BOM, Short Term Southwest, Short Term California. His name is Steve Merriss. Could you please add his name to the list as well?

Thanks again for all of your help.

Kate
	Hi Kate,

	Your request is complete, effective upon refresh of the EnPower System.

	 Best Rgds.

Sam -

We're once again in need of a new trader ID - Todd Bland joined the Portland Real Time group as a summer intern, and it seems he hasn't been added yet. Could we get his name added as a trader for the following desks:

Short Term West Hourly
Short Term West BOM
Short Term Southwest
Short Term California

I appreciate your help with this. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate 

That sounds good to me.
I appreciate your help.
Bill

Bill,
	Chip has said this will be done by end of business on Monday.  I will give you a status update mid day Monday as to our progress.  We came to see you but you were not at your desk.  Chip will grab you if he sees you.

Dave

Dave,
Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.
First, regarding handsets.  Each real-time desk needs 2 handsets.  Kate Symes needs another handset under her desk as well.
Also, I need to have my extension displayed on Kate Symes turret, and on each RT turret as well.  Also on Stewart Rosman's, Greg Wolf's, Les Rawson's and Chris Foster's.  I also need Kate Symes extension displayed on my turret (this is an immediate concern beyond the handsets). Her TRID is #106 ext. 3939, my TRID is #140 ext. 3730.
I will address our treatment of handsets with the group.
Feel free to grab me this afternoon before 4PM for a meeting if you still have time.
Thanks for the help.
Bill

Group,

I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner.  Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...

Thanks for your help with this.

Bill

I think you know.

Is this the only revision you'd like to see?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a [Mark Hall]   [transmission capacity]  bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we  [Mark Hall]  [will] need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to  [Mark Hall]  insure [Mark Hall]  (sic)  that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee [Mark Hall]   [or buy transmission/do a buy/resell with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.]  to fill the lending short [Mark Hall]   note-EPE will still deliver us energy at PV- , then enter a zero priced buy-resale [Mark Hall]   in enpower  to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Easy there Gentleman

So, do you mean we have to call EVERY hour?

Group,

I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.

Therefore: 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.

If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such.

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

Thanks,
Bill

Last time I checked, no one could tell the difference.
B

Last time I checked, I was not a gentleman.

Gentlemen,

After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,
Bill

Steve,
Great email! Arbitrary and capricious indeed.
More like ridiculous.

The FERC apparently has a very short memory:

1.	In its Dec. 15, 2000 Order, FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with FERC.   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov. 1 through April 26 are subject to refund?  The Dec. 15 Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability.  Otherwise, refund potential for transactions over $150/MWh would close after 60 days.  Presumably, liability for transactions under $150/MWh would close after 60 days, too.

Here is the excerpt from the Dec. 15 Order:

"We clarify that, unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the Commission.  The institution of a 60-day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff."  Dec. 15 Order at 58.

2.  	In its Nov. 1 Order, FERC said that it would limit refund liability to seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs---much less opportunity costs---to offset potential refunds.

From the Nov. 1 Order:  "However, should we find it necessary to order refunds, we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs."  Nov. 1 Order at 39.

FERC's July 25 Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding.  Arbitrary and capricious, anyone?

Steve

Alan:  Please forward to Dan Watkiss and Ron Carroll. 

**Per Tony at EPE, the following is new for 2002. I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.**

First, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.  The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP. Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.  Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the Eddy tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC. Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.

**The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo. 25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ. and can be varied by PNM each hour.**

Please ask if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Correction to COI rerate message;see direction of power flow: After the Day
ahead market ran, the  branch group COI TTC in the (S-N) direction was
changed from 3675 MW to 2450 MW for HE's 1700 through 2400 for operating day
7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest Generation Urgent
pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to run with these
values is HE 1700.  The ISO will update you of any changes in line rating
status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the Hour Ahead
Desk.

accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.  

Group,
We have purchased 50 mws from LV Cogen for HE 8, HE 9 and HE 10 at $35.  We will need to buy transmission from NEVP from Nevada system to Mead 230 and then into the CAISO for HE 8 thru HE 10.  This energy can go towards the ST-CALI and ST-WBOM short in SP-15. I will do enpower for these deals when I arrive in the morning. Remember to give NEVP 2 hours of notice-maybe even 2 and a half...Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

After the Day ahead market ran, the branch group ISO Share (PNOB) TTC in the
(S-N) direction was changed from 1407 MW to 1285 MW for HE's 0700 through

Group,

We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.

We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.

Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.

Thanks,
Bill

Heather,
On the new deal summary for 07/23/01, I changed the El Paso Electric deal #697528 price from $4 to $68. I should not receive the $25524.54 as revenue shown in the new deal summary.  Is there any way to recalculate this (or simply zero it out) prior to the morning flash? 
Let me know what I can do to help.
Thanks,
Bill

Kate,
I think we need to enter the buy from EPE flat to our day ahead sale to STSW.  Otherwise the new deal sheet shows revenue that we did no receive.
B

We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $68

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Sounds good.

Bill,
I just wanted to let you know that it's going to take a couple weeks (I think) until I receive access to the timekeeping system.  Apparently after requesting access, ISC sends back a ticket number and an FYI (below).  
As soon as I receive access I will go back for your group and enter their time, and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month.

Thanks, Jill

Your ticket number is 525114. FYI- security requests are averaging 14 business days.

Group,

I have attached the following cut procedures that should be of benefit as we move into fire season.  The sheet is very basic but spells out my expectations for handling a cut.  The most important thing to remember is to document everything and call with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

 

Group,
We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report. Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

	 25 mw @ $68

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

JMF

Great.
Thanks,
B

I fixed it, no idea where those megawiggles went

Cara,
We are short 14 mws at the Portland General System in position manager for Friday, July 20th.  HE 5 and HE 6.  Pacificorp deal #694155 is not in for those hours.
Could you look into this?
Thanks,
Bill

Kate,
EPE will be lending us a schedule for Tuesday, 25 mws at $4 at PV. The schedule will be on peak.  Similar to today.  Please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct (Friday's sheet for Monday had a duplicate 10 mw schedule in it).
Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Bill   

Apparently not.
The EPE preschedule sheet had a 25 mw lending position in...
We'll have to work with the preschedulers to get it squared away.

B

The first sentence bothers me. I've never lent anything from anyone in my life. Are all of the traders familiar with "lending agreements"? Is this enough explanation to avoid confusion on Monday?

Kate

If this works for you, please copy and paste it into your own email and send it on.

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Thanks,
Bill

Kate,
We need to move you more towards a trading support role and less of a settlements role.  Please take some time over the weekend to consider what might be helpful for the desk (ie. collecting pertinent weather information, transmission derates, day-ahead prices, congestion, historical spreads, etc.) and let me know on Monday or Tuesday what we can do.  Take your time but have a good weekend.

Bill

Tim,
Per our conversation on Friday regarding the WBOM book, I will limit spreads to 50 with a net of 25 open.  If you have any questions or have further feedback, just let me know.
Thanks,
Bill

After a year in RT...yeah, you could do it...

A position has recently become available in the Real Time Trading group reporting to Bill Williams.  Bill will be holding an information session on Wednesday, July 25, 2001 at 4:00 pm in Mt Hood for anyone who is interested in learning more about this opportunity.

  Bill, 
  
  You think I could do it?  Think you could handle me?   :)

  VA

Will do.
Thanks
B

I assume that the way to liquidate the PV length is through some sort of El=

He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish.  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch
Is Enron the New Drexel? 
By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni Will Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

Kourtney,
Just a quick heads up for the flash.
Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

Kate,
I will not have time today.  Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow.
Thanks,
Bill

I know you're busy today, but I don't want to forget to start compiling a reference manual for handling cuts. I can put something together for you to look over and add to, or I'll wait until you have a moment to put something together. Just a reminder.

Group,
	We will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).

Here is a note of things to remember:

?	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.  The plant will call with updates periodically.  Please record this information in the dispatch log.  This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.  Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log. The fundamentals site can be found at  http://albertapower/xnav/default.htm 

?	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.  That's 353MW @ $5.  Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.

?	ECC's  telephone line (403-974-6900) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours.  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line.

?	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403. 

	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.  This most likely won't happen.  In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.   [You must Login (top right hand corner) as John A. Zufferli-this MUST be done on my computer.  Click on ETS, then Submission.] - our passwords are not currently working...so... you can call the Alberta powerpool for help. You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required. Unless something changes you will need to fax the resubmission to Alberta Power Pool and have them resubmit it.  

?	If you have any problems you can reach Bill Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at  billgreenizan@epagenet.net.

	PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS!
Thanks,

Bill

I am available at any point this morning, including now.

Bill,

  I have put the $1,449.00 annuity in as deal # 692792.1.

  If you have any questions, please come see me.

  When you have a second, I would like to ask you a question or two.

  Virginia

Virginia,

I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th.  ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy.  That price is $23 per mw.  Please revise the annuity as appropriate.
If you have any questions, please come see myself or Mike.

Thank you,

Group,
Please continue our policy of NOT buying energy from or selling energy to the California Imbalance.  I do not feel comfortable with the many risks associated with these transactions at this time (financial, physical, legal, political).  Please see me on an individual basis with questions or discussion regarding this. 

Thanks,
Bill

Good morning,
Hope you had a great holiday!

Bill

 

Kate,
We are missing an ID-S from ST-WBOM to ST-CALI for Saturday.  We sold 50 mws to ST-CALI at $42.89.  This should be the same as Friday's deal #683947.  We either need a new deal for Saturday or need to make Friday's on-peak deal carry over into Saturday.

If you are changing the Friday deal you need to do it before the flash, otherwise if you make a new deal for Saturday you should have some time.

Thanks for the help.

Bill

Kate,
Good morning, hope you had a good weekend.
I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this.

I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.
John Anderson will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.

Thanks,
Bill  

Group,

We are long on Sunday.  15 mws for HE 12-20 at NP15 in PGE3 at $25.  I made the deals as DA schedules in CAPS.  I have made the purchase from the APX and the sale to imbalance (#685979, #685978).

We are long on Monday.  Shaped schedule.  Price of $35.

	HE 10:	35
	HE 11:	30
	HE 12:	25
	HE 13-17: 15
	HE 18: 10
	HE 19-21: 15

I have made the purchase from APX and the sale to the imbalance in Enpower (#685980,685981).
Schedules are in CAPS under ST-WBOM.  Templates have been submitted Day ahead.

Please make real-time purchases from the Calimbalance and corresponding sales under ST-WBOM in Enpower during real time.

Please call me with questions. 503-887-3449

Thanks,

I will be out of the office visiting CDWR, SMUD and NCPA on Monday through Wednesday.

I should be back Wednesday afternoon.  You can reach me on my cell phone if you need.

I am working on getting Nate's email.
I will try to get him to show up at indoor on Monday.
B

Let's get Nate on the team he would be great addition! Let him know about
getting on the team and if he has an e-mail address I will add him to the
team list. Have a good one.

Jon

Green Room,

Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present
an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the
move to D1.  I think better competition will be more fun, provided that
we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent
basis.  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the
Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with
a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker
and better than myself.  So for what it's worth.  D1 all the way.

Thanks.

Group,
A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.

	One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.

	Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.

Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.

Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses

Hello all,

Considering the circumstances if we don't move up, I think we should just
move
up to the first division. As a lover of european soccer, I enjoy the
promotion/relegation system. It is a great way for leagues to equalize
competition. So we should just take it in the gut and toughin' up and move
to
the 1st. It'll be fun and competitive. Maybe it'll give us more motivation
to
stay focused as a team. I'm all for it. Afterall, we deserve it. We earned
this
move. I don't want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to stay in
2nd
Div.

But this does mean that it wouldn't hurt to have a few more good players
join
us. So if you know of anyone really good, have him join.

Jon--The check's in the mail.

To the first!

Jay

Hi Guys,

Just a quick reminder that I do need to get a $50 from all of you who want
to play on the Green Room's Fall '01 Soccer Team.     The money ($670 2nd
Division or $760 for 1st Division) is due to the league by July 23rd so I
need  you to send me a check ASAP.  My address is 8573 SW Dakota Drive
Tualatin, OR 97062. The 10 games will be on Sundays from 12 -2 mostly some
2-4 games starting on September 9th.

The other issue I need you to ponder is 1st Division vs 2nd Division.  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in 2nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship (for 2 years) if we are 1st or 2nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to 1st division.  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager (nay volunteers?) and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out 1st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better.   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in 2nd or move up to 1st.  Also send me
money!  Thanks.

Kate,

This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.

B

Due to CAISO roll out of the new WEB based OASIS information, the evening
email providing Total Transfer Capabilities will no longer be sent.

On Monday, July 9, 2001 after approximately 1600 hr this information will
become available at the CAISO location http://oasis.caiso.com.

1. Select the Forecast Tab
2. 7 day Transmission usage
3. Choose the Branch Name you are interested in, or all Branches

Kristie,
 
Hello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  Brendan said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  

Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San Francisco, right?)...  

My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.

So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.

Take care.

Bill

Check this out...you should read Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis, and Den of Thieves.
Good stuff.
 
 
He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch
Is Enron the New Drexel? 
By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni Will Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

Sounds great.

Does this sound okay?

To all -

I think we're all aware of the changes made to account for the Wheelabrator outage on 6/17 and 6/18, but here's a recap just in case:

Annuities killed - 679980/679973/679991/679995/678497/678498/678495/678496

Deals changed - 650407 (changed from STCA buys Cal Imb to STWServices buys Cal Imb)
		650408 (" " ")
		650577/650580/650583/650604 (changed from STWHourly sells to Wheelabrator to 		STWHourly sells to STWServices)

Deals added - 680366 (STWServices sells Cal Imb for 6/17-6/18)
	         680347 (STWServices sells to STCA for 6/17)
	         680349 (STWServices sells to STCA for 6/18)	

For a more detailed account of the path we outlined for that day, check the spreadsheet located at P://RealTime/Kate/Wheelabrator_6-17_6-18. And let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for all of your help and patience.

Due to the relatively weak real-time market during morning hours, we wanted to communicate a strategy for dec. bidding or buying-back generation that you've sold forward.  We want to stress that this is a relatively short-term strategy.  As the weather turns cold during the late-Autumn and Winter months, the morning hours actually trade at a premium on the real-time market.

Lately, HE1-10 have been very weak real-time, ranging between $25 and $40.  We have two strategies that we would like to suggest:
Group,
We have two important items regarding the services and asset management side of our business.

First,
The CAISO has been calling repeatedly regarding outages.  We will continue to call the CAISO for every outage (including when Black Hills goes down 200 kWh).  Donna has worked closely with the CAISO regarding their new tariff and her information appears below.  It is very important that we do not expose ourselves to charges by not notifying the CAISO of an outage.

Second,
We will be working with the generators to execute buy-backs or supplemental dec. bids when market conditions warrant.  Stan has written an email to the generators also detailed below.  Stan and Chris will be contacting the generators over the next few days to review this email with them.  Afterwards the Real-Time group will contact the generators and initiate one of the two strategies when profitable.  Real-Time will retain 50% of the profits over the generator's day ahead profits.  Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

Thanks,

Bill

I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: 

(1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and 

(2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. 

If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733.  

Thanks,
Donna

1.  Decremental Supplemental Bids
We can submit dec. bids to the ISO at a price below your cost to generate.  Basically, we would be letting the ISO know that we're willing to reduce generation and actually buy the mw's from the ISO to cover the prescheduled quantity.  You are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it from the ISO.  For example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If the ISO takes the decremental bid, and the price is $30, then you make $20/MWh.   

Advantages - A relatively large upside, the price the ISO charges could actually go negative, as large as negative $91.87.  Also, you would actually be buying from the ISO, as opposed to selling to the ISO and being subject to credit risk.

Disadvantages - Ten minute dispatch.  When we submit decremental bids, the ISO has the option to either reduce or increase output of the unit every 10 minutes.  In addition to the physical problems this might create, the settlements statement you receive might be relatively elaborate and possibly difficult to follow.

2.  Buying-Back Blocks in the Bi-Lateral Market:
This strategy calls for our real-time traders to buy blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market for below your cost to generate.  This would call for you to reduce your generation, and the energy we buy-back in the real-time market would be used to fill your prescheduled quantity.  Once again, you are still paid the day-ahead price for the day-ahead quantity, but instead of generating it, you would be buying it at the price paid to buy-back the energy.   As in the previous example, if your cost to generate is $40, and you sell day-ahead for $50, you make $10/MWh.  If we can buy-back the energy for a price of $30, then you make $20/MWh.   Additionally, if we do buy-back the energy, we will need to simultaneously submit incremental supplemental bids to the ISO to remain compliant with the FERC order.  Then, if the ISO takes the incremental bid, you can generate the power and sell for additional profit. 

Advantages - No 10 minute dispatch (unless a supplemental bid is accepted).  You would know exactly when and for how long the unit would be down or reduced.  Also, the settlements statements would be relatively easy to manage.

Disadvantage - Not as large of an up-side as decremental bidding.

At this point in time we would encourage you to start with the strategy #2, buying-back blocks of energy in the bi-lateral market.  Once you and our real-time traders get comfortable with the operations of the strategy, then we should move forward and start submitting decremental supplemental bids to the ISO.  We propose a 50/50 profit split, above your day-ahead profit, earned from either of these two strategies.

If you have any questions or comments please call myself or Chris Foster.

Stan Cocke

Donna,

This brings us back to the age-old question.  During an emergency, how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is?  Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase.  The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's (LDWP, SMUD, etc.) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion.  And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty, and another counterparty for a "do-over" (could be assessed)?  

We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages.

Thank you for the information and the follow-up.

Bill

	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its "Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference." Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or

The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible. 
 
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay.

Group,
Volume management needs us to create customer finals by 3AM each night in CAPS or FSP.  The details are below.
Please see me with feedback or questions.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

With the new system, we need to rework the timelines of some jobs that pull data in.  The creation of Customer Finals must take place prior to our pulling in the schedules to create our estimates.  I am requesting that you implement a 3:00am deadline for Customer Finals to be created.  We will run our job at that time that pulls in schedules.  If the Customer Finals are not created by 3:00, then our job will be run again at 5:00am.  We understand that there are special circumstances that arise and we can deal with those on a case-by-case basis.  This is vital for us to have the finals created in this timeline and makes our lives much easier!

If you do not have any problems with this, please pass on this request to the rest of the RT team and implement this timeline on tonight's shift.  Otherwise, please discuss with me and we can work w/ Pete to square this away.

Thank you for your attention to this, I appreciate it!

SC Settlement Contacts:
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Draft Statement File Specification (V13.1)

ISO plans to make some minor changes to the Settlement Statement Files
related to "Soft Price Cap for  Ancillary Services", described as follows:

Soft Price Cap for  Ancillary Services

Problem Description
Last December, ISO implemented the Soft Price Cap scheme that established a
soft price cap for both energy and Ancillary Services (A/S).  Bids above the
soft cap, if accepted, would be paid as bid (subject to review and refund),
but would not be able to set the Market Clearing Price (MCP).  The soft cap
was set to $250 initially and then changed to $150 in January.  In the
subsequent FERC Orders dated 4/25 and 6/19, FERC has established new price
mitigation schemes.  However, the underlying mechanism of the soft price cap
scheme has remained the very much similar.  The only difference is that the
soft cap becomes a more dynamic number under the more recent schemes.
The soft price cap for energy is processed automatically by ISO's Settlement
System.  For A/S, a manual process is being used.  When an A/S bid at above
the mitigated price cap is accepted, it receives two payments: one at MCP
and another that accounts for the difference between the bid price and MCP.
Currently, this surplus payment is calculated manually and appears as a
manual adjustment in the SC's statement file.  The corresponding allocation
of such surplus payments to the market also appears as manual adjustments in
the other SCs' statement files.  The manual process is labor intensive, more
prone to error and creates a large number of manual adjustments that are
difficult to track.

Proposed Solution

ISO plans to automate A/S Soft Price Cap scheme.  Once automated, the
accepted A/S bids will receive only one payment whose price is the higher of
the bid price and Market Clearing Price.  No manual adjustments will be
needed.  The entire payment will appear in the Day Ahead Ancillary Services
Due SC payments (charge types 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) or Hour Ahead Ancillary
Services Due SC payments (charge types 51, 52, 54, 55 and 56).

The Ancillary Services cost allocation (charge types 111,112,114,115 and
116) will be calculated using a weighed average prices for the service
instead of the MCPs.

Settlement Calculations

For Day Ahead (DA) A/S Due SC payments, the price will be given by:
Price = max (Bid Price, DA Zonal MCP of given service)

Similarly, for Hour Ahead (HA) A/S Due SC payments,
Price = max (Bid Price, HA Zonal MCP of given service)

For A/S Cost Allocation, the unit price of A/S obligation is currently
determined as follows:
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAMCP + HAQ*HAMCP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAQ = DA procurement target in the subject DA Region
HAQ = Incremental HA procurement target in the zones that make up the DA
region
DAMCP = MCP of the subject service in the DA region
HAMCP = Weighted average MCP of the subject service in the zones that make
up the DA region

Under the new scheme, the MCP terms in the above equation will be replaced
by average procurement costs.  Thus,
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAP + HAQ*HAP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the DA region
HAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the zones that
make up the DA region

Settlement Statements

There is no change to the settlement files structure.  The meaning of
several fields in the Ancillary Services Detail File have been modified
slightly.  These changes are explained in the latest draft of the ISO
Settlement Statement Files Specification - Version 13.1.

Implementation Timelines

The change described above will take place in the Settlement Statements
beginning with trade date 5/29/2001, on which the FERC price mitigation
scheme (as described in the FERC 4/25 Order) took effect.

Attached for your review are:

- Draft Settlement Statement File Specification (V13.1); and
- Draft ISO Charge Matrix for Automated Charge Types (V13.1).

There is no structural change made to the Settlement Files.  Only the
definition of several data fields have been changed.

Kourtney,

Per our conversation, ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2, HE 23 and HE 24.
All congestion revenue was across Path 15.  All revenue was at $248.
Volumes were as follows:
	HE 2		8 mws
	HE 23		38 mws
	HE 24		30 mws
	HE 24		20 mws

Total volume was 96 mws at $248, revenue should be $23808.
Please see me with any questions.

Thanks

Guys,
Great job on the cong last night but the EPE reconciliation sheet was not done.  Even if there are no variances, please complete the July EPE Reconciliation sheet going forward.  Houston will assume that no one ran the CARP if the sheet has no entries.

Thanks,
Bill

Nice Job!
Looks good!

Good afternoon -

I wanted to quickly follow-up to make sure everyone is aware of the new EPE Reconciliation Model's location and status. I just skimmed through the first 8 days of this month, and we show no variances between the Real Time El Paso model and our CARP report. 

The reconciliation model can be found at:

	m:/Electric/Epe/Epe01/July01/July EPE Reconciliation

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kate could you check with the trader on this.  I really don't care if it is in or out.  Let's try to wrap it up before or after the meeting.
Thanks,

Good point Bill.  Now that we are sure what happened to #549162.1 is correct, I am following up with Settlements group in Houston regarding the other side of the deal, i.e. #549160.  Somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them, but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty.

-Fran

Fran,
If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Thanks,
Bill

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Thanks Chris,
This sounds good.

After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re: unit outages.  We need to communicate with 2 different groups:  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk.  First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk.  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk.  That phone number is 916/351-2488.  When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned.

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.  Services will communicate outages to Real Time.

Thanks

Chris

Virginia,
We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.  The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.  I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.  Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.  Fran is aware of this.

I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.  This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.

I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
The risk sheet is on my desk.

Thanks, 

Bill

Good morning,

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMI_CISO_BLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

Thanks,
Bill

We could pull tapes?  Ask the person who did the deal?  There is nothing in notebooks.  Any word on the BOM PMA?

Bill-

  Can you think of any other means to find out if this deal that we have in the system is good?

Dear Settlements Coordinators,

  I'd like to ask a favor...
  Could you guys please check your counterparties to see if anyone has a dispute on 3-14-01 regarding a purchase or sale of 40 MW at HE 3? 
    

   Sincere thanks,

  Virginia

As of today, the marketing personnel will no longer be on call on the
weekends.  The 5808 extension will be forwarded to Enron along with the
5872 extension.  There will be no preschedules or unit commitment plans
developed over the weekend.  Such preschedules and unit commitment plans
will be generated on Friday or the day before the holiday until further
notice.

Please call me at 915-543-4335 or Pete Serrano at 915-543-2045 if questions
arise.

Please share this with other personnel as appropriate.

Chip,
I need to have a tape pulled for Ryan Slinger on July 3 at 14:40 and 14:45.  Let me know when you have the time and I will go up with you to pull the tape.

Eric:
 
    Could you please tell us what the maximum temperature of cooling water
at maximum ambient temperature will be?  Could you also tell us what the
minimum temperature of cooling water at minimum ambient temperature will be?
We'll need this fairly quickly to design the generator for this job.  Your
help is greatly appreciated!
 
    Thanks!

Stewart and Paul,

I have heard that MPC has contracted with Avista to do their load balancing. Has anyone contacted MPC to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future. MPC is likely month-to-month with Avista as they were with us. Has there been any progress with EPE? What are your expectations for retaining them? Of all our service customers these would be the only two I am truly concerned about getting back. I think we have seen significant revenue from both, more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there is anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Bill

You are invited to an Employment Law training for Managers on July 12 from 1:15 pm to 4:30 pm at 2 World Trade Center (2WTC) - Mezzanine 5.  Managers from EBS - Portland will also be attending.

The training is sponsored by Enron's Fair Employment Practices Department and will help Enron's Managers and Supervisors better manage the daily employment decisions and risks. You will gain a better understanding of the laws and regulations that define your individual and organizational accountability. This training will address the complex realms of employment opportunity, unlawful harassment, discrimination, retaliation, as well as aspects of selection, promotion and performance management and corrective discipline.  In addition, this training will discuss roles in managing risk - keys to supervisory success - some basic information on privacy obligations and some discussion of key HR policies.  

Please RSVP by emailing or calling Grace Rodriguez at x8321.

Thanks!

Jim,
On Tuesday we sold the CAISO replacement reserves at Malin for HE 15 and HE 16, then HE 18 through HE 22.  We were exercised for the first 40 minutes of HE 15 (for the last 20 minutes of HE 15 our energy was uninstructued and we received the dec price).  For HE 16, and HE 18-22 we were awarded the capacity payment but were not exercised.  The capacity payment should be at least $91.86 for each hour it was received.  If you have questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill

Group,

When doing swaps please use the swap function in Enpower. Do not enter annuities anymore for financial deals. Be sure to specify whether you are buying or selling index and then what index you are selling (NP15 inc/dec...etc).  An example appears in the attachment.  Swaps have caused disputes that have dragged on for months in the past, so call me with any questions.  
Thanks,

Bill

 

We will pay APS losses of 1 mw for HE 1 PDT only on July 4th.  Lisa has made the tag and put the losses in the preschedule sheet.  Kate has made the enpower for this deal (#672781, and #672785).  Please put the price in for deal #672781 (buy from EPE).

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

Two totally different issues for you.

First:  When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.  We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.  We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.  Easy.

Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.  We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.  It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.  Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).

Thanks for your attention.

Bill

Fran,
If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Thanks,
Bill

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.
Bill

Thanks for the update.

Bill,

We are trying to get a hold of a FERC staffer today but we may not get clarification for a while.  I am also talking with Yoder about what to do in the interim.

Alan Comnes
Alan,

According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

Bill

A fast way to see the MCP is under Energy Prices at http://www.caiso.com/.
You'll notice that in hours 15, 16, 17 and 18 yesterday the MCP was set by
the proxy price when we were in a Stage 1 then 2 Emergency.  Other hours
were set by the previous Stage 1 cap.

Steph,

Good morning! How are you doing? It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever. Things are going well here in Portland. The bankruptcy of Enron has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity. If we are bought out, we should be back up and running by early spring. Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again. Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast. I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping. I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there. I am thinking about coming up for New Year's... any good ideas?
 
Anyway, hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays.
Take care,

Bill

Crystal,

Good morning. Haven't heard from you in forever and unfortunately did not get a chance to respond to your last email.  Just wanted to say hello and wish you a good Fourth of July!

Virginia,
I also had a question on a PMA from January.  On TransAlta deal #509285, your notes indicate that mw volumes for HE 23 and HE 24 were reduced by 95 mws each hour.  Enpower and the inc sheet do not reflect this change.  The PMA indicates a charge of $42750 for a reduction in our purchase from Transalta.  Why would we receive a charge for a reduction in purchased energy (ie. less money from us to Transalta)?  There is no indication of a reduction in volume on the other side of the trade (sale to Sempra-Deal#509277). Please come see me when you have a chance.  I think we need to go through this.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.  The oasis site map is http://www.nwoasis.org/OASIS/NODE
The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t)

Leg 1. PACW to ENPR
Leg 2. ENPR to BOBR
Leg 3. BOBR to PATHC
Leg 4. PATHC to PACE
Leg 5. PACE to FC3

We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
Please see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill
As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.

Enjoy,

Slinger

Dave Perrino will be providing us a presentation on losses during the second week of July (tenatively scheduled for the 11th at 4PM).  There is some math/electrical engineering involved. I have attached the presentation that Dave will give.  Please take about 10-15 minutes to get familiar with the presentation and prepare your questions. 

Thanks,

Bill,

Attached to this message is the presentation I am prepared to share with your real-time traders.  Please let me know when you'd like to reschedule me to make this presentation.  

As we discussed a couple weeks ago I have other ideas relating to power systems operations that you may find benefical to share with your trading group.

Kind Regards,

Dave

 

D'Ann,
This needs to go to Bill Williams, not Bill Williams III.  The difference is subtle but is rather important if you want the correct person to receive your message.

Hello Everyone,

Here is the PSR for the week of July 2, 2001:

 

Thank you,

D'Ann Gordon

Group,

Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO, the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap.

1.  The current price cap is $91.87.  We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap, however we can (and should) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers.

2.  The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load (greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled).  Despite the CAISO's repeated protests (and the IOU's complete disregard of this order), WE can expect to be subject to this penalty.

3.  When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls.  These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack.  Therefore when power supplies become tight, the prices in the "expost" may actually drop.  We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible.

4.  We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market.  The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings, and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market.

5.  Remember to include CAISO export fees, Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges.

We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt. Hood.  We will discuss other changes in the market at that time.  Please make plans to attend.
Thank you,
Bill

Jeez this gets old

Good Afternoon,

I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed the 10 day parallel test milestone for FSP.  We were also seeing solid performance for our key metrics during the parallel (template writing 1:30 - 2:30, finals processing 5-7 minutes).  Lastly, based on my understanding of our go-live bet, my total debt owed to Tim Belden = $13.00.  Tim, I gave the money to Debra.

What Next?

User Training
I will be working with the DA & Real time guys to make sure everyone is up-to-speed with the new system.  We are also in the process of developing some user documentation cheat sheets to help in the transition.

Production Parallel
We have already begun using FSP in parallel in production by writing templates in FSP & comparing them to CAPS.  We will continue doing this until we are getting consistent results between the two systems.  This production parallel has necessitated some changes to the existing Enpower_to_CAPS report that we have already started modifying.

How long? 

Once bit, twice shy.  No money on this one, but I don't think it should take over a week to train the users.  The production parallel may take a little longer.  I am really relying on the users to wrap this one up.  Kysa Alport has already volunteered for this duty and I spent a good part of today training her.  

Thanks,  David Poston  

Nikki,

Good afternoon, How are you?  Hope everything worked out in LA.  I don't know if you are still coming up to Portland but I was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at PGE Park (the minor league baseball stadium up here) and figured I'd pass it on.  The picture was taken in the Enron suite at the park, I am the one directly in front of the TV.  The rest of the folks are from the Origination (not Trading) side of Enron, except my boss, who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it.

Portland has been nice the last couple days, though its been raining like crazy.  I went up on my roof last night, the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through.  Beautiful night.  The sun had already gone down below the west hills, but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place.  There was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head, and all around were low menacing storm clouds.  A stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain.  Amazing.

It should be a nice weekend up here.  In fact, I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf.  I am playing an hour north of Portland on a links style course.  If its a clear morning, I should be able to see Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Adams.  It is an interesting course to play.  Now if I can just get the ball to go in the hole I'll be happy.

Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall.

I will be out of the office for 06/29/01.  I can be reached on my cell phone at 503-887-3449 if you need anything.

Heather,
We had some double deal-entry last night under the ST-WBOM book.  Consequently I zeroed the following deals out this morning after receiving the DPR and running a BOM SAR.  The deals are as follows: 665907 (buy from imbalance), and 665913 (sell to PowerX).  The extra sale to PowerX provided the excess $10,875 of revenue.  I apologize for our mistake.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Go ahead and order everyone in the group who wants them the new phones.  Those Eriksons are constantly breaking down.  Let's get ahead of this curve.

Thanks,  on another note ....... Can I order a new phone for Craig Dean and Eric Linder?
I don't know if you recieived my other msg. regarding their phones.  Let me know so I 
can get the order in.

Very well done Jill.

I called and put in the order for your headset.  I told them to send it ASAP.  

I also called about the little wall problem.  Maintenance is putting in an order
for someone to come fix it after hours.

I would be TOTALLY thrilled if you could let the group know...now about those MPC numbers...we need to go through the inc sheets and service sheets from last year...and we have half an hour.
B

Thanks for letting me know. I guess the point I need to make is that the people who need the sheet are still not getting it - namely, Brooklyn Couch and Ainsley Gaddis. This can be remedied by sending the sheet to EES Power Settlements. Would you mind if I let the group know that? 

Kate

Yup.

These guys filed a bunch of complaints against Sempra too, back when Sempra owned the plant.---sch

Duke's Calif Whistleblowers Have History Of Grievances  Updated: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 07:36 PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Three former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy (DUK </investments/quotes/?symbol=DUK>, news </investments/news/?symbol=DUK>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=DUK>) ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant, including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination, the men told Dow Jones Newswires. 
Most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant's previous owner, Sempra Energy (SRE </investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant. But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Duke's profit-centered management style in the deregulated market. 
Duke has called the employees' allegations about its operating procedures "baseless." Duke has said the employees have an "ax to grind," because they weren't hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDG&E's workforce. 
The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers, who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging. The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives. 
Glenn Johnson, 52, a mechanic at the South Bay power plant, alone filed 30 complaints. On one occasion, Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos. He also has a harassment complaint against SDG&E regarding an employee who now works for Duke, but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it. 
Aside from the formal complaints, Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment. 
"This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business," he said. 
One of the other employees, Jim Olkjer, 56, a former assistant control room operator at the power plant, filed three complaints against SDG&E while Duke operated the plant, because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision. The grievances were either turned down or settled, he said. 
Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldn't be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April. 
"I'm on a fixed income now," Olkjer said in an interview. "I can't afford my utility bills on a fixed income." 
The third employee, Ed Edwards, 42, a certified power plant mechanic, said he filed one complaint against three SDG&E employees in 1999 for racial discrimination. One of the employees was hired by Duke. That case is still pending. 
Edwards, an African-American, said Duke didn't hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees. Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDG&E were replaced with white employees when Duke took over. 
Edwards, who stopped working at the plant in February, said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson. 
"I knew I wouldn't be hired," he said. 
Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDG&E with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
SDG&E spokesman Art Larson wouldn't comment on the allegations. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and "always hires the most qualified employees." 
In 1999, Duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the U.S. Department of Labor for $769,700, in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions. 
Dissatisfaction With New Priorities 
The former employees said they weren't motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state. Johnson first alerted the media about Duke's behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers. 
The employees each earned about $1,000 a week. 
All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down, tossing out spare parts, and operating machinery when it was broken. Olkjer said he saw the plant's output reduced during the worst power emergencies "at least 50 times." 
When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him, "It's none of your business." 
The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff, and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant. 
"I was paid to twist wrenches," Johnson said. "The last raise I got two years ago was 2.25%. That's an insult to my skill." 
Duke said it is bringing the former SDG&E employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245. The workers were previously represented by another local, and Duke wanted a single contract. 
Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the company's "gluttony and greed." He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant. 
Johnson, Edwards and Olkjer said "in the old days" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down. But as soon as deregulation became law in the state, things started to change. SDG&E would also vary the plant's output, but not as dramatically as Duke did, they said. 
"To the best of my recollection, we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time," Edwards said. "Once Duke took the reins, that changed. We were no longer a family." 
Duke has said that it adjusted the plant's output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. 
The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid, and the employees who testified weren't in a position to know the whole picture, said Bill Hall, vice president of Duke's western operations. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan. 16-18, the period cited from the control-room logs, to keep supply in balance.

Oi!
 

Kate,
Need your help with MPC

Al,
I can be a reference for both Eric and Steve.

Thanks for the information.  Are you willing to be reference for them?

Al
Alan,
I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you.
Eric Linder and Steve Merriss. Their home numbers are 503-753-8716 and
503-241-3729 respectively. Both had worked for me for about 8-9 months.
These are the only numbers I have for them as their cell phones have
been canceled.

Bill

Yup.

 

Cheeky?

Don't be cheeky.

No There.

Here -

Arthur Anderson is an outside consulting firm hired by Enron to keep us on the 'straight and narrow' they audit many of our risk functions and other information as double check that what we say is happening is really happening.

I have been told by people higher up in risk to NEVER question Arthur Anderson.  BUT,  I would encourage you to E-mail Tim Belden or Stacey White and ask them these same questions.  You need to be as comfortable as possible.

Cara -
When you get a moment, could you tell me what this Power Audit is for? Does Arthur Andersen work for us? That was my impression, but Bill asked and it occurred to me that I might want to know exactly who Tatiana is and why she wants this information before I start handing it out.

Let me know what you know.

Thanks,
kate

Tatiana,

I have looked up all 5 of these deals in the system, and need to refer you to the following people for follow up
Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
      Deal # 566541.1

These deals are all West Hourly deals, and can be researched by Kate Symes, our real time coordinator.

Deal # 514141.2
      Deal # 536771.2

These need to be handled by someone onthe East desk,  514141 is a Long Term New England book deal, the other is an East Desk real time deal.

Group,
For 06/28 only:

We need to send APS losses, 2 mws for HE 1 at 4C345 from EPE.  Lisa Gang has put this in the sheet and made a preschedule tag.  We need to make a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower, and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower.  Please make sure this schedule is in as losses.  You can call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill

Enjoy.
B

 

Nikki,

Hope you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago.  I have been planning on visiting him for a while.  I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down.  Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home.  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice.  Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think).  So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit.  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off.  So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time.

Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around).  I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd.  Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway). 

I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt. St. Helens on my bike instead.  It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up.  St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains.  We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains.

So work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to.  No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do?  

Anyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland.  Oh.  And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do.  Brendan's got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you.  I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well...Brendan should be able to fill you in.  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture.
Enjoy your time in LA,
And take care.

Bill

Hey there Bill!

Ok an update and a little explanation.  I'm sorry I couldn't write you
yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients.  But I'm writing you now.  I
just pray that I won't get too busy today!  That probably won't work all
that well since I'm here and not at church where I should be!!!  Catholics
are funny about that stuff.  Yep,  I'm the "good little Catholic girl".  My
mom's a first grade Catholic private school teacher, my dad used to teach
CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and
confeesion on Saturdays.  It doen't always work out so well if you know what
I mean.  I took a Sunday shift today didn't I?

Anyhow... the POrtland trip.  Let me share with you the dilemma.  Ok I set
aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation.  That money is
currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral
in LA.  Also my family members (the son of the one who died) was coming up
to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive
restraunts etc.  So that probably won't happen.  But basically it's the
first reason.  I don't know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane
ticket plus any other details food, funeral flowers/gifts, etc. and still
get to go to Portland.
Plus I'm moving in a month so I'm going to have moving expenses as well!
Ughhh!  I want to go soooo bad!

But things all happen for a reason.  It looks like I may not be able to go
but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket.

Aprox. 3 hours later............

Well I just got off the phone with you, so you actually know all about the
about issues above.  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you.
You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour!  WOW!!

I don't think I can send my picture on this computer.  I'll try but it may
not work.  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think I'm an ogre (is
that spelled right??).  I tell you what... I'll send you one if you send me
one.  Deal?  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the
other person looks like that you are talking to.  Then again some people
look better in pictures than in real life.  I'm not fortunate enough to be
one of those!

Geez... we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I don't
really have anything to say.  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it
because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to
reference this!! :)

Oh well saved by the bell....a co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch!
He really is a sweet guy.  I'm not sure but I think he's a little slow.
Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do
the filing and patient transport for me.  He is such a nice guy!  then today
he knows I'm moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in
to bring me lunch.  Awwwh!  I am going to miss alot of people out here.

You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit.  Any ideas
when that might be?  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you
that oyu have extended to me.  If you are in my vicinity you are more than
welcome to stay with me and I'll show you around.  Unless of course you are
coming out soon then it would be more like ...."ok we are two lost tourist."
I would love to see alot of the LA things!  Sunset BLVD., Universal Studios,
all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area!  I hear
they are fabulous!!!  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around I'll be well
versed in "the places to be".  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the
Wishire Regency Hotel.  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet!  Complete
with chocolate covered strawberries!  Yummm.

Oh I am a fanatic about desserts!

I better not keeping Lee waiting!  He's figitty!  Talk to you soon!!

Nikki

Group,
We are long 25 mws on peak for 06/27/01 in SP-15.  This should be in CAPS under ST-WBOM, deals should be under ST-WBOM in Enpower as well.

Bill

Any word?  We need those cards and passwords...

I'm gonna call Greg Ford right now. 

Chip,

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?  All your help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Bill 

Karen,
You must change your e-mail list for Bill Williams.  Please send this to bill.williams@enron.com.  Not bill.williams.III@enron.com.  Subtle difference.  But if you consider your information worthy of review - please make the e-mail change.

Jason,
Good afternoon. I am contacting you regarding activating a pass to the Employee Store. I did product testing for you in late spring (for soccer). I would like to activate the pass for tomorrow, December 14th, if possible. I recognize this is short notice but if this would be possible please give me a call back at 503-887-3449. I would like to have my parents attend as well. Their names are Bill and Joy Williams. I appreciate your help.

Thanks,

Bill Williams 

Steve,

Good looking notes this weekend.  Both notes were very informative and detailed.
I appreciate the good work.

Bill

Group,

A reminder.

My email address is bill.williams.iii@enron.com.  Bill Williams III needs to appear in the outlook box, otherwise I do not receive the email.  I should be copied on the EES sheets, and any cut notes to volume managament, the services desk, or other traders.

Thank you for making this correction.

Bill

Nikki,

Hello, how are things going?   Hope you've caught up on your sleep from California.  That's what I am going to work on this afternoon so I can enjoy the weekend.  I am so glad the week is over.  I am exhausted.  Nothing like if I had worked 92 hours though.  

Sorry to hear you only have the night of the 3rd open.  Hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of Portland than just one afternoon.  There's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon.  As for where to stay, there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport, or you can stay downtown.  I can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as I will not be working on the 4th of July.

Give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend.

Bill

Group,

CAPS will be down from HE 20 through HE 1 on Saturday morning.  We will have to use workspace and run Enpower to CAPS after HE 1.  We may want to run Enpower to CAPs early (or at least create finals) so that we do not lose any data if the whole thing gets erased.  Please call with questions.
Good luck.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Following up on our conversation outage announcement below included an application your group relies upon, known as CAPS, or Enpower CAPS.  The outage will make CAPS unavailable from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Portland Time this evening.  I understand that group will have access to a back up interface but may be without reporting which is available on your Terminal Service version of the power scheduling here in Houston.

I will find someone on the team performing the maintenance to call (800) 684-1336 and let your staff know that the system is back online.  Thanks.

John,
We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy.  We bi=
d $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap.
We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue=
 to do so.

Bill

Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, beca=
use MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our=
 existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time gro=
up that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficult=
y securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Ch=
oice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to=
 any length resulting from MPC's "domestic" load Energy Imbalance.  In othe=
r words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during t=
he hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same =
time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bull=
ish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of=
 late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positio=
ning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expe=
cting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to=
 see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable posit=

the problem.  In the meantime, thanks again to you and your staff for the o=
utstanding performance thus far in dealing with MPC.   John

Alan,

I just received this from our client rep detailing their position.
As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net.  
I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary.  If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order, we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC (or you) recommends it.

Thanks,

Bill

Bill, the $108.08 price you see in Footnote #3 of the e-mail titled CAISO
Notice: Correction of FERC June 19 Order Market Notice is the highest hourly
ex-post price during the last Stage 1.  The $91.87 price is 85% of $108.08
per the FERC Order.

The last Stage 1 occurred on Trade Date 5/31/01, HE 10 and 11.  A Stage 2
was in effect from 1132 - 2215.  See
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/08/8a/09003a6080088aa7.xls , 2001
Emergency Detail tab.

The Hourly Ex Post Price can be found in OASIS under Button 29, Ex Post
Market Information on the CAISO Website. The Order indicates that the price
should not include a Stage 2 and 3 and even though the cancellation notice
of the Stage 1was not until HE23 we are going by the strict definition of
when the Stage 1 was actually implemented.  Hope this helps.

Mr. Kuehn...
I like the BridgePort idea, unsure about the Food idea at ZOOP.  What did you have in mind?  Nate Stanton gave me a call today...we could invite him and folks from work...either way I am cool...also bear in mind that my place has no furniture...
JOY!
B

Billy Williams,
re. Thursday summer solstice,
1.  I can stop by Bridgeport and get two growlers, and pick up some food at
spans.
2.  what time should we start?  I am available ~6:30
3.  should we invite people from work, or keep it "real".  I am impartial.
Later,

Good Afternoon FSP users,

We have just finished a comprehensive FSP rebuild & testing phase for the next release of FSP.  The rebuild should address all the issues raised in the previous go-live as well as some additional capabilities for robustness.  Please note that we have already executed several hundred different test case scenarios & performed some stress testing using data before the Enron collapse.

What we need now is help from you to continue to identify enhancements and/or bugs with FSP so that we can go-live with FSP once the new company starts trading.  Susan Amador will be available to help in any testing.  You should probably also coordinate with her when you are about to start testing so that our continuing testing doesn't interfere with your testing.  PWRTESTN & PWRTESTP should be all setup for your use.

Here are some of the bug fixes & enhancements we have rolled-out with this latest release:
1.  Bid Curve - Ability to bid on zero volumes (for import, export, and wheels)
2.  Rebuild of all FSP application utilizing Direct Oracle Access components for faster database access & higher reliability.
3.  Bug Fixes on database commits to eliminate database "deadlocks".
4.  New aggregation scout to "stream-line" the template writing process & improve template writing performance.
5.  SQL tuned "Hour Ahead" template writing.  Confirmed performance of 1min 30 seconds on heavy transaction volume days.
6.  And many other small previously unidentified bugs.

We are very excited about this newest release and are looking forward to your feedback over the next couple of days.  Susan will probably be your best contact but please feel free to contact me at anytime.

Thanks,  David Poston

Thanks for the help with this.

Actually Amy, I will not be able to attend on the 5th.
Is there an alternate date?

Grace is trying to finalize numbers for the above meeting on Thursday, July 5.  Can you please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to attend?

Thanks!
Amy

Easy there...
Everything will be okay...

I will be unable to attend. I'm forecasting a bad mood hitting at about 4:15 on July 9.

There will be a Real-Time Group Meeting on July 9th at 4:30.  We will be discussing new Ferc Rules, Dispute Management, Group Changes and Cuts.
Please let me know immediately if you will be unable to attend.

Nikki,

Thanks for the note and I hope your doing well.  You're right, sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off.

I was able to close on my condo last weekend.  It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around, but I finally got moved in on Friday night.  I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far.  The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel.  My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown, so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work. 

Like you, I am not sure what Brendan might have told you about me...so here goes.  I was born on the east coast (Connecticut), moved around for a while, and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents.  I went to highschool in Kelso (this is where I met and then graduated with Brendan).  Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle.  College was good, if a bit long.  I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis (whoa!).  A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with Enron as a trader, trading hourly electricity in the West.  I started out on shift, but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule (usually 10-12 hours a day) during the week.  I enjoy the job a ton, the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop.

With regards to your visit.  I've been in Portland for a few years now, so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town.  Depending on when you get here and how things go,  we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast.  Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there (especially if you're from New Mexico).  If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt. St. Helens and the gorge...good swimming, hiking etc.  It should be a blast. 

Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town?  I am pretty open at the start of July, and although it always rains on the 4th (EVERY single year), that's still a good time to be coming up.  Besides, if you ever thought about moving here, you have to understand why its so green...

It was good to hear from you, and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.

Take care.

Bill

These schedule changes must be called in.  Just a reminder.
Bill

Kate, take a quick look at this would you?

Group,

Please add Ainsley Gaddis and remove Daniel Kang from your list when sending the spreadsheets to EES.

Bill,

My name is Ainsley and I am taking over for Daniel Kang.  I was checking to see if there were any real time deals for 06-12 and 06-14.  Thanks!

Alan,
I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you. Eric Linder and Steve Merriss. Their home numbers are 503-753-8716 and 503-241-3729 respectively. Both had worked for me for about 8-9 months. These are the only numbers I have for them as their cell phones have been canceled.

Cannot wait...

Dear Traders,

We will have our regular bi-weekly Enpower meeting this Wednesday at 1 PM in the CASCADE conference room (unless otherwise notified of a conference room or time change).  Please make plans to be in attendance.

Agenda items:

Update on DPR impact for each trading group

Discussion on establishing dollar threshold levels for each group

Discussion on new ideas for timely dispute resolution 

The meeting should last 15 - 20 minutes. If you will not be there, please let me know in advance who will be in attendance for your group.

Thanks and see you there!
 
Virginia and Mike

Thanks Lisa...

I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts.  For the past 6 month, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower.  Accordingly, by the end of the day when I have to route, it has made my job that much easier.  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly.  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone's lives better!

Keep up the great work guys!!!!

Lisa

Steve,
My address is Bill Williams III,
Please make the correction.
Thanks,
Bill

Bill - Please let this guy know he is sending to the wrong Bill Williams

Anna,
When you have a chance, I would like to pay you for the golf tournament and grab a receipt from you while I am at it.  My impression is that the deadline is approaching and that this is something we need to get done today.
Please let me know when you might be available or just grab me when you have a chance.

Thanks,

Bill

Just wanted to congratulate you guys on the excellent work on the night of the 13th.  The SAR was within $4 of risk managment's numbers on the Daily Position Report!  The night note looked very good (great job on the services portion) and there were ZERO problems with the shift.
The hard work is much appreciated, keep it up.

Bill

Group,

We are long 25 mws 7-22 on Monday in SP-15 at $65.  Deals should be under ST-WBOM.

We are also long 25 mws under the ST-CALI book.  Please be sure to put this in the service sheet.  Other ST-CALI length or EES shorts will be on Phil Platters sheet and in CAPS.

Thanks,

Bill

Chris,

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Rhonda,
The CP "New" represents a counterparty as yet to be determined.  I am working with Diana Scholtes on this.  This deal is essentially a placeholder.
I will give you the information as I receive it.

Thanks,
Bill

Please tell me who this CP is?

Sure,
The other members in the real-time group are:
Ryan Slinger
Geir Solberg

Thanks,

No problem, is it possible for you to give me a list of names as I am not sure who does what just yet.

Thanks,

Theresa,
Could you add DL-Portland Shift to this distribution. I would like the guys in Real-Time to be able to see this information when they come in.
Thanks,

Thank you for the confirmation. That is very good news.

Bill -

I have confirmed that employees who were let go last week are entitled to receive the additional payment of $4,500.  Just a reminder.....this payment will have taxes and other deductions taken.

Amy

Thanks for the information Heather.  This looks good and useful.
Would you have any information on what tools we used to settle?  Or was it all a manual process?

B  

Bill and Chris - this is what I remember as to settlements with the DEC bidding strategy.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

-Heather

Delano will schedule into the Day Ahead market and make a sale at the PX index price.  Real Time submits dec bids in the Suplemental Energy Market for any hours when they believe there is a good chance of being dec'd at a 0 price (the pprice you bid may be different than 0 to establish ouselves in the ISO Merit order - ).  Real Time makes 50% of the difference between the day ahead PX and the dec price (in this case 0).

Brooklyn,
Unfortunately the change to $290 was not the final price for deal #620476 on 05/23.  It should be $295 for HE 15-17 and $290 for HE 18-19.  I have checked Enpower and the sheet to make sure that they reflect these changes.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Bill
 

Group,

We have 25 mws of length in the BOM book at $56 again for 06/14/01 on peak.  This energy is in NP-15.  Please make deals under ST-WBOM.

ST-CALI has another 5 mws each hour on peak in NP-15.  See CAPS for other information.

Thanks,
Bill

Thank you Jill

Based on that, I have tentatively booked a room 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at

Bill,

  Do you know who in Houston  keeps up the Lotus Notes Database?  There is a 2 week gap in the database between current and archived records.  
  Just wondering if you know..

  Virginia

Group,

We are long for the 13th in California, 25 mws under ST-WBOM in NP-15 at $57.  

We are also long 22 mws under ST-CALI in NP-15.  ST-CALI is also short in the morning in SP-15.  They are short at around $30.  ST-CALI is providing us with a sheet detailing their positions for RT, we will now be providing them with a sheet each morning detailing their sales from the previous day.  Going forward, please put all the ST-CALI sales or length in the service sheet beneath our activity.

We are also short 10 mws to EWEB for HE 1-12, Willamette has a month long sale at $270 but needs to come down unexpectedly for maintenance.  We will backfill this and split any profit with Services.

Finally...

We must check out with BPA each hour for Frontier and GCPUD.  Please make the call right after you call EPE dispatchers (between 25 after and 35 after).  The new service sheets have a place for initials for the call each hour, please initial after making the call to BPA (ext. 2277).

ALSO...TIMBERS TOMORROW NIGHT!

Steve,
Just want to make sure you have me as Bill Williams III.
Thanks, 
BIll

This must be for you Bill.
Perhaps you can contact Mr. Merris.

Jon 

I'm sorry I missed your call. I know you are busy but please let me know when you have something. Leaf called yesterday looking for clarification and I would like to be able to give him an answer.
Thanks,
Bill

I don't have an update yet, but will chase first thing in the morning.

Sorry!
Amy

Jim,
Just a quick note regarding scheduling on Saturday.  There should be a 25 mw n-firm export for HE 7-10 and HE 13-22.  The schedule ID for HE 7-10 was CISO_EPMI_BUNNY.  The schedule ID for HE13-22 was EPMI_CISO_BUNNY.  For HE 11 and HE12, Danielle at the CISO misentered our schedule.  CAPS shows a final of 25 mws as a firm import.  This should be a n-firm export.  We recieved the energy as a firm export from the CISO.  All schedules should be under ECTSTSW not ECTRT.  If you have questions please let me know.

Thanks,

Bill

Let me know if you have any questions.
  

We are long 25 mws in NP-15 at $54 for HE 7-22.  This is under the ST-WBOM line in CAPS.  We are long at $54.00
Call me with any questions...
Thanks,
Bill

Thank you Kysa,
I appreciate the info.
B

Hi Bill

Your deal number is 642575, 25 MW, on peak for $53.46.

Kysa M. Alport

Jim,
Harbor and Martel were declined with the CISO for 06/08/01 HE 1 and HE 2.  The reasons: for Harbor the CISO inc'd them to 10, and ignored their operating limits as entered at 60 and 80.  Martel was inc'd but could not ramp up.  Both bids were properly entered by were ignored by the CISO.  Delano was incd'd and dec'd several times in the morning and was able to respond.
Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Could you send me and Donna Shediun an e-mail, documenting the Decline to Harbor and Martel (Wheel Abrator)  
for supplimental 6/8/01, HE 1, interval 1 and 2.

Jim

Greg,

Sorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments.  I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May.  I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form.
My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise.

1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table.
2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions.
3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in Enron.
4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk.
5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities.
6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals.

I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months.

If you have any questions just let me know.
Thanks, 
Bill

Phil Platter

Sean Crandall

I assume you will be reviewing me as well.
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill/Les:

Please provide me with 10 names of potential reviewers for your mid-year review - this list will be reduced to 5-7, however, we need to manage overload on any particular reviewer. I need these by COB Tuesday.

You are correct, 
The EOL trades were not properly acccounted for. 
We need FSP 2000, not FSP 2002...
I think we have it sorted out now though.

But yeah, too much stress is never healthy...I don't know exactly what the deal is.

Bill

I understand the issues with the new volume.
It is understandable we are going to have issues rolling something out like that.
I have just been concerned lately with Kate's stressed out state.

So what do you think happened last night.
How did the EOL trades mess us up?
Just curious as to how it is flowing.
Did the EOL trades not get captured in CAPS?

Things have definitely been difficult over here. In truth, I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes. We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow.
So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else. She probably just shows it a bit more.
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.

My apologies for the delay.
Bill

Is Kate very stressed out lately?
I have just noticed that she is constantly angry - how are things going over there?

Good morning,
We have had some changes in our real-time group at Enron and consequently I would like to request a password change for the following EPMI logins. Please notify me when these changes will be effective.

1.)	real_time_epmiwe-- the current password is epmishift, I would like to change it to: huskies

2.)	real_time_epmiwe2-- the current password is realtimers2, I would like to change it to: ducks

3.)	real_time_epmiwe3-- the current password is oregon, I would like to change it to: beavers

4.)	settlements-- the current password is settlements, I would like to change it to: cougars

Thank you for your help with this.

I also need a performance feedback form.
You can reach me at 503-464-3730

Thanks,

Tracy - I have no summer intern.  Bill Williams III might.  I'll forward to him.

Summer is quickly drawing to a close for our summer interns.  

We have scheduled several departure dates for the interns.  Our records indicate that your summer intern, Todd Bland, is scheduled to return to school on 8/17/01.  

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 7th at 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

Sincerely,

Traci Warner

John,

How was Austin?  Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for?  How about golf?  Everyone has only ever had good things to say about Austin.

Audi TT?
NICE pick.  Is that a 6-speed?  Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right (matches the 400E).  Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.  I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?

So I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.  Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...

John,
Thanks for the timely note.  PRC is today.
Much appreciated.

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

JMF

Sean,

Just to follow-up from yesterday. Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power "consulting" agreement). Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two. As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.

Ideas?

Bill

Group,
We will be meeting on Thursday at 4:30 to discuss recent changes and the company outlook with Tim on Thursday Dec. 13th at 4:30. Please call me if you cannot make it.
Thanks,

Bill

Thank you.

Bam. Let me know what you hear

Sorry to hear it man. It has not been a great last couple of months.

Lanegan died in his sleep last night.

What up dawg! How are you and Meg doing?
I still have a job. It has been an extremely rocky time. However, I feel optimistic that our trading business will continue in some fashion. I believe that we will be bought out by an investment bank and that we will be able to start trading again. The chances are good that I will have to thin out my group a bit, I am hoping that attrition will take care of some of the members of the group. I think we are going to let traders out of their contract if they want to leave. Hopefully that will cut down on any direct lay-offs I will have to do. It would suck having to lay-off good people. Its worrisome but like I said, I am optimistic. Soccer was going well, but I sprained my knee pretty badly playing indoor last night, so another two-three weeks before I am out there playing again...bollocks! Its ridiculous. How are things with you? I have two tickets to Mark Lanegan on December 19th at Berbatis Pan.  Are you going to be in town at that point? Its gonna be sweet. 
Still enjoying the Audi. My address is 1005 SW Park Ave. #706, Portland OR, 97205. Give me a ring and let me know what the word is. 503-887-3449.

Later,

So, do you still have a job? What is your address?

Group-

As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" (this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).

IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.

Thanks,

Bill

For all cuts the following procedures apply...

1.) Notes as usual

2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).

3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just "bow out" gracefully if you have no other options with the words "L - D's."

4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.

Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.

This will probably not be a fun weekend. 
I appreciate your help. 

Bill

This is important---

Please be advised that:

A counterparty that wants to terminate a contract needs to send a letter of termination via fax to (713) 646-3227
	           The termination letter needs to include:
		1.) List of contracts being terminated
		2.) Calculation of termination payment
		3.) Expectation of payments if applicable
  
A counterparty that unwinds deals does not mean a contract its null and void; the counterparty is still liable for the existing deals governed by the contract

Please forward this on to anyone who needs this information.

Thanks,

Susan

Group,

As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended. For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.

Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission. Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws. But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest. These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.

Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,

Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. 

We will be handling cuts in the following manner:

1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.

2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.

3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).

4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.

5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk.

I appreciate your help and diligence.
Thanks,

Bill

Susan,
Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded.

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.

I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26. We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD. Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws. I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064. I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Bill

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Tag number 38616 was cut for he 06 on sunday.  The schedule was 25mw to the ciso @ mead sinking with MWD.  Calpine couldn't supply the energy so the schedule was cut to zero.  I made every attempt to resupply the power from NEVP, which was willing to sell me the power for $16.00, but Dawn @ the CISO would not let me resupply the schedule.  I thought this to be sort of wierd considering even WAPA was on board.  Please see me with any question.

Group-

We are currently owed money by CERS (approximately $100,000). We need to net this to a zero by Friday. It is very important that each of you call CERS and purchase energy from them to net this position out. Otherwise--we will see a loss of $100,000. Let's make this problem go away.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

The estimated time of the call from EPE that we were not checking out with SRP is about 11:30pm pst.  I immediately called SRP back at that point.

Darin

Bill,

For He 24 EPE was prescheduled to send 50mw to the ISO.  The schedule was cut earlier in the day.  There was no note on the model or in Lotus notes.  When the issue was brought to my attention by EPE gen. I looked in the service book and found a note about it.  I called SRP at 9:30 pst to verify that they were receiving the power.  Jose at SRP said he was receiving nothing from EPE for he 24.  The schedule was ultimately taken out.  SRP later called El Paso and said they were not checking out.  I discussed the issue with Jose and he did not agree that our conversation took place as it did.  I tried to get him to take out the schedule and he would not, so I suggested that we pull the tapes.  However, there is a tag for the schedule-  Tag#1125D.  In retrospect I should have given the tag# to Jose.

Darin

Thanks for reserving the room.
I will not need any food ordered.

Tim,

I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West. I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex. I am considering participating with Dow Jones. I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time. It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks. I am working with Kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index. I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to Steve Hall when they arrive. I have concerns that participating in this index may spread some of the value we obtain in making a market on EOL to our counterparties. I would appreciate your thoughts on this when you have an opportunity.

Enpower Preschedule Workspace and Path Confirmation

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under "Tools."
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose "West" and click "Okay."
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the "Control" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called "Cut Information" will come up. Select the "New Path Cut" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)

Group,

We will have an emergency meeting on Monday, November 26th at 4 PM. We will be going live on EOL for HE 7-22 on Monday. We will be discussing EOL trading, the new confirmation workspace in Enpower, business practice changes, and the Dynegy merger. Please make plans to attend. Contact me as soon as you can if you think you may not be able to make it.

Thanks,
Bill

Group,
We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.

So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.

1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)

2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.

3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.

4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:
Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.

Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.

5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. 

	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. 

	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.

6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.

Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill

Jim,
You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet. This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section. My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning. You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet. If you have any questions just let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3. We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5. This cost us $7.50. We imported it from MEAD 230.
We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. This is from Redding.

Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead. You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased. If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased. We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.

Thanks,

Dipak,
Seattle/Tacoma is the summation of a large number of meters.
The largest residential loads are broken out separately as tabs.
The temps are from the research/weather folder.
Initially, I am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation.
We can refine things a bit later.
Jason

 

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount
of load in the area, and I was just curious if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of.
I appreciate whatever help you can provide.
Thanks,

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

Patti, Stacey,

The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
Zone: Las Vegas
Facility: UNA - Las Vegas

It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
Harry Allen (2-4015)
Apex (2-4002)
Blue Diamond (2-4016)
Pecos (2-4013)
Lone Mountain (2-4012)

Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.

The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.

Let me know what you think.

Well, go find Glen Cook's The Black Company to start a less deep, but still entertaining, series.

I forgot to tell you how mad I was as I got into the book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ripped off from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 80% of Jordan's work was published up to 4 years before Goodkind. 80% of his ideas are ripped off by Goodkind. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell Ice Cream, wanting another but having no more Bluebell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak...

Keith,
I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
respective meters on NWPL:

Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302

Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
nominate through the Cascade LDC?
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.

Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
above plants closed or reduced capacity.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

That is awesome. You must have been jizzing non-stop since the All-Star break.

Hey. Did you know that Woody Williams was a shortstop for the Cougars back
in the 80's? How cool is that? Not only is he a bad ass that beats the Big
Unit in the playoffs, but he's one of us.

You didn't answer if you would clean more or less boats this year than the last guy.

And yes, I am with Beth.

And yes, I am still a stud-cowboy.

I don't clean boats damnit. I manufacture them from powder form
polyethelene. I bake them in big rotating ovens. It's pretty damn cool. Tara
is 95% sure she is returning. Notice how I answer all of the questions you
asked.

So Tara is definitely returning?

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job?
Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
your position in the history of Triumph Boats?

BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.

   By Dec. 1 or Dec. 31, I forget. Her start date is Aug. 5th. I could give

   Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of
   the
   hull.

I'm always hanging out...

of my pants!

That said, perhaps I can get more casual...
It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but
your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need 
some quality time.

Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me
a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat.

hey are you there darlin?

wanna hang out sometime?

So Tara is definitely returning?

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job? 
Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
your position in the history of Triumph Boats?

BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.

By Dec. 1 or Dec. 31, I forget. Her start date is Aug. 5th. I could give you
a raw water washdown, but I'd have to charge you $185.

So when does Tara have to commit to Big E?

Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of the
hull.

   No dillweed. Just building them. Tara got her offer from Enron. It's
   pretty
   nice. Are you still working 547 hours per week?

   Are you cleaning fishing boats, too?

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
   quest
      for a
      Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment,
   I
      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
      together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and
   get
      as
      accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending.
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.

But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted). 
Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to:

Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am excited
about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in the first
set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get any non-duplicates
that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these sets?

Thanks for the product.
Jason  

I just got back from checking out the new building. It's sweet.
J

Jason,
I hope this is your e-mail address & that you get this message.  We hadn't heard from you in FOREVER, so I thought I'd see what you are up to.  I also have some Enron questions for you.  So, if you are still breathing, reply ASAP & I'll send you a long, juicy e-mail for your reading pleasure. =)

The Index settles during bid week for the following month (last week of Sep for Oct) and is
published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the
difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct 
basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for 
The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual
"index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index.
I know it is confusing.
Jason

I'm confused. The gas daily prices is ok.
Question on index curves. What index curves do you need?

	a. the curves from egs_curves that are inserted into the
	   database everyday because the prices are different everyday.
	   risk type code = 'I' and curve_type_cd = 'PR'.

	b. the curves from the pub posting that are inserted into
	    the database once a month. These are the settle price curves.
	    risk type code = 'D' and curve_type_cd = 'SP'

That's fine. The Index curves we are most concerned with (the current month), will be set in the next day
or so and will not change for the duration of the month. Next month's index curves can be loaded whenever.

Jason

I am still waiting for your reply.

Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.

A few relevant points:

2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but you
WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed.
3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacement strategy/shooter
game playable by 4+ people.

 On a more relevant note, Jason, drop that hamster.

Jason,
Randy Friedman informed me that the information you need is in our Financial
Facts Quarterly.  Please send me your mailing address and I will send you
the two print issues of our Financial Facts Quarterly that preceded the ones
on our website.

Jim Boehlke
Director of Investor Relations
Telephone:  (503) 721-2451
Facsimile:  (503) 721-2516 <<...>>
Email:  jrb@nwnatural.com

I am interested in obtaining a load breakdown by industrial, residential, and electrical
generator customers for your utility, on a monthly basis, as part of a NWPL market
research project. If you could give me some contact information, I would appreciate
the help.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst

Mr. Boehlke:

After speaking to a NW Natural representative, I was told to contact you for more
specifics regarding information on your customer breakdown. 
I am interested in gas load by residential, industrial, and electrical generation on a weekly
or monthly basis. Your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly
similar format, but I was hoping I could get more specific numbers, including the type
of industrial user (high-tech, aluminum, agricultural, etc.) and historicals back to last
winter. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it, as trying to forecast NWPL
load without some general NW Natural data is impossible.

Thanks,

Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst

I am interested in Cascade's natural gas demand by broad customer class - such as residential, industrial, and electric
generation - over the past year. Also, if possible, a list of the larger generators or industrials that you serve. 

Could you direct me to the department or individual who could best assist me in this research?

Thanks,

If you decide not to forward this,  please send it back 
to Darleene Barrientos [darleeneah@earthlink.net ]. This is  an actual 
petition, and "signatures" 
will be lost if you drop the  line. 
  
  
Please take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your 
part. And be sure to include other members of your  
household who are willing to sign. 
Petition to the United Nations  Background Information: 
Madhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war 
upon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996, 
women have had to wear burqua and have been 
beaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper 
attire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh 
covering in front of their eyes. One woman 
was beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists 
for accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was 
driving. Another was stoned to death for 
trying  to leave the country with a man that was not a 
relative. 
Women are not allowed to work  or even go out in public 
without a male relative; professional women such  as 
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and 
writers have  been forced from their jobs and 
restricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is 
present must have their windows painted so that she 
can never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent 
shoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear 
of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because 
they cannot work, those without male 
relatives or husbands are  either starving to death or 
begging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s. 
Depression is becoming so widespread that it has 
reached  emergency 
levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic 
society  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but 
relief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate 
among women must be 
extraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper 
medication and treatment for severe depression and  
would rather take their lives than live in such 
conditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a 
reporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies 
lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their 
burqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but 
slowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were 
seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or  
crying, most of them in fear. 
It is at the point where the  term "human rights 
violations" has become an understatement. Husbands  
have the power of life and death over their women 
relatives,  especially their wives, but an angry 
mob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman, 
often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  
offending them in the slightest way. Women 
enjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally 
as they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public 
alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this 
transition is the  main reason for the depression and 
suicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or 
simply used to basic human freedoms are now 
severely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the 
name of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not 
their tradition or 'culture', but it is  
alien to them, and it is extreme even for those 
cultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone 
has a right to a tolerable human  
existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. 
If we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name 
of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,  
citizens of the world can certainly express 
peaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and 
injustice committed against women by the Taliban.  
STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current 
treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely  
UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the 
United Nations and that the  current situation overseas 
will not be tolerated. 
Women's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it 
is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as  
subhuman and as so much property. Equality 
and human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a 
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan 
or elsewhere.

IT DOES PRODUCE SOME

 
Enron
Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies. The company, which owns approximately $37 billion in energy and  communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, delivers physical  commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the  world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online  business - EnronOnline. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com << File: http://www.enron.com/ >> . The stock is traded under the  ticker symbol "ENE".
 
 
Is this correct? I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....
 
Beth

I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your criticisms.
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin.
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a pact
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul.
Love,
Jason

P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me,
and vice versa.

I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get mad, I could put
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full.
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.
J

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we go.
And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for granted.

I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little bit of security. 
I need something. 
I need to stop fighting with you and do something with my life.

OK. 
We can try it. There should be four jars:

The game was nail-bitingly close, but Chinese 12 year old hookah's strategy of
ChoKoNu mayhem was the deciding factor.
At one point, Beth and I soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
(and rear-action monk cowards), but it was Alan's resource control that won out.
But for the most part, I would characterize the game as a draw.
Bring on the firstperson shooters until Star Wars.

Chris,
Could these numbers be loaded into the db for October? These are cyc 13
pulled from Citrix, up to the 30th, incl points not grabbed by the HTML scraper.
Thanks,
Jason
 

So Camas Jr is confirmed paper mill?
Do you know what is behind the Bellingham II point (290)?
Bellingham/Ferndale (472) I understand is the Ferndale power plant; is this 290 point
another unit?
Thanks,
Jason

That's where the James River Paper Mill is I think... I'll check it out

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

A good beating reminds me of my uncle Sam's place.
 A good beating reminds us all of John's place... 

I look forward to an evening of intense concentration puncuated by controlling, berating direction. 
And that's just Beth's backseat driving on the way to Greenway. 
Hey-oh!
But seriously, folks, I'm probably not in for any game night where Travis is encouraging guys to feel his lance.
Isn't there enough posturing?
J

This is almost scary... 
but not as SCARY AS....as....well, crap. 
Sameer 

If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from Devil-Pooch made me
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle.
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought):
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,
	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.
	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the point
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated 
and huge.
3) Build castles on conquered territory.

If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,
it's over.

J

If any of you are available for some strategy practices tonight...choose what civ's we'll play and practice leveraging their strengths against an enemy.  We have failed to play like a team in every battle yet, we must improve our solidarity as a fighting force.  I think that means setting team members' priorities for army segments.
Ex: Beth goes Byzantine and provides us with some walls and infantry, I gor Briton and provide archers and siege weapons, Jay goes nuts with knights and monks. We attack one base eliminating hostile towers and units, and then allow the siege weapons to level the buildings with archer and monk support.  Knights at perimeter to protect army while we finish the job and beth building some protective walls to add to the trouble the enemy must go throught o attack us while we FINISH OFF every base.
I also suspect that twot hings have really added to allan's victories. 
1) Walls everywhere.  We have to knock the m down to get to him and he'll always know about it. 
2) Guard shacks every where.  He always sees where we are.  We never know where he is. 
So, who can play with me tonight?  My place?  Your place?  Office? 

I know. Houston sucks.
XO

A director was mean to me today and made me cry. That was what that last email was about. Another director was talking to me about it. That was why I was not available for your call. Please do not call and ask me about it. I do not want to talk about it around Fred and Ashley. 

Sorry this took so long. I talked to Geof and got the OK.
Thanks,

Jason, did you get a chance to talk to Geof Storey about using the Flexible Deal Viewer? If you want us to install it and let you give it a try give Ahmad a call at 5-4770 and we can come up and install it on your PC.

Thanks. My battery cap looked a little different. I will try to take it off tonight and will take a picture.
It wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked (it wasn't nearly as clean around the
battery as grandmas). Hopefully no more problems.

Jason

Jay,
Here's 3 pictures as I see Grandma's car.
One with the hot battery terminal cap on.
One with the hot battery terminal cap off.
One showing where the hot cable from your battery connects to your starter.
Hope they help.
Love Dad
PS: Let me know if you get these.  I made the files as small as possible,
but don't know if they are too big to get to you.

 

1) It's Grease.
2) It's 'NSYNC, and I am insulted by your inaccurate spelling of this legendary band's name

  

Like the Las Vegas product, we need to re-map the curve in sitara to PGE-Topock instead of Socal,
but we can go ahead and roll out the next day product.

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

Do you still have a job? Tara is hearing some pretty nasty stuff about
Enron. She's pretty worried that they are gonna renig on their offer.

Karen,
I worked in ENA West Risk from July 2000 until March 1, 2001, when I began West Logistics. Risk was counted as my first
rotation. Scheduling is my second.
Jason

All,

Thank you all for supplying details on your Trading Track rotation earlier.  I would however like for you to provide me with details of your previous rotations within the A&A program at Enron in the following format:

1.	Rotation (i.e. S/E Fundamentals)
2.	Business Unit (ENA/EGM etc)
3.	Duration (Month/year)
4.	Supervisor

I would be greatful if you could provide this as soon as possible.

Kind regards,

Karen.

According to CNBC, the Dynegy deal is close, with an announcement today.
I'm not really nervous; Enron's strength is its wholesale trading dept. 
I'm not sure about non-core business and corporate hacks, though.
We'll see how it all shakes out - it's really hard to believe it has come to this.

So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we
are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

   Do you still have a job? Tara is hearing some pretty nasty stuff about
   Enron. She's pretty worried that they are gonna renig on their offer.

I'm eating Droubi's middle eastern cuisine right now, thinking of the times

We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,
as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martin
is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun
Alexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or at
least split carries. 
The next 2 games will be tough.
Jason

This Pump and go deep clown is so lucky we didn't blow him out.  We need more linebackers less DEs.  He got lucky / we need a better defense.  Great call on the Staley tip.

I am corrected--thanks.  What do you think about Illinova??  Close to home,

to get into the energy marketing business.  They might like an ex-enron guy.

I open my email, and Trav is inviting people over, threatening to pull out
the ol' lance, and comparing dimensions with Matty. I guess that means
it's game night.
Is Allan going to around Tues? He has been notoriously absent, and may 
not be allowed to play anymore.

Girth is more important than length, anyway. 

oh, and the pause for "Friends" was a nice touch. I think that reveals the true, inner warlike
nature of MillerKnight. You go, girlfriend!

Girth is more important than length, anyway. 

Thurs I can play after Thirtysomething...

but on a serious note, I need some clarification on when AoE lance night is taking place,
and when XBox night (Thurs?) is happening. I'll bring some Miller for MK
Jason

Just for Good Measure... 
Nobody is comparing dimensions with me...unless you wanna dredge up a new reason to hate your parents. 
So, have we got a full room for tomorrow? 
I'll work out the details with Trav and get back to you guys about HALO on Thursday--we might want to use two locations and play online if we can be sure of our ability to do that.  Otherwise, we'll all meet in one place to oooh and aaaah over HALO and booze.

Hey, thanks for trying to squeeze in a few minutes with your friends the weekend you finally
fly down to Houston. I wouldn't expect you to make a trip unless you had to.

How are things at Dynegy? Are you guys just going business as usual for now?
No use getting to worked up, it'll be a long time before things actually
happen. Man, who woulda thunk it? If you lose your job, you wanna open a bar
with me and Clay?

I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs
for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston.
It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,
swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into
it, and travel a long way to go.
Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy look
at it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.

Love,
Jason

Hi Jason,
We don't hear much from you these days.
 Did you watch the Cowboys game yesterday? I didn't know that Wright was
out.
 We bought a digital camera Fri. so we're going to Jill's when she gets off
work to take some pictures of Mikayl. I'll also make sure we take some
pictures of him in his Halloween costume. I took a day off today. the
weather has been really nice. I took some good pictures of Dad on his
motorcycle.
 Better go and get ready to go to Jill's.
 Love, Mom

Dearest Trav, 
Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV for me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests.

responsible for sending you the monthly updates in the future. Also, I am 
planning a trip to the Middle East at the end of March and the beginning of

Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference 
between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity 
Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs 
$4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 
NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto 
Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. 
There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco 
if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. 
Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we 
can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the 
Early Spring Cargo.

Paul

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the 
economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those 
mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured 
between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price 
difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and 
what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us 
out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add 
an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and 
Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another 
$4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced 
from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be 
November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date 
of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to 
receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh 
Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on 
Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days 
after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two 
Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the 
dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days 
after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's 
risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily 
influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy 
back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon 
cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract 
price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the 
economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the 
NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the 
last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need 
to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for 
the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the 
contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are 
trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we 
have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the 
payment terms?  How are you with cash?

Miguel Maltes@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in 
ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) 
at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will 
be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day 
after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco  1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas     210,000 gallons
* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl,ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 
5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 
gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per 
month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

Next cargo arrival delivery window July 20 - 31, 2001.

Saludos

Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's 
assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 
gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 
131,850 Btu/gallon)

Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 
100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG 
inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage 
for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply 
enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the 
number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is 
automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG 
than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 
outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 
1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it 
is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco 
is not assumed to be in an outage.

Walt,

EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  

I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas. 

Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?

Thanks,

Paul 

Perry,

Walt is saying the field would just tap the line and install a block valve. Can you talk to Sammie Williams and make sure that you both agree regarding the EFM.

Thanks,

Paul

Paul we the 12" Lips/Mocane TW line in this section and it averages 600# of pressure.  This is the only line we have in this area.  We would install the side valve and the rest we would let EOG furnish [EFM other equipment etc..]  If you need more information let us know.
Rick Brown can give you a cost estimate 806-342-2044 and Sammy Williams can inform you on the EFM question 806-669-3391  Ext 10.

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

Many Thanks,

Steve,

Per my note, the attached is electronic form of data requested.

Paul

 

Paul,

I reviewed the data in the CBS system as well as the contract folders in order to respond to your questions.  Here are my findings:
Information regarding delivery point volumes provided by TK are correct.  
The requests for realignment on both contracts were effective 4/1/01 through the remaining term of the contracts.
There is a copy of the executed amendments in the respective contract folders and/or in Envision (K 25841 - amendment #66, K 26511 - amendment #34)
K 25841 has no language prohibiting PG&E ET-GC to realign during the term of the agreement
K 26511 does have language in a discount letter agreement dated 5/27/99 stating "Shipper shall have a one time option during the term of the discount agreement while retaining the discounted rate to change primary delivery point capacity to PG&E Topock, subject to the availability of capacity at such point."

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'll give you a call with this information as well.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

25841		40,000/d to Topock

26511		21,000/d to Needles

TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

25841		29,000/d to Topock
		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

Barbara,
 
I noticed the same thing and asked Laura to investigate. I am out of the office but will return on Monday. We'll straighten it out then.
 
Talk to you soon,
 
Paul

Lorraine and Paul:   Greetings.  Our first invoice under our new firm transportation agreement is incorrect.  I have asked our accounting people to call Laura Giambrone to discuss but wanted to bring this to your attention in case she needs your assistance to understand the terms of our deal.  The invoice includes a "reservation" charge equal to the October MDQ times the number of days in the month times the discount rate, which is correct (35,000 x 31 x $0.08 = $86,800).  However, the invoice also includes a "commodity" charge of $3,945.47.  

I believe it is just a matter of setting it up correctly in the computer because the invoices we received under our old contract also included a "reservation" charge and a "commodity" charge, but the two together equaled the negotiated rate.  I would appreciate any help you could provide to get this set up correctly and our October invoice corrected.  

Thanks, 

Barbara Whittaker 

TK,

FYI

 

Please have a look at this and see if you spot anything that needs to be added. I'd like to add our gas quality specs and equipment specs mentioned in Sect. 3.3. 

Next I want to circulate to engineering and operations for comment.

Alton,

Thanks for the concern. Fortunately, I transferred to one of Enron's pipeline companies in mid-September (just before things started getting really crazy). This is the most stable part of the company and we will survive no matter what ... although we may be owned by someone other than Enron. I was also fortunate to have very little Enron stock exposure. Many of my friends have not been so fortunate. They are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth.

Andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also. I don't understand how they could have allowed Enron to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet.

Are you all going to Port Neches for Thanksgiving? Renee and I are going tonight. I hope that you all have a very nice Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Many Happy Returns,

Paul

Someone was asking me the other day if I had
any friends at Enron....you came to mind!

Are you weathering the storm? Unbelievable
is the word that comes to my mind.

We use Andersen also and I know they are
quite "tight lipped" about the situation!

I sincerely hope everything works out for you
and the other Enron employees that have done
nothing more than "bust your rears" for the good
of the "Big E".

Dennis just changed the flag last week.  It should now be creating a credit for commodity.

Final pricing for the subject cargo is dependent on Nov-Jan LPG prices. A provisional amount is due today. Please base the provisional amount on a Nov MB price of 35-cents, Dec and Jan MB prices of 32.5-cents. These prices reflect the current market.

Thanks,

Paul

Suzanne,

I calculate a total amount due of $1,839,120.46. That is:

	   932,967 gallons @ $0.46396
	1,625,526 gallons @ $0.41700
	1,679,706 gallons @ $0.39200
	   178,500 gallons @ $0.39200

Total	4,416,699 gallons @ $0.416402 average price.

Please confirm.

Thanks,

Paul

Paul,

The invoices for this lifting were issued with provisional pricing on November 1 and I was assured that payment would be made on the due date of today basis those invoicese.  It has been evident for a while now that the prices for foward months would be going down, but this is the first day I'm hearing that ProCaribe wants revised invoices.

It doesn't need to be said that cash forecasting is very important to Enron at this time and based on previous conversations, I had confirmed to the forecasting group that they would receive the funds today.

The revised invoices will be issued tomorrow.  I need confirmation that the payment of the balance due will be made tomorrow, without fail.  Per my calculations, balance due would be $1,406,580.96 taking into account the $1,000,00.00 payment that was made today.

Please confirm.

Best regards,

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

Paul

  

Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs $4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the Early Spring Cargo.

Paul

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

I'm available on Monday. Thanks!

Have a great holiday.

Well, actually I see it as finally finding someone that could appreciate those ideosyncracies and recognizing them as the gems they are. Ha Ha!!

I'm involved in Enron's LNG business. My focus is fuel management for two power projects - EcoElectrica (Puerto Rico) and Dabhol (India). India is nothing but problems as you may have heard. 

Great to hear from you and know you are alive and well.

Stay in Touch,

Great to hear back.  Jenny and I have just returned from a short trip to
Beijing, where we were antique shopping and eating great Chinese food.

Life in Hong Kong is fast paced and revolves around work.  I travel
throughout the region making private equity investments.  Weekends are a
time to catch up on sleep.  Pretty boring stuff.

I was very happy to hear that you have settled down.   Glad to see that you

of course).

Tuesday, May 8th is fine

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

Tushar,

Please see the attached doc. Call me to discuss 5-5855.

Thanks,

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Paul

Please explain how we will manage the price risk on this.  Remeber that we have to give 15 days worth of product with the sale of  Progas.  What are the payment terms?  How are you with cash?

Miguel Maltes@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
05/04/2001 02:12 PM
Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco		1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas 	   210,000 gallons
* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl?ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

Next cargo arrival delivery window July 20 - 31, 2001.

Saludos

Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 131,850 Btu/gallon)

Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.

Regards,

Paul

Wayne,

I'd like to discuss this further with you. Primarily, does this make me "officially" Dan's supervisor? I can see some pluses to that arrangement.

Shubh,

How are you doing through all of the uncertainty associated with DPC these days? Are we still waiting for the lenders to decide whether or not they will continue funding the project? What is the MSEB's current position?

I'll give you a call Wednesday morning (Mumbai time).

Best Regards,

Paul

Rajesh,

Have you been able to get a draft COU agreement from Clay? 

How is your move coming?

Paul

OK with me.

FYI

On Friday I will be leaving at 4:00p.m. due to a graduation ceremony I have to attend.

Please let me know if this is okay.

Thanks
Telvy

Jaime,

Have you tried Gus Luna or Debbie Keller with Edison Mission? Gus was handling the actual transactions. I kept my own calculations of the settlement amounts but Gus should have copies of the settlement invoices from Enron.

Paul

Paul:

I need to get some hard evidence (paperwork) that subtantiates the gain collected by Eco Holdings on the LPG hedging contracts for the year 2000. I do have copies of the contracts, but for audit purposes we need to have probably the worksheet where we signed off with Enron as to the amounts collected. Who can I talk to to get this?

Jimmy,

Shubh Shrivastava suggested that I contact you regarding getting on the distribution list for news articles relating to the DPC project. I work for Wayne Perry in Houston in the LNG group. We will be performing the services under the Fuel Management Agreement. I am, of course, very interested in reading what the Indian press is printing about the current state of the project.

Thanks,

Paul

Kathleen,

Congratulations,

This is truly great news. I am so happy for you. Remember all of the little people when you are hugely famous.

Love,

Paul

 DPC lenders put off preliminary termination notice

The above article has also appeared in: 

THE TIMES OF INDIA
Friday, May 18, 2001 http://www.timesofindia.com/today/18busi20.htm
DPC lenders meet adjourned for today 
MUMBAI : THE INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India has once again prevented Enron-promoted 2,144-mega-watt Dabhol Power Company from issuing a preliminary termination notice. Bowing to pressure from IDBI, off-shore lenders have agreed to extend the deadline to May 25 for the Maharashtra government and Enron to settle the ongoing payment crisis. However, lenders are going to monitor developments on a daily basis. 

Lenders who held a conference call late evening at IDBI Tower in South Mumbai have decided to postpone issuing the termination notice by a week. Many off-shore lenders of the $2.9-billion DPC are still in favour of issuance of a preliminary termination notice to the Maharashtra government. A preliminary termination notice gives six months to the government agencies to deal with the problems facing the project. It is the starting point of the process of terminating the project. 

When lenders met last time in London on April 23-24, lead lender IDBI had successfully persuaded off-shore lenders not to allow Enron to go ahead with the termination notice. Lenders had informally agreed to lend time -- around two weeks -- to the government of India to sort out payment related issues. The Maharashtra government has, in the meantime, set up the Godbole Committee to renegotiate the project. 

In the meeting in London, most lenders had proposed a dialogue between the government and Enron rather than going in for any precipitative action. Without the lenders' approval, Enron could not go ahead with its proposal at its board meeting held on April 25. In the board meeting, the company had authorised two persons -- Wade Cline, managing director of Enron India and Neil McGregor, president and CEO of Dabhol Power Company -- to issue the termination notice, whenever lenders agree. 

The Indian lenders, led by IDBI, have continued to oppose the termination move. Termination of the project is expected to hurt Indian lenders since, unlike foreign lenders, their exposure risks are not covered under the government guarantee. While the phase II of the 2184 mega-watt power project is under construction at Dabhol in Maharashtra, and part of which is getting ready for commercial operation in June, the phase I that produces 740 mw of electricity has run into a major payment tussle with the sole buyer MSEB. 

Indian financial institutions and banks have contributed around 60 per cent of the debt for DPC with a $1.2 billion exposure. The $2.9-billion project was lead-arranged by IDBI, and a substantial chunk of Indian debt came from IDBI, SBI, ICICI and IFCI. Of the $2 billion debt, $1.6 billion have already been invested in the project. More than 80 per cent of the phase II is already over, and Enron was expecting the phase to go operational by the year-end. The project, the largest FDI in India so far, was financed by a consortium of around 40 commercial banks -- including ANZ Grindlays, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and Citibank. Half a dozen governments including the US, Japan, Belgium, Oman and India have participated in the project financing through various state-owned financial institutions and Exim agencies. 

The recent stand-off between the state government-owned power utility and the US power major stemmed from a payment crisis. MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last year and subsequently defaulted payments, claiming that the cost of power produced by DPC is exorbitant. It also slapped a penalty bill of around Rs 401 crore and is going to slap another Rs 740 crore on DPC for failing to produce electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours after the cold start. Enron India had subsequently invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees, and political force majeure and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause.

DPC lenders meet adjourned for today 

MUMBAI: The on-going global lenders meet of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) over allowing the multinational to issue a pre-termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has been adjourned for Friday. 
"Talks with the foreign lenders would continue Friday as Thursday's session has been adjourned," top financial institution sources said here. The Indian lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), on Thursday participated in the discussions with their international counterparts and tried to persuade the latter to restrain DPC from issuing the pre-termination notice to the loss making board, sources said. 
Technically, the permission to serve the termination notice could be given if 4 per cent of the total lenders were in its favour. The lenders have been discussing the issue since Wednesday by way of tele-conferencing across the globe. DPC's foreign lenders include J-Exim, Citibank NA, and ABN Amro among others. (PTI)

India asks Enron to renegotiate Dabhol contract 

HONG KONG : INDIA has told US energy company Enron it should renegotiate its contentious power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha said on Thursday. 

"We have suggested to Enron that they should seriously renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the government of Maharashtra, because there are certain elements in that power purchase agreement which can undergo a change," Sinha said. 

Enron and India have been sparring for six months over payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for power purchased from Dabhol Power Company. A Dabhol spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on Sinha's statement. He reiterated the company's previously stated position that it is ready for a dialogue to resolve all issues, but a renegotiation of the contract is not on offer. 

DPC has already held a meeting with a Maharashtra government committee and is slated to meet them again on May 23. "Since the purpose of the meeting is only to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal," Dabhol said on May 3. 

DPC is building the world's largest natural gas fired power plant on India's western coast. The 740 megawatt first phase of the facility began operating in 1999. The plant's generating capacity will triple to 2,184 mw when phase two is completed next month. MSEB agreed in 1995 to buy all the power produced by the plant, but now says the power is too expensive, and is refusing to take the additional second-phase capacity. Its change of mind has sparked concern over the fate of the project. DPC has already issued a notice of arbitration, and last month its board authorised management to terminate the contract. A vote on Thursday by lenders to the project is expected to endorse the board's decision, a source close to the matter told Reuters. 

Sinha said he had no comment on the vote. He also declined to reveal the Center's opinion of MSEB's refusal to buy the second-phase power. (Reuters)

Deshmukh convenes meet to discuss Dabhol crisis Sanjay Jog  
Mumbai, May 17: Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on Saturday with state officials, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing Dabhol crisis.
Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that the issues relate to renegotiations with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) like the proposed arbitration proceedings, the Centre's reluctance to purchase Dabhol phase-II power, and issuance of preliminary termination notice to the DPC are likely to to come up prominently at the Saturday's meeting. Furthermore, the meeting would also discuss at length the DPC's refusal to pay rebate of Rs 401-crore charged by MSEB for the mis-declaration and default on the availability of power on January 28. MSEB will complete the review of rebate payment by end of this month and serve another rebate of Rs 400 crore to DPC.
MSEB and state energy department are likely to seek chief minister's intervention to take up the issue of despatch of Dabhol power from phase-II by the Centre in view of their inability to bear additional burden. In fact, the state energy department and MSEB were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power Suresh Prabhu that neither National Thermal Power Corporation nor Power Trading Corportion are in a position to purchase or trade Dabhol power to other states. 
Moreover, the energy department and MSEB were of the view that the Centre, which has provided a Counter Guarantee for Dabhol phase-I, cannot remain as a silent observer, but should bail out the state government and MSEB. The chief minister's meeting is also likely to discuss the "cold" response from the union ministries of power, finance and oil and petroleum in reaching at an acceptable solution. Ironically, the Centre, which has decided to adopt a conciliatory route, has yet to prepare a reply to the DPC's notice served on April 4 for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore.
Sources said that the state government would make a fresh appeal to the Centre to implement a common strategy in defending the stand of MSEB, Centre and state governments at the proposed arbitration proceedings.

'Affordable DPC tariff must to woo third-party buyers' 
The Centre should benchmark "an affordable" tariff of Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) liquified natural gas (LNG) based power, so as to enable the Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to buy and distribute power from the US energy major, according to a senior official of Maharashtra government.
"Now that DPC is ready for renegotiations, why does the Centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational's LNG-based power?," the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by Union power minister Suresh Prabhu that the Centre would allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) jointly approach with a concrete proposal. 
The Union government is also a part of the Godbole panel and the former should not undermine its responsibility merely by stating that "we would try and offer all the help", the official said. When asked if DPC and MSEB would be able to find a "willing party" for the US energy major's costly power, the official said, DPC was ready to reduce the tariff and bring it down to an affordable level following which either NTPC or PTC could source it and pass on to the power-starved north Indian states. 
Last evening, Prabhu had said the Centre would give any status, including a mega project one, if MSEB and DPC approach the Centre for the same together. Prabhu had said that his ministry would extend its cooperation to the state government "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. The minister also categorically stated that NTPC could not buy DPC's power, as it was a mere "power selling entity". "There was no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long-term power purchase agreements have been signed by NTPC with the buying states," he said.
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 mw needed for the state from the 740 mw Phase-I and soon to be commissioned Phase-II of 1,444 mw, to other needy states.

BYSTANDER - Dangerous drift on Dabhol
The Central and state governments have failed to manage the Dabhol crisis effectively, writes John Elliott

No-one seems to be terribly concerned that Enron's $3 billion power project at Dabhol, which is India's most high profile foreign investment, looks as if it is heading rapidly into a meltdown. 
Even stories that Enron is shifting executives' families out of the country - surely the actions of an organisation that is clearing the decks for a showdown - attract relatively little attention. International lenders have suspended loans, and contractors on the Dabhol site are said to be withdrawing. This is no longer - as Suresh Prabhu, the power minister, has put it - merely the sort of "dispute between a generator and a distributor" that has happened in many other countries. 
Sure it started out as that; but it now looks as though Enron plans to take its recent force majeure notice to its logical conclusion and withdraw from India as soon as it can. One does not need a lawyer to realise that Maharashtra has unwittingly been helping Enron assemble evidence of force majeure ever since demands for renegotiation or cancellation of the project came from the state assembly's during its noisy sojourn in Nagpur last November. 
After that, the Maharashtra government stoked the flames by calling for cancellation and by demanding on three separate occasions that the plant should move from being idle to full production in three hours. That is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the Dabhol equipment is not designed to meet. Then the Central government used this time-limit issue as an excuse for not paying Enron money that was due under the project's finance ministry counter guarantee. 
This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive. 
Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve. 
For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start. 
The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra. 
Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial and management capabilities and reach. 
But time is running out and it does not look as if Enron will wait much longer. If it does terminate the contract - and maybe puts the Dabhol company into bankruptcy - India's image will suffer because of the government's failure to pay the counter guarantees, which could well be presented as the central issue. The only beneficiary of this disaster would be the company that eventually picks up the pieces at Dabhol because it will obtain the project at a knockdown price. 
This may sound as if I am arguing that Enron is in the right. I am not. What I am arguing however is that the Central and state governments have failed to manage this crisis effectively. Instead they are treating it with a characteristic sense of drift - assuming no doubt that, like so many crises in this country, it will solve itself - which it will not. 
If anyone doubts Enron's motive for ridding itself of its India business, just look at its recent first quarter results: profits up 20 per cent to $406 million on sales that had almost quadrupled to $50 billion. Does anyone seriously think that Dabhol matters to such an international commodities trader?

Godbole panel not to seek replacements Our Regional Bureau in Mumbai
Chairman of the renegotiation committee appointed to hold discussions with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) Madhav Godbole, on Wednesday said the remaining six members on the committee were adequate to fruitfully continue negotiations with the power major. 
Responding to a query whether the withdrawal by three appointees on the committee -- EAS Sarma, RK Pachouri and Kirit Parikh -- would hamper negotiations with DPC considering their respective expertise in fields of finance and power, Godbole told Business Standard, "I would not like to get into such an argument. As far as the committee is concerned we would not be seeking fresh inductions." He was reacting to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's statement made earlier on Wednesday, wherein he said the government would wait for the chairman of the renegotiation committee to make a requisition for new members on the committee.
Deshmukh also told mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, "We have repeatedly informed the centre of our inability to absorb the DPC power that would become available following the completion of phase II of the project." He also observed that while Maharashtra was keen to ensure the active participation of individual members from the Union finance, energy and legal ministries for a fruitful dialogue process with DPC, the appointment of retired bureaucrat AV Gokak was not clear on some issues.
"Whether Gokak is authorised by the centre with some powers to negotiate on its behalf is not clear as of now. However, with renegotiations currently on, we would like to await the committee's deliberations," he said. The next meeting of the renegotiating committee with DPC is scheduled for May 23.

One does not need a lawyer to realise that Maharashtra has unwittingly been helping Enron assemble evidence of force majeure ever since demands for renegotiation or cancellation of the project came from the state assembly's during its noisy sojourn in Nagpur last November. 
After that, the Maharashtra government stoked the flames by calling for cancellation and by demanding on three separate occasions that the plant should move from being idle to full production in three hours. That is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the Dabhol equipment is not designed to meet. Then the Central government used this time-limit issue as an excuse for not paying Enron money that was due under the project's finance ministry counter guarantee. 
This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive. 
Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve. 
For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start. 
The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra. 
Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial and management capabilities and reach. 
But time is running out and it does not look as if Enron will wait much longer. If it does terminate the contract - and maybe puts the Dabhol company into bankruptcy - India's image will suffer because of the government's failure to pay the counter guarantees, which could well be presented as the central issue. The only beneficiary of this disaster would be the company that eventually picks up the pieces at Dabhol because it will obtain the project at a knockdown price. 
This may sound as if I am arguing that Enron is in the right. I am not. What I am arguing however is that the Central and state governments have failed to manage this crisis effectively. Instead they are treating it with a characteristic sense of drift - assuming no doubt that, like so many crises in this country, it will solve itself - which it will not. 
If anyone doubts Enron's motive for ridding itself of its India business, just look at its recent first quarter results: profits up 20 per cent to $406 million on sales that had almost quadrupled to $50 billion. Does anyone seriously think that Dabhol matters to such an international commodities trader? 
BUSINESS STANDARD  Friday, May 18, 2001  
Godbole panel not to seek replacements Our Regional Bureau in Mumbai
Chairman of the renegotiation committee appointed to hold discussions with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) Madhav Godbole, on Wednesday said the remaining six members on the committee were adequate to fruitfully continue negotiations with the power major. 
Responding to a query whether the withdrawal by three appointees on the committee -- EAS Sarma, RK Pachouri and Kirit Parikh -- would hamper negotiations with DPC considering their respective expertise in fields of finance and power, Godbole told Business Standard, "I would not like to get into such an argument. As far as the committee is concerned we would not be seeking fresh inductions." He was reacting to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's statement made earlier on Wednesday, wherein he said the government would wait for the chairman of the renegotiation committee to make a requisition for new members on the committee.
Deshmukh also told mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, "We have repeatedly informed the centre of our inability to absorb the DPC power that would become available following the completion of phase II of the project." He also observed that while Maharashtra was keen to ensure the active participation of individual members from the Union finance, energy and legal ministries for a fruitful dialogue process with DPC, the appointment of retired bureaucrat AV Gokak was not clear on some issues.
"Whether Gokak is authorised by the centre with some powers to negotiate on its behalf is not clear as of now. However, with renegotiations currently on, we would like to await the committee's deliberations," he said. The next meeting of the renegotiating committee with DPC is scheduled for May 23.

HAVE A GREAT AFTERNOON

YOU ARE DUMM

Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

Paul
Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to "purchase" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

Paul

How do your calendars look June 7-15 for meeting with the guys from OLNG? They are interested in a visit to CMS. Possibly they could be there for the Hoegh Galleon unloading.

Please let me know your date preferences and the names of anyone else that should attend the meetings.

It is very nice to hear from you. You are in Dallas, right? How is your family?

Well ...  yes I am living in Houston again. I still work for Enron ... I just returned from a business trip to the Middle East and India ... it was interesting but too long.

Guess what ... I got married on March 17th. Guess to whom ... Renee Freyou from Port Neches. Can you believe it!!!

You can call me toll free at my office  1-800-973-6766,  Press 1 to transfer to an extension, Press 55855 for my extension.

It will be great to talk to you. I hope that you are doing very well.

Hi Paul.  I received your message earlier this year and accidentally erased it.  When I called information to get your number, a really young woman (twenty-something) answered the phone number I was given....  She told me I had the wrong number but I'm still wondering...  Anyway, hopefully you'll receive this and reply with your current home number.  Are you still in Puerto Rico?  You'll have to tell me about your experience there.  Let me know if you receive this and I'll write back...  Talk to you soon...

Saldos, 

Rajesh,

Are you coordinating your efforts with Shubh?

Paul

Shubh,

I spoke with Dan today on this issue.  As you and I discussed there are basically two CoU issues that you are pursuing.
A CoU for use at Dabhol.  As Dan suggested in the message below, the CoU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project would probably be a good starting point for the CoU to be used at Dabhol.  However it will need to be coordinated with the other project documents and the DPC/GSC C/P for Lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the P&I insurers for Lakshmi.
We (Enron) has also negotiated a 'short form' of CoU that has been used by Oman LNG for the ships loading Enron's spot cargoes loaded at their terminal.  As Dan has said, since OLNG drives their own CoU we waited until they proposed a CoU and we then negotiated to the final version.  Usually the purchaser waits until the seller presents the CoU and then they negotiate it.  However, we understand that MOL, acting for GSC, want to get this CoU checked off with their P&I insurers so they will have one less thing to do when the ship comes into service.  We could go to OLNG and request their CoU and send it to MOL for them to review with their legal advisers and their P&I.  Alternately we could request that OLNG use for the Lakshmi, the same CoU as we (Enron) have negotiated for the spot cargoes.  Not having been involved in the negotiations, I do not know how they differ or even if GSC will want to use the version used by Enron. 

Dan has said that with the complications now existing with ship lenders and the Dabhol PTN, he is snowed under and is not able to work on CoUs.  Philip Weems of King & Spalding (outside legal assistance) worked on both the MetGas and the Enron spot cargo documents as he has very valuable experience on these issues.  Dan has recommended that DPC use Philip but with the current situation, you may not want to get into additional legal fees or even start an exercise that may be totally in vain.
Please advise of your thoughts on the above.  I will phone you early tomorrow morning, Houston time.
 
Tony

Attached please find a copy of the COU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project.  Please remember that this document is custom-tuned to match-up with the liability, risk and insurance allocation mechanism set out in the MetGas LNG SPA.  This document would probably be a good starting point for the COU to be used under the Oman LNG SPA and the AdGas LNG SPA; however it will need to be coordinated with those documents and ultimately agreed by Greenfield's Marine P&I insurers.   We used Philip Weems of King & Spalding for outside legal assistance on this document (he has very valuable experience on these issues and documents) and recommend for the sake of efficiency and cost savings that we do so on any Dabhol Port COU as well. 

Kind regards,
Dan

Gene,

I have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time.
Are you sure this can be done???? 

For my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales.

Is this the right starting point???

Second, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes:

1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.  

2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. 

Am I close at all????

I hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch.

Lindy,

I hope this is what you need.

The U.S. needs to establish a very, very strong ground troop presence in Afghanistan as soon as possible. Until we accomplish this, we will not win over the Afghan people who would like to be rid of the Taliban. As of today, defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible. We need bases of operation in more than one area of the country. The logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible. The Afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the Taliban. 

We are currently losing the media war. If our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the Afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world, we would start winning the war of words. 

We must control ground very soon. There will be casualties on our side and the American people must prepare themselves mentally. We are fighting a ruthless, brutal enemy. Our resolve must increase, not diminish, when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens. We must take down the Taliban and Bin Laden and other terrorists around the globe or face more attacks and loss of life in the United States.

FYI

I tried to send out an email to you from home last week but received an error while sending.  So I'll try again (sorry for the delay in my response).

This contract was negotiated at a one-part daily rate of $0.1100/dth.  However, because the shipper's usage each month was significantly lower than the contracted mdq, they were billed less than the contracted rate (using the applicable max tariff rates for demand and usage).

I reviewed the invoices for the time period May 2001 - September 2001 and these are the results regarding necessary adjustments:

May 2001 - ok
June 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery points #58710 and #500084 ($568.87)
July 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
August 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
September 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($189.00) and delete the Credit for Commodity on reservation invoice ($251.10)

NOTE:  The GRI adjustments do not impact TW's bottom line because the monies collected from PNM for these surcharges are passed through to the Gas Research Institute.  The only impact to our revenue is the deletion of the Credit for Commodity.

Please let me know when you are ready to make the rate adjustments and I can walk you through the process.  Then we can get with the schedulers to re-generate these invoices.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Hi Paul,

I'd like to get some more information before following up on your request.

Could you please provide the following so I can research this.
1. Effective Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/1998 
2. Effective End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	10/19/2001 
3. Ref Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/2002 
4. Ref End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	12/31/2006 
5. Publication [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG 
6. Curve Code [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG

[Y'Barbo, Paul]  Also, since my note yesterday, I found price data on 09/30/2000 (a Saturday) in the data that was returned to me. Those prices were the same as those on 09/29/2000. I am most concerned with the prices given for 09/16/2001 (a Sunday). It is easy enough to delete those prices. Are the prices on 09/17/2001 to 10/19/2001 good? 

Sorry to ask for these again, but these specifics are needed to analyze the data that was returned to you.

Krishna,

I modified the file you sent to me (see attached). For OPT TYPE, what is the code for a Call? for a Put?

How does this modified model look? The data is monthly prices. I changed the formula for Vol. Did I get it right?

Paul

 

Probably yes. Paulo Issler in our Research group maintains the exotica files, contact him for details on those files. exotica1 is probably a backup file.
Krishna.

Krishna,

Do you mean the /Research/Exotica/xll directory? Is the exotica1.xll addin the same as the exotica.xll addin?

Paul

Here is what we had done for Kim before. In the PGE_Permian.xls file, the option values are in cells starting M30. In Excel, you need to load the exotica.xll addin which is in /Research/Exotica directory on your common drive. Load the addin and say NO to "copy to your local drive?" Also, see the "Results" sheet for volatility and correlation calculations.

Krishna,

Please see attached data on the pages named "MO IND DATA" and "Basis Forwards". I am interested in understanding the math associated with valuing calls and puts on the spread between the index points. Also, do you have an option pricing model that I could have? My office number is 5-4173.

Thanks,

Maricely,

In the attached file, there is a list of the LPG cargoes from Dynegy. I am trying to confirm that EcoElectrica has received each cargo's Bill of Lading. They should have been received in the last few months.

Thanks,

Paul

 

Suzanne,

Please see attached. We still need to see what prices do for the remainder of the month before we finalise the pricing tied to Nov-Jan. 

Thanks,

Hello,

I am a Tax Analyst currently working on Co. 102's (The Protane Corporation) and Co. 214's (Citadel Corporation Limited) federal tax returns. I need the following four issues resolved to complete their tax returns. If you are not the correct accountant(s), could you please tell me who is? I would appreciate this information by Friday, April 27.

It appears that on November 3, 2000 Co. 214 sold its 100% interest in Co. 218 (Citadel Venezolana, S.A.) to Co. 102 for 8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars. (If you need documentation for your research, I have the interoffice memo concerning this transaction.) There are four issues I have with this transaction:

1) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 still has an Investment in Subsidiary balance of $1,760,000 and Equity Earnings of $494,508.83 relating to Co. 218. Should not these balances be $0? Also would there have been an intercompany gain/loss associated with this stock sale? 

2) As of 12/31/00, Co. 102 shows no Investment in Subsidiary nor Equity Earnings balance relating to Co. 218. Should not there be a balance for Co. 218 which equals the USD equivalent of $8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars? Also, should not the Equity Earnings ($494,508.83) from Co. 218 posted on Co. 214 be posted on Co. 102?

3) As of 12/31/00, Co. 218 shows capital stock of $1,760,000 owned by Co. 214. Should not this capital stock be shown to be owned by Co. 102?

4) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 is showing a $6,000,000 entry in "Other Deductions" (The credit side of the journal entry hits "Deferred Credits.").  I need more detail concerning this amount. Could this be the consideration received from Co. 102 relating to the stock sale mentioned above?

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your time,
Khrissy Griffin

I will be attending.

Please let me know if you plan on attending the training session tomorrow, as I must have the administrative assistant order lunch for those people attending.

Thanks Suzanne. Elio is aware of your concern regarding damage to relations with PDVSA at this critical time.

Paul

Paul, in comparing freight rates for Med vs Caribs and Caribs vs Caribs (cargo size), I do see Bo's point.  

For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.:
	$50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and 
 	$60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs

however,

the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows:
	$30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and
	$40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs

So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to 
Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00.

Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better.

Let me know your thoughts.

Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.  I would hesitate to purchase from an alternative source lest they back off on other negotiations.

Best regards,
Suzanne

You are much better at this than you think. Anytime you have an idea that you'd like me to consider or any questions, feel free to bring me into the loop. 

Did you notice in your e-mail that you now have an EnronOnline ID and Password? I can show you how to access it and find the quotes you need when you are ready.

Paul

P.S. Have a great weekend!!!

thanks so much teacher; I truly appreciate your feedback/thoughts.  I think the Progasco thing is a good point; we shall consider it.
Thanks a lot again. Mariella
ps: sorry if I'm a bit slow on these things but I'm just now getting used to thinking on these terms.

Miguel,

As we analyze what and how to deal with your next cargo requirements, we need the following information:

-	Current levels of inventory at Procaribe, broken down between your own and Eco's product - projected as of end of September (please provide basis; i.e., levels of as of the actual date that you provide data plus your projections through end of the month on withdrawals/uses)
-	Projected sales volumes for the months of  October, November, December and January of next year, including (and this is very critical!) the basis for your projections.  I am going to be interested in looking at your assumptions for both Progasco (now Tropigas) and Empire volumes, if any.
-	Please ensure that your San Juan Gas volumes have been signed off by Federico.

We need this data as soon as you can so that we can begin to look at cargo options and/or evaluate the decision to borrow from Eco.

Thanks and Regards, Mariella

Paul,

Believe it or not (yes, call me crazy!), I went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were so kind to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions, which I would like for you to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process.  

-	First, given the added uncertainty of Procaribe's volumes (sales) now that Progasco is owned by someone else, unless Miguel can guarantee (through some form of written agreement) that he will have Progasco's volumes, I think we should be more open to or more inclined to borrow Eco's volumes (clearly, we wouldn't do so if the curve looks awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization).
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Without the Progasco volume, it will take much longer to sell-off this cargo. The hedging would be different. If Humberto unexpectedly showed up to buy, the timing of our hedge would be off. I think we should sign-up Humberto for Nov-Dec at whatever we can get. Come January it will be a new ballgame as Empire will need to get a new contract with PDVSA. We could probably up our price at that time.

-	Second, it seems to me that you wouldn't me too inclined to try to fix the cost of your product bought from, say, PDVSA, unless you are very concerned about an increasing curve (right around the 3 days surrounding the bill of lading) that will not necessarily stay long enough to keep your "sales" curve up to guarantee a margin.  In fact, you would likely wait and continue to watch the curve and either not act at all or act shortly before the bill of lading dates.  Now, in your May hedging example, if you actually compare the hedged vs. non-hedged results, it tells you that you were better off with a no hedge on the earlier months (month for which data on the revenue side was known and most of the curve deciding your price to PDVSA was also known).  Then, my question is: why did we decide to hedge that volume when the hedge was put in place on 5/9, only a week or so before the actual bill of lading date? Do you remember what was concerning us?
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
You would hedge the purchase cost if you were going to be repaying borrowings and you liked the price you could lock-in. Also, as you say, if you were concerned that prices during your sales period would not hold their value relative to the 3-days around B/L. Yes, we missed $0.003/gallon by hedging the part of the cargo that was sold in April and early May. We were not particularly concerned about anything. Just wanted to be rid of the possibility that prices could have gone up a penny or two.

-	Third, it seems to me that, on the May hedge, (the second part of the volume) someone lost big time - I could be wrong, but what I'm looking at is the fix we got (Suzanne got) in return for the floating; the fix rate was much higher than the actual MBv figures for the months of June and July (this assumes of course the Enron didn't turn around and laid off that risk on someone else).  What I am trying to say is that, there appears to have been something going on with the curve on or around 5/21 that changed dramatically once actual figures were recorded.  Do you remember?  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
LPG prices dropped dramatically in June going below $0.35 per gallon. Normally, no one in Enron would get hurt because Lee Jackson would have hedged himself with someone outside of the company. However, he actually left his position open and lost about $300k. That does not impact us.

-	Fourth, it seems to me that your swaps were being built around a primary objective (beyond risk protection): to deliver approximately 5 cents per gallon margin to Miguel.  Anytime we have that opportunity, we should grab it.  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Yes, I want to lock the margin but if possible I like to improve it to above the $0.05.

That's all for now - - I'll keep studying this ... What I am trying to do is draw some conclusions as to the circumstances under which we will want to swap the purchase cost (it's clear to me that, most of the times, once you know what your cost is, you will try to lock in your margin by doing a swap using your revenue stream; i.e., the Mbv basis).

Thanks again for all your time and patience.

Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

So do you think things are proceeding well ?

My guys tell me we are just about finished on our end and will be getting 
ready to beta test. How are your folks doing ?

I will be running the power options desk with UBS. I will still be trading gas though. how about you ?

This looks good. what were the system vols and when can you get me the rest ?

We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement.

same plan

cool go for it.

close enough for 5 9's, no ?

no interest.

I know Steve Murray quite well.

Add Barrick Gold to your list. They like Enron, and Bruce Garner has had extensive discussions with them.

what would be the product the Sabre would list ? I like the name but can't see the business idea; help me out.

where are we at with them ?

Please work with the group so that I am no longer inundated with erequests for additional mailbox space.

andy zipper
john lavorato
dutch quigley
larry may
mike maggi

how does this relate to what we are working on with them ?

When will we have a draft available fo distribution to Accenture ?

Unfortunately I will not be attending, but I would like to participate via videocon.

This is my simplistic first take:

 

Bloomberg has come back to the table with us and are being good boys so far. So I don't have a problem issuing them a EnronOnline journalist ID to view your prices. Thanks for the cooperation.

Andy

1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).

I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.

Congratulations !

Now let's focus on closing the deal and getting someone else signed up.

Well done all.

huh ?

700 NM, 4 hrs total

 good luck.

Let's you and I get together for lunch today, and do the same with Brad tomorrow.

I will be participating by videocon.

Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice,
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip,
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, and Swiss Miss.
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to
help us realize this opportunity.
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us.
Well done, Russ!

Travis McCullough
Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in the
Enron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.

	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the
assumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.

	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex
Application is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.

	There may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most
of it.

	Travis, I will call you tomorrow afternoon.

	Best regards,

	Ted

John,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

AZ

Can I get a Reuters screen as well ?

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

AZ

Still does not work.

please...

Next steps are he gets me a contract for the API, and lets me know when they are meeting on mid and back. 

Let's table this for now. Too much going on.

On another note: Where do we stand with TFS ?

Heard you had ended up at Allegheny. In NYC or Hagerstown MD ?

Drop me a line, I want to discuss something with you.

Hope all is well.

Andy

Arvind,
The propoer contact at Enron for you is Jay Webb. He can be reached at jay.webb@enron.com. I will foward this to him.

Good Luck,
Andy Zipper

Over to you.
Hi Andy

Hope you have had a chance to review our earlier details and hopefully it
would have given you further insights into our capabilities.

During the recent Board meeting with Goldman Sachs, our Enron strategy was
discussed and we indicated our correspondance with you. All of us are very
exited and working on ways of initiating the process. Moreover, due to the
strategic nature of partnership, our Management has also decided to invest
in developing this association.

I would discuss the proposition (from our Senior Management) during a
telecon and you could assess the feasibility.

Meanwhile, some areas that we are currently working with Goldman Sachs,
Nortel, Chevron, HP, etc are indicated below and we could replicate the same
with Enron:

1.	Module Development or enhancements to existing applications
      - Portal
      - Adaptor/Connector Development
      - Integrating online trading apps with Back End systems
      - Ariba customization/enhancements
      - Content Management
      - e-Procurement &  EBPP
      - other application specific integration

2.	Maintenance & enhancements (Could be done in India for cost saving
and round the clock operations)
3.	Re-engineering, Migration and porting for your existing applications

4.	QA

Andy, we are confident that this proposition of ours would be very
attractive and would go a long way in developing a strong association.

Could we discuss our business proposition this week ? I could call your
admin assistant tommorow (6/5) and fix up a suitable time for the call (10 -
15 Minutes Max.) We could follow this up with a technical meeting to
identify specific areas, should you feel comfortable with our proposition.

Looking forward to our discussions.

Thks, Arvind

require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

dave forster.

I need this deal closed by month end.

why are we bothering with LOC, I thought we had moved past that ?

Why wouldn't we use the deal bench auction platform ? This provides for open auctions with participants changing their bids in real time, no ?

Please remove me from your contact list. Thank You.

Not enough of a background in finance. Thanks and keep trying.

Stewart,

It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.

Andy Zipper
Enron Networks

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well 

Andy

looks good. what are vector's major receipt and delivery points ?

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy

jeff said he does not have access to trade emissions allowances. if he indeed does not, please turn him on for those. if he does, let me know. thanks.

I understand; however my request stands. I would like a heads up whenever you are planning a trip like this, it is the same I ask of all my direct reports.

Thanks

John,
On the first note: OK, thanks.

On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
AZ

I realize that traveling to see a client is part of our job. I would just ask that we try to spend those expense dollars as efficiently and conscientiously as possible.

Thanks,
AZ

Mike's thoughts on subject...

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

What is, exactly, the state of play here ? I nothing else happens, on Monday does the product go up on the wallboard ? Has Eddie quoted on px to the Merc ? I need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between Whalley ,Arnold and Lavorato.

Thanks, are we talking to GreatLakes pipepline as well ?

do we have a contract in front of them yet ?

Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).

For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

Harry Arora

Why is Mr. Frank Alexander interested intalking to me ? Furthermore who is he ?

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.

Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ 

Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

I talked with Greg and he and bibi are for it. Start the process with Guadaramma but keep it close to the vest as it is not official with the DealBench folks.

thanks. 

Wasn't me.

Do we want to make this official ?

 
Give Raj a call.

I do not want my name in the article. Please use Greg Piper's or Phillipe Bibi's.

Thanks for the note. Awaiting your review and response.

I keep getting asked for a username,password and domain name. What do I put in these fields to get access ?

Kenny, Peggy, Mike,

We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June. We can move as fast as you need us to. Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?

Thanks
AZ

My pleasure.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

You're right he does look good. I am very interested. Can you set up a phone interview, and if that goes well bring him down for rounds.

Stu,

When you get a chance can you gice me a call re: the above and Natsource. I'm around most of tomrrow so any old time is fine with me.

Thanks
Andy

thanks.

I agree. The whole thing is a sham.

FYI
I think this warrants some investigation

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these "custom" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these "custom" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

Torrey

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.

Andy

Stewart,

I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? "

The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.

For what it is worth.

Andy 

I agree completely. We are the delivery vehicle for Kiodex.

I hear Shell....

I got this from ICE. Thought you should have a look at it.

It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking "responsible" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.

I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.

	I sold 2,000/d of apr/oct @ 3.19, and 2,000/d @ 3.18. Please put these in the ng-opt book, not the jv book.

Thanks

Jay,
Thanks for the help.

Andy

It has the  hO numbers but not the Cl numbers.

Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.

I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks
Andy

Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.

I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...

How is yor flying going ?

Congratulations on the new job !

Good luck,

to be honest this looks a little to convoluted to me. a nov/mar peiod for weather versus a jan-feb-mar basis ? I pass on this.

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

Hi Andy,

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

Thanks!

When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival." 

I don't know whom you are referring to. do you mean the fundy's group ?

Small issue but annoying:

If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.

Hope all is well otherwise,

Andy

The world is short and covering. PIRA today issued bullish comments. don't know whee we go from here. Vol got bid up in winter huge today. 

Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus
TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. "Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. "And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria." Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

               reset trigger: 3.35
       

The mechanics of the swap are as follows:  It is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger. In that case that month and only that month's reference price resets to the new price as specified in "resets to." all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.
                
Let me know if you have questions.

Liz,

How did you end up with Robert Jones on this ?

Andy

how about 3:15 in front of plaza java ?

i asked ina rangel to send it to you.

sure. what time ?

Dave,

Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know. 

Regards,
Andy 

I think it relates to Paul not getting the top job in their soon to be spun off unregulated unit. That job went to some guy named Shockley who Eric Vanderwald will report to. Their press release makes for fun reading.

Don't know if you saw it, but your friend and mine Paul Addis is leaving AEP to "pursue other interests".

Liz,
Greg was interested in where to make contributions in the wake of Johnathan's death. He worked with eSpeed. Below is the information he requested.

In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. 
``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

Who did it?     Foreign Report presents an alternative view 

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and 
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, 
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad 
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the 
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. 

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the 
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be 
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside 
Afghanistan. 

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources

claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling

between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri. According 
to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah Suleiman, was 
captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan. 
The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad 
Mughniyeh. 

"We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture," admits one 
intelligence source, "but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some

of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the 
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri, 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi 
Intelligence Service (SSO)." 

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th 
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli 
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport with

the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when it 
accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but 
Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special "gift" to 
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh. 

'A psychopath' 

"Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh," says an Israeli who

knows Mughniyeh . "The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his two

brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation." 

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds. "In recent months, there was a change, 
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up 
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)." 

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the 
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved. 

Mughniyeh, 48, is a "sick man", says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the

most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several governments 
and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head. 

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract] 

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made 
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the

head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping triggered

what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried to exchange 
Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt ended in a 
fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley 
with his own hands. 

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh 
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them was

his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran. 

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later.

According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action and, in a 
well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the Israeli embassy 
in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were killed. Only last 
year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a warrant for 
Mughniyeh's arrest. 

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car 
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were 
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of 
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life 
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge. 

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in 
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? "To fight 
these bastards you don't need a military attack," said an experienced 
Israeli commando officer. "You only need to adopt Israel's assassination 
policy." 

Some interesting facts and info... 

Hello friends, 

For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe.  The victims 
will not be forgotten.  

I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come.  Or perhaps I'm ranting you decide... 

My first reactions like many others were decimation, 
selected occupation, no more standing military, slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity.  This has worked 
before, but will it now?  On terrorism and 
intelligence, I think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law; we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations (i.e., our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people, or have moles on the payroll). 

After a few days of kill 'em all mentality, I decided 
to begin my education in this matter.  I would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions. 
 I do feel more informed.  My resolve is no different; 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated. 

Domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember.  There is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world.  In the late 1980's it was 
as high as 2 events a day. 
This is terrorism.  From Colin Powell himself.  I 
found myself numb before I event got through the first 
months of 2000.

List of major terrorist organizations - they will all 
need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first 
targets. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000>  
Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian 
Islamic Jihad, some members of al-Gama'at 
al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and 
the Harakat ul-Mujahidin. 

Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
Laden, financially his network is like a holding 
company.  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below.  Each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups.  Most of these are fundamental 
Islamic extremist organizations.  A fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments, establish fundamentalist 
Islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders, wage war on western 
influence internally,  and potentially engage in 
military actions against the United States and other 
western nations. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm

These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin 
Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans.

Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the 
region. 
http://www.randmcnally.com <http://www.randmcnally.com>  
I found the geography interesting to study in detail. 
Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access.  The 
ocean-to-land access is through Pakistan's Arabian Sea 
coast; then head North 800 miles, to Peshawar and then 
into Kabul (the mountainous route the British used in 
1946).  The Pakistan army is 50% Taliban sympathetic. 
Already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help America.  They will descend into civil war most 
surely.  The HUM will likely be a significant part of 
that problem.  It will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military. 
Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by 
renegades within their own army?  

Things we should know: 
In Pakistan, many Afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) in 
the 1980's to fight the Soviets.  They were called the 
Mujahideen.  Many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited, having known nothing else in 
this world.  Left to their own devices for 10 years, 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations (HUM) and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements (the 
Taliban).  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime, 
killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul 
for several days.  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat; 
they terrorize other Muslim communities, the Hazaras 
and Hindu Kush people within their borders.    The 
Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan 
Hindus to wear identifications tags.  Sound familiar? 
The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida, bin Laden's 
organization.   bin Laden also influences the 
fundamentalist (IMU) in Uzbekistan.  The IMU is 
another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzistan, and Tajikistan, north of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
Pushtun region.  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.; There have been movements to create a 
separate Pushtunistan.  This map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg>
. 
 And the HUM focuses their attacks on India. 

The Shi'ite Muslims, many other Sunni Muslims, and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.  The 
Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women, total eliminations of all modern culture, and 
being the worlds largest heroin production.  The 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups. 

Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to it's 
West.  Iran is an Shi'a or Shi'ite Muslim nation. 
Because Iran is predominantly Shi'a; they are 
unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated 
Afghanistan.  Iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of Shi'a Muslims, including Iranian 
diplomats in Afghanistan.  Iran also has border 
disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a 
devastating 8 year war.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 
25 million people; Iran is closer to 65 million.

Also during the war with Soviet over 10 MILLION land 
mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left 
behind.  
http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/
<http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/>  

The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern 
Military Alliance.  These people are also Sunni Muslim 
and ethnically are the Tajiks.  Their leader Massoud 
was killed last week, assassinated by men posing as 
the press.  The sliver of Afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China. 
The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban 
without initiating conflict with Tajikistan.  The NMA 
is a political authority that may be put in place. 
They have offered 15000 soldiers, and 15000 more on 
reserve.  Their leader was killed last week, most 
likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new 
requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the Afghan bank.  Many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event. 

I have also been seeking out information on the 
Taliban in particular.  These link contain some very 
powerful information.  Quite frankly it is shameful 
that the Western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many 
years ago. 

First a super high level overview - it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders.

Try to digest this information - it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue.  But the Taliban 
must go. 

This section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways. 
The nations in question will need to eradicate, expel 
extremists from within their own borders.  This means 
partnering with a United States led coalition and 
contributing emphatically. 

Look at the Mediterranean coast. 
The South - Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism. 
The East - Israel, Lebanon, Syria  all plagued by 
terrorist groups.  There is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization.  Beirut was once a beautiful 
city I am told; For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city. 
Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other 
organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS. 

Look at the Red Sea. 
Egypt,Sudan and Saudi Arabia.  The Sudan is terribly 
infiltrated; this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven.  And while the Saudi's are 
economically partnered with the western world, many 
extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these 
organizations.  Sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network.  

Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea 
Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast, site of 
the USS Cole bombing.  After the attack, the 
perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan. 

Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both 
acknowledge the Taliban government.  They have 
provided radical nationals to the Afghans, throughout 
the years, many support the Taliban; some trained with 
bin Laden.  We hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban. 
Iran, Persia until 1935, has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north.  We have 
had problems with Iran in the past; in the current 
situation, they may be helpful maybe not.  There is 
information pointing to an Islamic conference in 
Tehran which is another possible "hatching" ground for 
these operations.  Iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future.  It is a religious government - 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation. 
They exiled the Shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932. 
Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey. 
Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals, the Kurds in the North near the Turkish 
border.  As we know, he has invaded Kuwait.  An 8 year 
war with Iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in Afghanistan.  This is a 
military regime.  Though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as 
military force; they have created a new generation of 
hatred. 

East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea, part of the 
Indian Ocean, the Arabian basin is separated from the 
Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel. 
Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war.  A 
military regime. Probably half of the people in the 
army are Taliban sympathizers.  Pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly. 
India - the largest democracy in the world.  Still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System.  The 
British occupation left India with an intact system of 
representative government.  They are plagued by 
internal strife from the Sikh, who are separatists. 
Their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years.  They are also plagued by 
the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement 
- very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden 
as described earlier. 

China actually shares a thin strip of border with 
Afghanistan near Tajikistan.  Pakistan also borders on 
China.  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of China. 
Having China on board is critical. 

I would like the US to investigate TSI, Telephone 
Services International, a New Jersey Corporation and 
Unocal, a California Oil Company.  Both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the Taliban 
government.  I believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly.  And I think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations.  The investment community was hit 
particularly hard; i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans. 
We may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity.  By all means, no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
Taliban; perhaps this should be enforced by law. 

Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND! 
I firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
America is part of the problem. 
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology, 
Banking, Law and Medicine for a very long time.  The 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions, and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous.  The average American 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill.  

Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign;  I 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on.  Our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian.  We need to get every American to study this 
condition, it's roots, causes, directions and what we 
can do to end it.  Americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue, around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution.  Our military domination is 
already known throughout the world. 

Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate, tolerant and peace-loving; they 
need something to lose, and conversely, something to 
protect.  To get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the Taliban, under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever. 
We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders.  We 
need to seize assets, disable communications, engage 
in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign.   

Let's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom, an 
opinion from within.  While I trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs,  I never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable. 

Know the enemy. The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are.

<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html>  

There is one company in America that is contracted by 
the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine, the BioPort 
Corporation, formerly known as the Michigan Biologic 
Products Institute (MBPI).  I hope the defense around 
that company is solid. 

Hopefully, this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively, tacitly or otherwise.  bin 
Laden  Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas  

operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman 

  Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible

and the Taliban should go first, then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above.  Then what 
Hussein, Qaddafi?  Will Egypt be on board when the Al 
Jihad unleash terror in Egypt?  Do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders, completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured?  Is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror? Where 
do we draw the line?  I suppose where you stand after 
Tuesday is a good start?  Who's next?  How do we 
prioritize? Will they are be lined up behind the US in 
1 year? 

Be strong,  Be prepared, Be smart, Be heard, God Bless 
America

GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. "His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. "He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow." The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.

Let's do it.Sorry I didn't get the messages but lets's have dinner next tuesday if that works for you.

no problem. they seem okay so far.

Monica,

Things are a little bit unsettled right now. I am working on them and will have something shortly.
Your patience is appreciated.

Andy Zipper

Can I please get an NG run asap. Thanks.

Thanks, I think I am okay, but let's talk tonight.

Andy,

We pulled the log ... found the guy ... and told him to knock it off.  
Please let me know if there is a repeat performance.  

Best regards, Jeff

 

	

Enron does not place NYMEX position limits on its desks instead using overall VAR limits. If a desk is authorized to trade a particular instrument, such as a NYMEX contract or swap, the size of that position is governed by the VAR it generates.

Hate to pile on but I think KM is circling the drain here. I told your mom a couple of weeks ago that there is high probablility they file chpt 11 by end of first quarter. Get out while you can. Hope boarding went well for you and you didn't break anything.

Andy

Spoke with Rick Stuckey who advised me that a group of seven of them will be arriving today. They would like to heave specific discussions regarding the Pro forma as well as EnronOnline technology starting monday morning. Rick also adivsed me that they are amending the original term sheet that they disucssed with Greg Saturday night.

I will keep you posted.

   Robert, Here are the two messages from "Jeff Lawson" and the response I got from Jeff Sprecher at the ICE regarding my complaint. I appreciate your handling this matter.

Andy

I'm sorry, I did not get it. Thnigs have taken an interesting turn here, give me a call.

yes.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend
Andy

I received this, this morning. I know you are busy right now with other things but I would really like this thing to stop.

Dave,
This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

Andy Zipper
 

Dave,

I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.

Andy

Andy,

Here is the curves that were used to calc the 9/30 Cost of Funds for EWS.

				Greg x35399

 

I don't know if Bob hillier talked to you yet, but I need Stack and Option manager set up on a stand alone machine. I am moving to the power options group as of tomorrow.

My cell is 713 419 0203. Call with questions.

Work for me.

i'm considering this terminated.

I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name.

Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

Andy

I think I have to take my son to the doctor @ noon. Any way we can do Tuesday ?

Either Monday or Tuesday works for me. Sure on the bond guy. His name is Bob Warner. He is with Commerce Capital Markets, the broker sub of Commerce Bank, a big New Jersey Regional. His number is (732) 505-2919.  He is located in Toms River NJ. I will call him if you would like and tell him you are coming his way.
 
Let me know,
Andy

Given the fact that we still have a significant number of transactions that are not captured on EOL, my answer would be thanks but no thanks.

AZ
Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

Dec 15 

I shall be traveling on two other days. One of these trips is related to 
recruiting at CMU.

Vince

Cindy,

I am in Wharton on December 6. Other days prior to Dec 6 are OK.

Vince

Good morning Vince,

Christie has suggested that I be the liaison for John Martin and your 
research project 'Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself'.  

In John's lastest email, he suggested that the first week of December works 
with his schedule - up to December 6th - or the following couple of weeks 
after Dec. 8th.  Do these dates work for you as well?  If so, I will proceed 
in booking one hour sessions with the following Enron management:

Ken Lay
Jeff Skilling
Andy Fastow

If these dates do not work for you let me know when you are available and I 
will try to coordinate with John, Jeff, Ken and Andy.  Also, I will send an 
introductory email to John.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you,

Cindy Derecskey

Alison,

Thanks a lot.

Vince

   

I promise we will do everything we can.  Right now Kristin's assistant, Alyse 
Herasimchuk,  has a call the Cornell career office to put him on the 
schedule.  If that doesn't work, Kristin will ask for the interviewers to 
stay longer to interview him.  Will let you know as soon as we do. 

Thanks for everything you do for us.

Alison,

I appreciate it. I really need your help on this one. His father is very 
helpful in my recruiting 
efforts at Berkeley.

Vince

   

CORRECTION - I was going too fast last night ( You said Cornell not Carneige 
Mellon). Cornell interviews are Monday, October 30 & Tuesday, October 31.  We 
are faxing Shmuel Oren's resume to Kristin and checking to see if  there is 
any time on the closed schedule, or if the interviewers will stay longer to 
include him.  I will let you know today if we can make it work.

Sorry my first e-mail was incorrect.

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Cindy,

Yes, I shall co-author this paper and I have planted  the idea in John 
Martin's head.

Vince

Vince,

I forgot to inquire whether you would also like to be present during the 
interview process with John Martin and Ken, Jeff and Andy? 

Let me know....thanks,

Cindy

Cindy,

This is our preliminary review of the documentation sent by Mr. Patteson.

One more person will take a look at it.

Vince

Stinson Gibner
10/25/2000 01:16 PM
Vince,

After reviewing the documents furnished by Mr. Patteson,  I do not feel that 
Enron should consider engaging in any testing, development, or licensing of 
his proposed generator for the following reasons:

1.  Enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing 
electrical generation equipment and does not plan, as far as I know, to enter 
this business.   The one exception is our ownership in entities developing 
wind and solar, renewable energy.

2.  Enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop 
Mr. Pattesons proposed generator.

3.  There could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would 
involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure.

4.  I do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant 
quantity of electrical power.   The generator produces power by induction.  
That is, electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field.   The 
mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic 
dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium.   As the boiling will 
produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid, the "movement" or change in 
the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing 
a steady or reliable electrical current.

I have asked Martin Lin to also review the documents to render an independent 
opinion of this proposal.

Respectfully,

Dr. Stinson Gibner
PhD. Physics
P.S.   Kevin and Zimin:  If you have any interest in reviewing Mr. Patteson's 
proposal, please let me know.

Stinson,

Can you please take a quick look and fwd it to Sam
Smith (wsmith2@enron.com)

The question remains, why conditional orders tend tocluster at certain =20

1.  AT&T fired President John Walter after nine months, saying
he lacked intellectual leadership."  He received a $26
million severance package.  Perhaps it's not Walter who's
lacking intelligence.

2.  WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS!  Police in Oakland,
California spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman who
had barricaded himself inside his home.After firing ten tear
gas canisters, officers discovered that the man was standing
beside them, shouting "Please come out and give yourself up."

3.  WHAT WAS PLAN B???  An Illinois man pretending to have a
gun kidnapped a motorist and forced him to drive to two
different automated teller machines.  The kidnapper then
proceeded to withdraw money from his own bank accounts.

4.  THE GETAWAY!  A man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik
Stop, and asked for all the money in the cash drawer.
Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up the store
clerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until
police showed up and grabbed him.

5.  DID I SAY THAT???  Police in Los Angeles had good luck
with a robbery suspect who just couldn't control himself during
a lineup.  When detectives asked each man in the lineup to
repeat the words, "Give me all your money or I'll shoot,"  the
man shouted, "that's not what I said!"

6.  ARE WE COMMUNICATING??  A man spoke frantically into
the phone, "My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only
two minutes apart!"  "Is this her first child?" the doctor  asked.
"No!" the man shouted, "This is her husband!"

7.  NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER!!  In Modesto, CA,
Steven Richard King was arrested for trying to hold up a Bank
of America branch without a weapon.  King used a thumb and a
finger to simulate a gun, but unfortunately, he failed to keep
his hand in his pocket.

8.  THE GRAND FINALE This is a true story!  Last summer,down
on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour east of
Bakersfield, California, some folks, new to boating, were
having a problem. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't
get their brand new 22-ft. Bayliner to perform.  It wouldn't get
on a plane at all, and it was very sluggish in almost every
maneuver, no matter how much power was applied.After about an
hour of trying to make it go, they putted over to a nearby
marina, thinking someone there could tell them what was wrong.  A
thorough topside check revealed everything in perfect working
order.  The engine ran fine, the outdrive went up and down,
the prop was the correct size and pitch.  So, one of the marina
guys jumped in the water to check underneath.  He came up choking
on water, he was laughing so hard.  REMEMBER, THIS IS TRUE.....
Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer.

Vince,

The A/A program does not have a contract in place with Melly Language 
Services.  It appears that by the note below from my contact in the A/A-HR 
department, the reimbursement policy appears to be driven by department, not 
Enron at large.

As I mentioned earlier, if I continue with my current tutor, but outside of 
the Melly Language Services, the cost to the department will decrease for me 
to take French classes.

Pls advise if Research will be able to continue to fund my lessons.

Many thanks,

Gwyn Koepke

	
	

Gwyn,

In the past the Associate & Analyst program use to pick-up the cost for the 
classes, but they stopped doing so effective 1/99.  (Although, some business 
units decided to continue paying for it - you may want to double check with 
your business unit to whether or not they have a contract.  The A/A dept does 
not.)   Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thank you for your patience.
Sincerely,
Ivonne Brown

Gwyn Koepke
10/19/2000 08:25 PM
Ivonne,

I am currently enrolled in a french language class thru Enron and Melly's 
Language Services, and my group is paying the cost directly.

I am considering quitting the Melly's Language Program in favor of an outside 
private tutor, for a number of reasons.  It will be cheaper too.

I would like to know:

1.  Does Enron have a contract in place with Melly's Language Service, to be 
the exclusive provider of language services to Enron?

2.  Will Enron pay the costs of my language classes if they are held outside 
of the Melly contract (if any)?

I just want to make sure that if I decide to "drop out" of the Melly classes 
and sign up for other private tutoring courses, which will be less expensive 
than the Melly Svc, that Enron will not have a problem picking up the tab.  
Vince Kaminski, the MD, wants to know this, to ensure there is no legal 
restriction on who must provide these language services in order to secure 
Enron reimbursement.

Thanks for your help.

back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me
to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for
this.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Paul,

Thanks a lot.

Last night, I tested our new system for real-time surveillance and messaging 
of the weather, and it delivers the data to desktops throughout the building 
more than 6 1/2 minutes before the National Weather Service updates their 
webpages. Our current technology was web-scraping these pages via ftp, then 
parsing into a database. The impact of these 6 1/2 minutes for the hourly 
power traders is enormous- the weather stations upload their data around 53 
minutes after the hour, and we can now receive them within 2 minutes later. 
We can now re-estimate our nonlinear stack model before the top of the hour, 
when hourly power trading begins. Otherwise, we would not have model results 
until around 15 minutes after the hour. Notably, hourly power trading is, for 
all intents and purposes, concluded by then (they trade for 10-15 minutes and 
manage the scheduling for the next 30 or so miutes). So, effectively, we may 
now be one *hour* ahead of where we were just a few days ago, in terms of 
information. People are very excited up here, from the CTO on down- thanks 
for letting it happen.

Stanford Team, 

We have received yet another acceptance - Noah Jacobs has accepted our offer 
as a summer associate.  We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers.  I have sent 
Paul Kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking 
in on him next week.  Also Eric Cope, a Stanford student that Vince 
Kaminski's group had interviewed here in Houston for a summer associate 
position has also accepted.  All in all our Stanford numbers are looking 
great!

Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!

Andrzej,

I shall be in the Bay area again  for Thanksgiving. I came to SF for one day 
to
do recruiting at Berkeley. I hope you will feel better soon.

Vince

Wicku,
I hoped to hear from you. Please, let me know whether your plans have
changed, and if so, when you are coming to Palo Alto.

I spent theer weeks in Europe in September (had dinner with Leszek and Ewa),
and went to Sydney as a guest of NBC. Upon return I caught a flu, and
travelled heavily congested to New York, which led to some ear
problems.Consequently I intend to stay put for several weeks, and will have
to reschedule my trip to Houston for Dec. or January. Hope to see you here
before then.
Best to all three of you.
Andrzej

Andrzej,

Thanks. Please, send me the information about the dates
when you plan to visit Houston. Also, the information about
your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
about the other members of your team) would be useful.

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Please have your presentations to me by 10 AM Friday, October 20, 2000.   It 
takes a couple of days to get the materials back from the Copy Center. The 
presentations have to be put in new binders this time and it takes most of a 
day to put everything together in the binders.  Therefore, I  have to have 
the materials to the Copy Center by Friday afternoon in order to get them 
back by Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning.  I will need most of Tuesday to 
get everything assembled in the binders.  Thus the necessity of having your 
completed presentations by Friday morning.

I would like to  invite him to an interview next week. We should use his home 
phone
number and/or private E-mail address.

Vince

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

My home phone number is 913-649-0578, Dr. Kaminski, I will wait your call in
this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

Molly,

We are in process of setting up an interview.

Dr. Lew:   Vince Kaminski has asked me to contact you in connection with your 
interest in Enron.   He would like to schedule a mutually convenient time for 
you to visit Houston and meet with his group.   The dates that have been 
suggested are:   Wednesday, 10/25/2000; Thursday, 10/26/2000; or Friday, 
10/27/2000.    I hope that one of these dates will be convenient for you to 
come in for interviews.

You may either respond to me by email, or phone me at 713 853-4804, whichever 
is easier for you.   I am also leaving a voicemail message for you at your 
home phone number.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Krishna,

I have received two additional  requests for help from EES.

1. Jeremy Blachman called and asked us to increase very significantly the 
level of
our support of EES. It probably makes sense to set up a meeting with Jeremy 
ASAP
and discuss specifics (you, me, and it probably makes sense to invite Marty 
Sunde
as well).

2. George Posey called and asked fro help with statistical sampling of  Dublin
customers. Please, give him a call to set up a meeting.

I shall call you tomorrow to discuss both requests.

Vince

Fiona,
?
Please find attached a brochure for the advertisement of the  book.? It's 
similar to the other material we sent, so I'm assuming it will  need the same 
modifications.? Please pass along all the modifications as  soon as 
possible.? Receiving the changes from Enron is the?only thing  holding up the 
printing of the book.? Please let us know if there is  anything that you need 
from us.

Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Vince,

I see that you are flying around a lot this week, but I wanted to let you 
know how it's going with the newsletter.  I've scheduled Steve Bigelow as the 
"person of the week."  Regarding Technical Corner, I sent you a copy of 
Maureen's article for your review.  Bob Lee told me he has also sent you 
something.  I'd appreciate your guidance on which one to use.  I believe 
Maureen's is time-sensitive, so I'd vote for that one if you've had a chance 
to look it over.

I'm going to be out of town the rest of today and Thursday-Friday to attend 
my uncle's funeral in Illinois.  If you fly over Illinois, please wave! :-)

Have a safe trip(s),

Sam

John,

I shall see Christie tomorrow and I shall talk to her about
the project.

Friday, Feb 23 works for me.

Vince

Vince,

Just an update for you and a question.  First, I have talked to Christie
and corresponded via e-mail.  We don't have dates to talk to Lay, Skilling
and Fastow as yet but Christie is working on it.  I will prompt her again
next week.

The second item of business is a question.  I want to see if we can move
our meeting in Spring (Business education and the new economy workshop)
back a week to Friday February 23rd.  One of the attendees has a conference
he wants to attend on March 2nd.  Let me know asap if the 23rd works for
you.  I have committments from a number of folks for the workshop and I
think it will be great fun and a wonderful learning experience for us all.

"Volatility of Electricity  Prices - Measurement and Analysis of Underlying  
Causes"
Dr.  Vincent Kaminski
Managing Director and Head of Research for Enron  Corp.

?

Abstract:

The last three years were characterized  by exceptionally high volatility of 
the power prices in the US markets. The  market developments have created a 
number of unique challenges for energy  industry economists. One immediate

Although we can all agree that the  prices in the power markets are

The second challenge is to explain the  sources of high price volatility and 
to answer the question to what extent  it can be attributed to problems that 
can be addressed in the long run. Such  problems include flaws in market 
design that allow some market participants  to abuse market power, limited 
availability and/or unequal access to  transmission, temporary shortages of 
generation capacity. Some factors  underlying high volatility of electricity 
prices may be of permanent nature  and may be a necessary price to pay for 
increased market efficiency and  expanded customer choice.

Osman,

This guy is too much.
I would tell him that we understand
that he has to make the best choice
for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat 
his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed
in Enron.

We never had any luck hiring a statistician.
Maybe we shall get one some day.

I had a message on my phone this morning from WIlliam indicating that
he had changed his mind and will be taking another job. He also mentions that
the other organization will give him time to publish his  thesis and he 
assumes 
Enron would not do that.

I am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so.

Dear Vince,

I am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities 
within your group. I have worked in RAC and am currently in Financial 
Trading. I believe the Associate/Analyst program may forward you my CV, but I 
thought it good to get in touch personally. 
Please let me know if there is someone with whom I could speak about the 
group and its needs for associates. 

With best regards,
Kate 

Shirley,

Please,schedule a meeting, 30 minutes with him.

FYI. We completed the review of the LNG model.
The copy of the review is available if you want to take a look at it.

10/16/2000 01:53 PM
The review of Eric Groves' LNG Model spreadsheet has been completed.  No 
independent model was available for use in the comparison; however, the model 
appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and 
revenue elements.

If this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning 
ship usage in the future, additional variables may be needed to represent the 
variability of trip times, weather factors, etc.  A reference describing 
these possible additions was provided.

Gwyn,

I see no reason why we cannot include the article in Monday's issue.  Of 
course, Vince will need to review it as he does for everyone's material.  I'm 
forwarding a copy to him with this message.

Regarding the software, you can just initiate a security request online and 
order it.  We can put issues online the old way until they set you up with 
the new stuff.  By the way, I'm going to be gone Thursday and Friday, so when 
your new issue is ready on Friday, you should send it to Elena.  I know she 
will be here at least in the morning.

Sam, this is great, thanks for taking care of that so quickly!  I will check 
on the software needed and get back to you today.

Also, Maureen and I co-authored a paper on PPP and our Thai forecast that 
might be appropriate for the TEch Corner.  I've attached it below. Please 
advise if we can get this into the tech corner for next week.

Thanks,

Gwyn

   
	
	

Gwyn,

I was successful in my efforts to put your new product on the web site!  Have 
a look!  I know Elena may want to modify it a bit, but at least it's up 
there.  I have a couple of suggestions for your future efforts:

Get Adobe Acrobat 4.0, Full Version (not just the Reader)---this will allow 
you to publish it in final form from your desk.

Do you have access to the Y: drive?  It's a drive mapped off of O:\Research 
and all of the web pages are there.  Let me know, and if you don't, as long 
as you have rights to O:\Research, I can come down and map if for you.

Then, all you have to do is print the new edition to PDF, then save it to the 
same spot each time, and it's automatically online.

Sam

Shirley,

Please, register me for this conference.

It is with great pleasure that I invite you to Arthur Andersen's 21st Annual 
Energy Symposium.  This year's conference will be held December 7th and 8th 
at the Westin Galleria Hotel in Houston.  Arthur Andersen is offering a 
valuable program with many of the industries top executives speaking on 
industry wide applications.

 A few weeks ago some of you may have received information regarding the 
registration process.  However, due to the level of Enron's attendance, we 
have arranged to facilitate your group's registration.  If you would like to 
register or would like more information about the Symposium, please contact 
Sabrina Whaley at 853-7696 by October 31, 2000 or forward your completed 
registration form to her at EB2355.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been 
attached for your information.  The registration fee is $950 per person; 
however, in the past we have given Enron personnel interested in attending a 
50% discount.

We are excited about the upcoming Symposium and hope that you will be able to 
attend.

Sherri,

Thanks for trying. I shall recommend to UT that they should invite
Greg Whalley or Lou Pai.

I had a chance to speak with Christian LeBroc this morning with regard to 
curve building for petrochemicals.  As it turns out, Christian left RAC in 
April and joined the Petrochem Desk as a trader.  Previous efforts at 
construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or 
SWAGs.  Unfortunately, the group had a rough P&L year with at least some of 
the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof.  When asked 
about the fundamentals group, Christian indicated that they'd only been 
around about 3-4 months and are not yet well-suited to curve building.  John 
Nowlan is indeed the head of the group.   

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at 
least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to 
understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday 
during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX 
component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning point--we could 
then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors 
(e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

I need your help...  I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget 
and I am showing a significant increase from last year.  Did we have an 
increase in headcount?  I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used 
the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year 
(see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the 
following tabs:

 Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001
 Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA
 2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
 Research  2001 budget

The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in 
your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will 
bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to 
ENA and the increase in plan?  I am open all week except for Wednesday 
between 10 and 11.  Thank you.

"Volatility of Electricity  Prices - Measurement and Analysis of Underlying  
Causes"
Dr.  Vincent Kaminski
Managing Director and Head of Research for Enron  Corp.

?

Abstract:

The last three years were characterized  by exceptionally high volatility of 
the power prices in the US markets. The  market developments have created a 
number of unique challenges for energy  industry economists. One immediate 
question we have to answer is how to  measure volatility of energy prices. 
Although we can all agree that the  prices in the power markets are 
characterized by high variability, the  traditional measures used in 
financial economics (annualized standard  deviation of log price returns) may 
not fit well electricity prices.  

The second challenge is to explain the  sources of high price volatility and 
to answer the question to what extent  it can be attributed to problems that 
can be addressed in the long run. Such  problems include flaws in market 
design that allow some market participants  to abuse market power, limited 
availability and/or unequal access to  transmission, temporary shortages of 
generation capacity. Some factors  underlying high volatility of electricity 
prices may be of permanent nature  and may be a necessary price to pay for 
increased market efficiency and  expanded customer choice.

Brad,

I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.

Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I=
=20
think the system is doing:

Curve shift =3D today's price - yesterady's price

P/L due to curve shift =3D today's market value using today's price curve (=
with=20
everything esle the same as yesterday's) - yesterday's market value using=
=20
yesterday's price curve.

So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order=20
terms.
We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri=
ce=20
change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore=
tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the =
delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde=
r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?=

Margaret Carson@ENRON
10/13/2000 01:43 PM
The  CERA  executive roundtable meeting  summary  results are as  follows:
If you are interested  in  a complete  set  of  the graphs from the  
presentations  please  let me know.

ELECTRIC POWER  PART  ONE
PEAK  TRENDS
It is  noteworthy how  rapidly volatility can change geographically in the 
electric  markets.  Last  year  the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were  the 
peakiest,  but   it reversed  this year  with  the  West  being highest  at 
the peaks  and in New England --  but only   in early May 2000 were  hgih 
peaks  apparent  there.

Demand  can vary from half the peak max  to the max.  Peakers  can be on the 
margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.  We need to 
watch  gas prices  this  winter  as they can effect  winter peak power 
prices--not  just a  summer phenomenon.

Where  are  the most gas plants  now on the margin?  Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, 
NYPP, SERC, WSCC

A  DISCONNECT
There  is  a disconnect  in the on-peak forward market price for power in 
Texas now; with the  added  5 GW  Texas forward markets  do not seem to   
take this  into account yet.  (Note:  Vince Kaminski) The  Texas forward  
market  should be  very soft  next summer  unless  we return to  105 degree 
F  temperatures.    New England  is  just one year behind  Texas  in its 
overbuild.

One main  reason for the  spikes  in Calif  is   power plants  did not  get  
built in Calif   due  to  a lack of  a capacity  charge ..and  this is not a 
panacea...as Calif also  has  many  enviro/siting  hurdles  that challenge  
developers  who want to site as well.  

  .

TSUNAMI OF  MERCHANT  CAPACITY PLANNED?
CERA   sees  over  240,000  MW  of planned  capacity over  the  2000-2005 
period;  with   25,000 MW  being  completed  in  2000;  35 MW under 
construction  for   2001 and 15 000 MW under  construction for   2002--  but  
the market  only needing   13 000  to  15 000 MW  a year.   This   shall  
lead  to  many  and large deferrals and  delays, especially in  2001  and 
2002.  What  has  been the recent  history?   US  wide  over the
past  3 years  just  11 percent of the planned  capacity  was  actually 
finished  and   18 percent  of that planned  was  actually  under 
construction.  They  assume  a  24 month  construction completion  time.

FOR PROFIT  TRANSMISSION
Cera   sees  Allegheny Energy  in PJM West;  Entergy in SPP;  Southern  in 
SERC  and Alliant  in MAPP  as all for profit transcos.
TYPICAL   O&M COSTS  IN U.S.  TRANSCOS
 Why  do  O&M  costs   differ  widely  among  transcos?  Some  costs  are  3  
to 8 times higher  than the norm  at 
$5000 in O&M expense  per 5000  system  miles  in size.  Regulatory  
overhang  allows  this...this is  weather  adjusted  to remove  high  costs  
from  big  freezes  etc.

USING REAL OPTION MODEL  VS  POWER PLANT  NPV
You  want to  try to have  the base value of  an asset  going  forward  when 
you expect volatility  and include  historical  spreads  and  fuel/power  
price  swing  assumptions.

CALIFORNIA  MARKET IS BROKEN
This market  starts  to  work  only after it   gets into  a reliability 
crisis.  No incentives  to add power  plant  capacity  and
huge hurdles   against  siting   even when the market  signals the  need is  
there.  Will the  regulator's post 2000  fix  make it  worse?

PEAK POWER  DEMAND  FORECAST
As  percent  per year  change  vs   2000  Cera  sees   2001  as follows:
New Eng  / New York 6.3 /  6.2  percent
PJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percent
MAIN /  MAPP    3.0 /   -0.1
SERC /  FRCC   1.3 /  2.3  percent
SPP /  ERCOT    4.0  /  2.3
NWPP /  Rockies     -6.8  /  -0.6
AZNM /  Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0
USA  avg    up  2.6  percent   It  looks  like Calif. in in for a   touch 
summer  in 2001  as well.

NATURAL  GAS  PART   TWO
SUPPLY  SHORT
Year   2001  supply  rebound could  be  800mmcfd   to 1.0  bcfd;  Canada   in 
2001  up only  400  a  day; in the US  we  need   2  bcfd  more supply  for  
2001  demand.  alone  let alone  storage   refill.... yet  a
cold winter  now  could   add   3  to 4  bcfd  to demand  and slash  
storages.  The  fall in drilling  in 1999  and early  2000  took   3.5  bcfd 
productive  capacity out of the  supply pool.  It  will  take  till  2005  
for US production to  reach a 4.1 bcfd  gain versus  today's production.

ADDED  GAS  FOR POWER PLANTS
Right now  Cera  expects  an incremental  need for   1  bcfd  next year for 
these plants..this will  keep prices  high

MUCH MORE POWER SWING
1990 to 1992  we needed   5  bcfd  for power plant  swings;   now  we need   
10  bcfd;  offpeak use is  even up  5  bcfd vs  10 years  ago.

RESI  USE  IS UP
The  AGA  disco members   adds   750 000 new gas   homes  each year  and 
this  builds  demand  year   round.

INDUSTRIAL   NUG  DEMAND
Of  the   24  bcfd ( 8.77 Tcf) industrials  gas use  in the US;     8.6  
bcfd   (  3.1  Tcf) of this  is for  power plant  and non-mfg  use.

HOW  FAST  CAN CANADA  ADD?
Canada  can add   3.6  bcfd   by  2005   versus  now;   adding  each year 
from  2001 to 2005 as follows:  500/800/900/700/700  mcfd annually.

IS  ARCTIC  GAS  ON THE HORIZON?
Its  is  far away;   maybe   4  or  5  bcfd  by  2015..  This  means  up  to  
2.7  bcfd  to  flow  to Midwest  by 2015  and up  to  2.4  bcfd  to 
Calif./PNW   on expansions  by  2015.

Rick,

Thanks for your message. I shall talk to Greg Whalley  about his 
participation.

Hi Vince

Who should I contact for power queries now Grant has gone?  A colleague here 
in London (Didier Magne) is giving a talk on power/gas arbitrage, and the 
consequent convergence of these markets.  

Do you have any presentations on this area, or illustrative figures on the 
increase in power/gas correlation?

Many thanks,
Steve

Jeff Gray@EES

Vince:

Have you or a member of your group had a chance to look over the forwarded 
e-mail yet?  We have a meeting on Thursday with another potential client who 
plans to use his own capital.  His capital budgeting issues are similar to 
those of the client who prompted my original e-mail.

The more DSM projects that we can help the client get approved, the more DSM 
savings we can share with the client.  These DSM projects can turn a retail 
commodity contract with low profitability into a substantially more 
profitable contract for us.

Would one of your GARCH analyses provide us with a quantitative solution?  
One of your experts in differential equations might have devised something.  
We'd really like to have something quantitative if you think it's at all 
possible.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff Gray
04/09/2001 04:41 PM
Vince:

Could you spare a few moments to look over the attached three-page Power 
Point presentation?  At a minimum, we're trying to demonstrate the 
following:  In high-volatility electricity environments, for those EES 
customers who employ their own capital, their usual capital-project IRR 
hurdles may be lowered slightly in the special case of DSM projects, to allow 
for the extra value derived from reduced risk exposure stemming from reduced 
power consumption/dependence.

I'm pushing the boundaries of real-option theory (and good sense) and viewing 
a DSM project as a series of options, the values of which are additive.  
First is the option to engage in the DSM project itself; which, if we 
exercise the option immediately, can be valued intrinsically through a simple 
NPV analysis.  Second is a strip of put options to generate "negawatts," 
extending over the useful life of a DSM installation, the cumulative value of 
which is an extrinsic value associated with the DSM project.  These options 
are exercised sequentially--over the life of the DSM installation--whenever 
the customer experiences a dramatic, stochastic spike in electricity price, 
associated with a lognormal price distribution.  I'm calling the value of 
this strip a "residual time value" associated with the original DSM option.  
If we can add this residual time value to the NPV and derive a total value 
that is quantitatively higher than a simple NPV alone,  we may be able to 
help the customer get more projects approved, even at the original high IRR 
hurdle.

Alternatively, and more feasibly, we'd like to give these same customers a 
"qualitative" tool with which they can convince their finance gatekeepers to 
lower--for DSM projects--their standard capital-project IRR hurdle .  The 
attached presentation is a first attempt at this qualitative argument.

We intend to use this only as a sales and marketing tool, to allow at least 
one of our customers who has an onerously high hurdle rate to manage around 
his company's internal capital-budgeting requirements.  He has set aside a 
large sum of money for DSM projects, but will only be able to spend a small 
portion of it under his company's current capital budgeting methodology, 
which does not take into account forward commodity price volatility.

In your opinion, is there any hope in devising a quantitative justification, 
or will we have to stick with the qualitative argument as described in the 
attached presentation?  In other words, is it possible to quantify "residual 
time value" as I've defined it above? Or, even better, are you aware of a 
more practical way of conceptualizing this problem?

Thanks,

Jeff Gray

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.

Vince

Hi Vince

Good luck calling Anjam.  He never seems to answer his mobile when Sharad 
calls him to track him down.  Furthermore he's off work until Tuesday.

I've had Tani ask me what's happened to the announcement about my new 
appointment.  Any progress there?

Cheers,
Steve

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Dear Mr Kaminski

I am delighted to say that the printed conference brochure is now available 
and our logistics team will be mailing them out, along with the speaker 
guideline packs (including information on hotel discounts etc), in the next 
couple of weeks. You will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing 
campaign.

In the interim, please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference 
brochure for your perusal. (I did not want to send you the complete 12 pages 
as it would clog up your email!) The full colour version can be found on our 
website at www.icbi.uk.com/powerisk

I hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line-up of topics is possibly 
one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong 
international interest. In particular the Executive Summit Day on e-Business 
and Power Trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to 
attend either the Summit Day or one of our two intensive post conference 
workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all 
reservations be made in advance.

I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in 
attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the 
enclosed details to them. To make things easy, I have attached a booking form 
which should be faxed to +44 20 7915 5101. ICBI would be happy to offer a 10% 
discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations.

Finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact 
our logistics manager Clare Capel on +44 20 7915 5198. Of course for any 
programme related issues, please drop me an email or call me on +44 20 7915 
5194.

I look forward to seeing you in October for what promises to be excellent and 
informative week.

Hi again,

 As, I stated is a prior emails, the contact details for the RiskCalc folks 
are as follows:

1.  Marc Brammer
Director of Strategic Sales
tel:  800.523.2627, x5706
mbrammer@MoodysRMS.com

2. Neal Clark
Vice President
Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701
nclark@MoodysRMS.com

 Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their 
quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or 
not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.

 Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between 
Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London.

Ciao,
Iris

Iris/Amitava,

I may have already said this, but we've had so many e-mails and telephone 
calls flying back and forth that I wanted to make sure I at least got this 
much out to you.  Clearly, I would like you to set up the meeting with the 
RiskCalc gurus to dig deeper into their methodology (as much as they'll tell) 
and the impact of missing variables and any other idiosyncracies the model 
may have.  Also try to get a better feel for how well they think the model 
extends to other countries.  I know from a previous conversation with Lea 
Carty and reading about the model that it was calibrated off North American 
names but they suspect it might extend to other countries.  Conversely, I 
know they are working efforts within Moody's Risk Management Services to 
develop private (and probably public) firm models specific to regions.  One 
they mentioned was Australia and also within Western Europe.  Data, as 
always, was the issue.  See if the quants have any perspective on their 
success/plan in that area.

Lastly, we truly appreciate the aggressive efforts you both have made toward 
pushing off this private model initiative and I'm very confident we'll be 
able to nail a firm plan down upon receipt of either D&B and/or Experian data.

Cheers,
Scott

Hi,

 Two RiskCalc sales people made a presentation this week about their product.

 They stated that they could set up a meeting with their quants and our 
people to discuss the model input and what happens if we have less than 17 
inputs.

 
Regards,
Iris

Ooops... part II.

I just threw out 12 as a number for something we might develop... it's really 
not based on anything.  We know 17 will work for pre-packaged programs.  We 
also know there will be a great number of names with less than the full 17... 
I assume we would pursue another model (internal or external) to provide 
probably less accurate numbers but at least available for names with fewer 
inputs.  

Mike

Hi Mike,

 Thanks for your email.

 What do you mean by "buying blind  all major data associated with these 
specific DUNS numbers"?

 I am puzzled about why you would be looking at 17 vs 12 fields.  I know 
RiskCalc requires 17 inputs and seem to apply that the model does not work 
for less than 17.  Yesterday the RiskCalc sales people could not guarantte 
that their model would work for less than the required 17 data inputs.  They 
suggested that this would be a question to direct towards their quants who 
developed the model.

Regards,
Iris

Iris,

Thanks.

After our meeting we stuck around to discuss things a little further.

Specifically with respect to global counterparty names... we have DUNS 
cross-references on about 70 of active names (13k out of 18.5k).  We could 
greatly accellerate purchase of some useful data by buying blind all major 
data associated with these specific DUNS numbers.

Pro  -  Data gets in on names we know we want to review ASAP, but without 
resolution on which specific fields are most useful.  We also get to test for 
completeness of data (how many have all 17 fields... how many have only 12 of 
which fields, etc.).

Con  -  Costs could be significantly higher... buying info we don't know we 
need (converse of buying only the 17 fields doesn't seem best answer).  We 
would end up buying additional info later... overhead costs and piecemeal 
buying will increase costs.  IT development time would be greatly 
increased... multiple file formats... developing to unknown maximum size, 
etc.... redoing when more data is purchased.

Any thoughts.

Mike

that in you!  I just moved to another position this week - with Sheila

P.S.  I doubt that you know who I am, but I had worked with the program for 
two years, 
having been hired by Mike Smalling in October 1998.  When I first moved to 
Houston

find Enron the first
day I rode it,  but I didn't know who you were until I saw you at our Super

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

Hello Vince and John,

I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus.  We can 
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.  I 
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest 
shown at the Career Fair).  These tend to be fairly informal.  I was thinking 
that we could present in this order:

Vince  Gives the Enron overview presentation  (30 minutes)
John  Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes)
 Ashley  Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)

Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you 
feel comfortable with the layout and content.  I am meeting with John today 
at 1:30 - Vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that 
would be great.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 3-3589
Thanks,
Ashley
Vince, here is a copy of the current Enron overview presentation.  There are 
also speaker notes that go into great detail.  

John, here is a copy of the current technology presentation for Carnegie

are also speaker notes that go into greater detail.  --->

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Vince

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Cindy

I would like to attend the following conference:  "Monetary Policy in the New 
Economy" on October 19th in Washington DC. This is the topic of an Annual 
Conference on Monetary Policy.  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is the keynote 
speaker.   Also, former Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and many  prominent 
monetary economists will be attending and participating in the debate on U.S. 
monetary policy.   The cost of the conference is $375.  While in Washington, 
I could also arrange meetings with the IIF economist on our largest 
investment exposures.  In addition, I could interview Mark Giancola and 
possibly some other candidates from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced 
International Studies for our group.  

Regards, 

Maureen

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

"My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,
Datren W."

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,
Carol

Vicky,

Please, send me your resume.

I shall forward it to a number of employees of  Enron in London
with my strongest recommendation. I shall send you  the list
of names. The resume will make it easier for me to=20
identify good targets.

Please, make sure you will contact me if there is no reaction.
People here are very busy and, as you know, things fall through the cracks.

Vince

Dear Vince,

How are you? Well I hope.

I hope you don=01,t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months =
ago
I left Risk Publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only =
a
few months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of =
a
corporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector=
.

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am
very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it
would be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and I
am planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities,
which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing
and research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wondered
whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.

I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be
fantastic Vince.

Thanks and best regards,

Vicky Windsor

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Vince

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy

Norma,

I would like to bring him over to talk to Kevin Presto, George Hopley

I am writing a management report on weather risk management. The story
will discuss different weather risk management tools used by power
marketers in the energy industry. It also looks at weather prediction
and analysis services available to energy traders.

I am looking for a list and description of the weather risk management
products, and how each can benefit an energy trader. I would also like
to know what  traders' reactions to significant weather are. And where
can I find a list of popular weather instruments with descriptions?

I appreciate any help you can give me. I would like to set up a chat

CONFERENCE THEMES & OBJECTIVES

E-Commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry.  This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
E-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a "winner" when the shakeout
hits, full-force.

Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emerging
markets.  An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.  As competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.

Few eCommerce markets--whether e-tailing online exchanges or others---will
be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts.  This conference will
combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with the
latest thinking about the unique features of E-commerce, to identify
successful strategies for surviving a shakeout.

Questions to be addressed include:

- Are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
applicable to eCommerce?  What are the early warning signs of an impending
shakeout?

- Which eCommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout?  Will there
be single or multiple winners?

- Which companies are likely to survive?  What strategies will the winners 
use?

There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
contribute to prospects for survival.  How important are first mover
advantages and building brand equity?  What do incumbents have to do to
prevail?  Which business models are most robust?  How important is the
ability to manage strategic partnerships?

These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia and
Wall Street.

Hope you are both enjoying Paris. We've past the  end of September which was 
the deadline for the ext EPR article. Seeing as we  were going to use the 
same data set for articles 2 and 3 I've done drafts of  them both. Please

Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

Vince

Hi Vince,

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

regards

Steve

Mike,

Please check with Alison. She sent  the  form again.
I think she lost  what you sent her.

Maureen,

Any interest?

Attached is the resume of Mark Giancola.  Mark is the husband of Penny Pan, a 
UVa business school student for whom I was mentor last summer.  Penny has 
received a permanent offer and is inclined to accept if her husband can find 
suitable employment in Houston.  As you will see from his resume, Mark has 
worked as an economist in the public and private sectors for the past 2.5 
years.    Mark is interested in a role where he can use his abilities to 
analyze political, credit currency and related risks.  Please let me know if 
you have any interest.  Thanks, Rich

John:  Is there a place here in EnronCredit.com?

Penny mentioned that you might have some ideas about job opportunities
in Houston for someone with my background.  As you know, Penny was
pleased to receive an offer from Enron and I plan to earnestly look into
the Houston job market myself.

The weeks leading up to the annual IMF/World Bank meetings are one of
the busiest times of year for us, but now that they are over I have had a
chance to update my resume (attached).  I would be grateful if you
would take a look and pass it on to anyone you think might be interested.

As you will see, most of my background is policy related, and most
recently international economic policy.  However the skills I have
developed have applicability in the private sector as well.  For example, a
large part of my job at the Treasury involves sovereign risk analysis.
Two possible avenues I see for building on this knowledge are: 1)
applying my knowledge to decisions regarding allocation of global
financial assets; or 2) identifying risks facing a mutinational company and
developing strategies to reduce that risk.

I should mention that in addition to my economics training I do understand
basic finance, and I am preparing to begin the CFA.  I should also note
that the work environment here at the Treasury is quite fast paced, with
constant deadlines and a great deal of pressure placed on economists.  I
tend to work 55+ hours per week so I do not expect I would need to
adjust signifiantly if I were to move to the private sector.

I greatly appreciate your taking the time to look at my resume and giving
some thought to where I might look.  I welcome any comments and ideas
you might have.

Thanks,
Mark Giancola

p.s. the formatting on my resume seems to change whenever I e-mail it;
let me know if you prefer that I fax it to you.

It's OK for Walter to use remaining hours. No real cost to Enron,
just the benefits.

Vince

Walter Coffer contacted me regarding whether we still have power flow 
software available.  We do have almost all of a 200 execution-hour license 
for PSS/E, which was purchased for the transmission congestion project last 
summer.  This was purchased by East Power Trading.  Should Walter want to use 
the remaining hours, who has authority to grant this?

Thanks,
Martin

John,

Per our discussion, Nov 13 is fine.

Vince

Vince,

I have penciled you in for Nov 13th for my class.  Does this work for you?
This is a Monday and I would suggest you come up Monday afternoon, you can
give a brief talk to our department late in the afternoon, and then you can
talk to my Ex MBAs at 6 p.m. for an hour or so.  I'll get you to the hotel
for the evening and we can work on the paper Tuesday morning.  I recommend
this Mon noon through Tue noon arrangement since I will be out of town the
weekend before the 13th.  If this needs reshuffling let me know.  We'll
make it work.

I look forward to talking with you later this week along with Mark Palmer.

Vince:

I don't know if you noticed that we have Tim Bollerslev on the seminar
schedule for December 8.  In order for Tim to get back to North Carolina on
Friday, we need to move the seminar time.  I thought that the Enron folks
might be interested in his talk so I wanted to get you input on a new
time.  I know that 3:30 is best but would over the noon hour be second best
or would 2:00 be better?

Thanks.

There may be a business opportunity with this company, but I would not advise 
making an investment.

Mike,

Using NASA satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a Houston 
Data Center to consolidate and centrally process 3D seismic data surveys for 
oil and gas extraction, exploration and development could save the petroleum 
industry more than $300 million dollars annually through reduced operational 
expenses.  Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the 
finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon 
$15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in 
revenue.  By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using 
this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the 
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.  By 
holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a 
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team 
is quantifying the valuation of this information)

Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data 
transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, 
calculated using $22/barrel oil.

Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a 
presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron 
potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October).

Today's focus: Super-secret Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network Associates is teaming up with the National Security Agency,
the government's top electronic cryptography and spying institution,
to help the agency fine-tune its highly secure version of Linux. The
goal is to create a version of Linux that is impervious to outside
attacks.

Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, is a project under development
by the NSA to create a version of the operating system that is more
secure than the commercial distributions of Linux available from
software vendors and the open-source community. The PGP Security
division of Network Associates is working with the NSA to modify the
Linux source code so that applications running on a Linux server or
PC have reduced access to a Linux machine's underlying operating
system. The aim is to give Linux servers the ability to shirk off
"buffer overrun" and "format string" attacks, which take advantage of
loose ends in Linux applications to access a server's core operating
system and shut it down. A Linux worm dubbed "Lion" was recently
identified as using this method to hack Linux servers.

NSA has worked with other software firms to shore up other weaknesses
in the operating system. Secure Computing has worked on the SELinux
project to add its Type Enforcement technology to SELinux. Type
Enforcement protects the operating system and applications by
segmenting them into security "domains" with specifications on what
types of files can be accessed by each domain. (For example, this
could be used to prevent access to a configuration file through an
application, such as Apache Web server). NSA is also working with
VMWare to come up with a more secure user permissions system for
allowing users with different security access to work on the same
server.

The good news for Linux users who are not high-level NSA operatives
is that SELinux will be released to the open-source community once
finished. This means that commercial Linux vendors could include
SELinux security enhancements in future releases, resulting in more
bulletproof Linux Web and database servers in enterprises.

John,

Congratulations on a career move.

Yes, we were contacted regarding geophysical data gathering/transmission 
project.
We asked our geophysicists for help and are shooting for
a meeting on  Thursday to run our ideas by them.

Vince

Good Morning Vince:

1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  

I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
Have they contacted you yet?

2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
for you or your team to help out.

opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles

Pierre-Philippe,

Yes, we are ready. I shall be accompanied by one person from
our Analyst/Associate program and I would like to ask you if she can be 
invited
to dinner as well.

We plan to come Thursday night and leave on Sat morning to avoid potential
flight delay risk.

Hi Mr. Kaminski,

Just touching base  for the 3rd of November. Is everything ready?

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

Mark,

Two points. 

1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power 
Play", is on a
tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a 
meeting last Sunday 
at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to
the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 
people attended.

2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to 
write jointly an
academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an 
article on EBS.
I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company 
Reinventing Itself.

I made a few points to John:

a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching
strategy developed by the management.

b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up 
with a term
"proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."

c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality
of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
empowerment.

d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and 
accomplishemnts.

The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate 
strategy
and would help greatly our recruiting efforts. 

Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key 
players. 
Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.

Shijie,

Additional   changes.

Abstract:

The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to 
fully deregulated markets in
generation and transmission.

The title is fine.

Please make changes as you feel necessary and send them back to me.  I'll
send them out to the organizers once I get your confirmation on this.

Best,

3:30pm tomorrow the 9th will be fine.  We will have to change the schedule 
a little bit, but I believe it will work.

Kevin Kindall   3:30 PM
Grant Masson   4:00 PM
Tanya Tamarchenko  4:30 PM

Same scenario - upon arrival in the lobby go to the security desk and ask
for me.  I will meet you in the lobby of the 19th floor.

Thanks so much for your flexibility!

And I am sure it is not an easy task to fit the schedule of several people to
be available at the same time window.  So please feel free to let me know if
you will need to do another time adjustment.

Valeria:

Please do not think we are always this unorganized, but things just seem
to be happening right now and it is disrupting everyone's schedule.

Would you possibly be able to come tomorrow the 8th?  Kevin Kindall
will not be here on the 15th and he would definately like to interview you.
Then Vince Kaminski will be gone for two weeks after the 15th.  It seems
like tomorrow might be the best time for everyone, if it is for you.

We can begin the interviews at 3:00 PM and probably end them at 5:00
or 5:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks so much for your understanding.

It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers
on
the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the
interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with
them on the 14th.

I will be looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Valeria:

Would you be able to do the interview on the 14th or 15th instead of the
13th?  Vince Kaminski, who would really like to interview you, has been
called out of town on the 13th.  He will be back on the 14th.

Also Grant Masson is conducting an Options Seminar on the 13th and
would not be able to interview you until after 5:00 PM.

Please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
frame only on the 14th or 15th.

Thanks!

Vince,

I have received the full-time offer package from Associate & Analyst Program
last week. Apparently they have pretty tight deadlines. Because of a certain
clause in the contract, I may have to give them an answer by October 16th.
Since we discussed this before I left Enron, I felt it would be a good idea
to inform you of the recent developments.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon regarding both part-time and
full-time employment opportunities with the Research Group.

Please, read.

Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON
TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

Thanks for your message. I am in process of

Unless there a major change in my schedule, I shall arrive
in London on Monday morning (September 18) and  leave on
Thursday in the evening.

Please, let me know what would be convenient time
to meet. You can send me an E-mail message and my secretary
will contact to confirm the date and place of the meeting.

number is 713 853 5290.

I look forward to meeting you, Tom and Julian.

that you have met Tom and Julian before.   I would also like to attend - I am 
a
manager in our UK Financial Services practice with responsibilty for Enron 
from
a UK financial services perspective.  We would like to discuss any risk
management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which 
we
could assist.

If you are happy to meet on this basis, I would be grateful if you could let 
me
know how you to proceed (whether I should arrange timings with you, your
secretary, someone in London etc).  You can contact me on +44 20 7783 7446 (at
Enron's London offices) or on this e-mail address.

Kind Regards

Vince,
Have you seen the latest version of our article?  In a nutshell, it
establishes both what's right and what's wrong with r-squared/regression.
Essentially, r-squared is fine PROVIDED that the amount of the derivative
optimal, but otherwise it makes little sense.
Please let me know what you think about this.

Please respond to Darrell Duffie <duffie@Stanford.EDU>
Taiichi:

Here is the cover letter and report
that I sent to Vince Kaminsky on June 26.
As Zimin was the source of the
model and code, I think Vince
may not mind if you forward
it directly to Zimin.
Please wait 24 hours before
doing so in order to give
Vince a chance to countermand that.

Thanks!

Darrell

Date: Mon, 26 Jun 2000 10:04:37 -0700 (PDT)
Vince:

I attach a report, prepared under my direction
by my research assistant, Dr. Taiichi Hoshino,
now employed with Goldman Sachs, on the Enron storage
valuation model that you asked me to review.

This report contains some details that
you didn't ask for, but that your research staff
might appreciate.

The model and software are appropriate to
the task they are designed for, in my opinion, based
on the code and the documentation that
you sent. Some suggestions for
potential improvement are noted
in the attached report, but these
are either minor or not critical
to the current business objectives of the model,
in my view.

If this email is not sufficient, or you
would prefer a hard-copy opinion letter,
please let me know.

Meanwhile, I hope life at Enron is
as exciting as usual!

Sincere regards,

Darrell

PS I will bill you separately for my time (1.5 hours)
and the time of Dr. Hoshino.

Ms. Geman,

I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.

I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
left off?

I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
on this issue.  

I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within 
the next 2 weeks if possible.

Thank you,

Karla Feldman

Please find attached the final copy for chapter 3.

We have about a week before we begin printing, so if you do  see?something 
that needs changed, please let us know as soon as you  can.??

I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH. I am forwarding to 
you the resume 
of one of the students  of the University of Houston.

She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was 
most
impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude. I used
to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am
still helping their local chapter.

As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.

Hi Vince,

I am on the technical program committee of the Infocom 2001 conference,
and we are meeting in New York City on Saturday, October 14th, to select
papers for the conference program. I'm leaving Stanford on Friday and
getting back on Sunday.

It might be a possibility to have dinner together on Sunday, if that would
work for you. In that case I would have to reschedule my flight to land
in SFO earlier than I'm currently scheduled to land.

Would dinner on Sunday work for you? Any chance we can meet Monday for
lunch?

I look forward to seeing you.

Best Regards,

Nick

dear Vince,
Our Workshop has already 20 registered delegates,
which is very good given the French power situation.
Moreover,French people tend to be fairly educated
and we should coordinate a little bit.
I am leaving in 30 minutes for 2 days.Can we talk on Sunday
at 7 or 8 p.m my time?My 2 numbers will be
33 1 46040110 or 33 6 08074200
Alex would agree to speak for a while as we did in Francfort.
Karla sent me a proposal for the Escrow problem.I had a
further question in your direction regarding "system support".
Karla,as you know,would kindly like to wrap up the contract
before moving to a new Department and I will  do my very
best to satisfy her wish and your feasible requests.
Kind regards

Great Vince!

Thanks for replying.  This idea is really snowballing and we're getting a lot 
of support - I can't wait to talk to you about it.  Are you available somtime 
early in the morning on Friday?  Maybe around 8:00 or 8:30?

I'm attaching a one-page executive summary for you to look at if you get a 
chance.

Looking forward to your reply,

Hi Vince!

Maybe you remember me, my name is Andrew Miles and we worked together on a 
speech for Jeff Skilling this past July.  I am hoping that I can get on your 
calendar for 30 minutes next week.  I have been working with 3 other Enron 
employees for the past 6 months, developing a comprehensive innovation 
acceleration process for use by potentially all Enron employees - and we 
would really appreciate your input.  We have presented the idea to quite a 
few people in the company, and some outside of the company (Strategos 
Institute), all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input.  
Many people have suggested that we run the idea by you.

If you have some time next week, would you mind allowing me to explain our 
ideas to you?  I will follow up with a telephone call.

All the best,

Andrew

John,

I shall be in Paris and London next week. We can schedule a call sometimes 
next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call 
(Paris time)
would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call
sometimes around 3 - 4 p.m. our time.

Please, indicate which day works best for you.

Vince

Vince,

Good morning.  Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson
about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early
next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time
last week I was "unprepared" and embarassed to call and expose my
ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have
a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron
speakers use is the "de-regulation" of markets.  This certainly played a
factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.

If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some
notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so
anytime after that is great.

Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip.

John

p.s.  I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowed
chair for a financial economist open.  If you ever decide to move back to
the life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a
post.

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR "value index" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

FYI

Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON
TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

Roman,

I shall be traveling next week (Europe again), Mon thru Fri.
It's Power 2000 conference in Paris.

I have many trips to different places later during October
(Berkeley, Philadelphia, etc.). These are shorter, 1-2
day trips. Please, let me know when you come to Houston.
I shall keep you posted about my itinerary as 
it becomes more certain.

Andy,

Sounds good. One comment: Vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects. 

Bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group: this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important.

We appreciate your hands-on involvement. It's always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent 
interaction
with the customer. Look fwd to working on this project.

Vince

Guys,

Here is what I took away from our meeting:

1). Research will continue working on custom reporting off of EnronOnline 
data.

2). Research will continue working on market analysis off of EnronOnline data

3). Research will a contribute a resource to the Trading Algorithm effort, 
presumably one at this point in time. I would prefer it to be Vasant but I am 
flexible.The Trading Algorithm group will be run by the EnronOnline team with 
its product reviewed by Research. It is my belief that projects like this 
require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the 
right track.

If this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can 
discuss.

Thanks,
Andy

Anita,

you and your group on 10/18 at 2:00pm.  Eugene is the Financial Products
Program Manager and Rick is a financial engineer and author of several of
toolboxes.

We want to understand the needs of your group to better demonstrate the
proper tools.  Do you or members of your group have specific applications
that we can address?  Please email me those items and I will coordinate the
presentation with our group.

We would like to demonstrate how our tools can be used to rapidly develop
applications, be integrated with databases and other applications ( OLF,
ODBC databases, Excel, VB, etc.) and then deploy those applications at no
cost to your traders and analysts.

I look forward to meeting you, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Becky,

I am sending you two spreadsheets. Headcount gives  the allocations by major
business units. Please, see the sheet Allocations. Line 83 gives you the 
percentages
you can use.

Budget  spreadsheet gives the budget projections. The sheet Allocations has 
been modified to 
include charges to RAC and GRM. I had to modify extensively  the sheet Detail
to account for the size of the group (as compared with 25 rows available to 
list the
employees in the original spreadsheet). Please, check the logic of my 
modifications
(I hope I copied all the formulas correctly). I had to assume a bonus number.

I shall work on allocations by different business units within ENA
and GRM  but it's chasing a moving target. It changes from month to month. 

I shall be gone for the next 4 business days. Please, call me and leave a 
message
on my voice mail if there is any question. I shall be listening to my voice 
messages.

Sorry if there are any problems. I have to rush to catch my plane.

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Steve,

I shall talk to John Sherriff about such issues. My intention
is to vest you with maximum decision making powers. It makes most sense to
me to make decisions where the information resides.

Please, invite Anjam or alternatively make reservations for dinner and
let Shirley know. Shirley can send an invitation to everybody  in the group
on my behalf. It would be really bad to exclude Anjam from the dinner.

Thanks Vince.

Dinner on Sunday OK all round.  Do you want Anjam along too? I can't really 
ask him, given our current relationship.

One other thing, have you had thoughts on reporting lines, who signs 
expenses, etc. etc., or are these issues to be resolved when you come over?

Cheers,
Steve

Vince --

Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San 
Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market 
discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows 
the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.

Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their 
B-school in the evenings.

Thanks.

Jim Steffes

Maureen -- please send Vince my California testimony and the talking point 
presentation for Jeff Skilling at the National Press Club.
Eliz-- keep Vince on the distribution list for the documents we are 
generating now to repond to the California situation.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor

Dear Vince
?
I would like to invite you to Chair the stream on  Energy and Corporate risk 
management at the GARP Convention. Is this something  that would be of 
interest to you?
?
Also, can I please confirm, because I am having a  few IT problems at 
present, that the following title is correct for  you:
 

Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research, Enron  Corp.
I look forward to your response in due course.
?
Kind regards
?

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

 It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF
Speaker Series list for November 3rd, I will make reservation for 8 persons
at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening. Also, if you want I can book
an hotel for you.

Let me know if you have anything in mind  for the topic of the presentation.
There is no real guidelines as we like our speakers to have as much room as
possible. Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact. One of
our speakers divided the presentation in two, the first part was technical,
the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when
hiring new employees.

Thank you very much for accepting our invitation.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie

Vince

VKaminski@aol.com on 09/10/2000 11:25:53 AM
Pierre-Philippe,

Thanks for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation in early
November. I understand the presentation are on Fridays and November the 3rd
would be the best date for me.

If you prefer November the 10th, we have to wait a few more days with the
decision. We have a management conference every year in San Antonio and it
will be held either in the 2nd or the 3rd week of November. I shall know in a
few days. The same goes for November 9, assuming it was not a mistake (it's
Thursday).

I shall be free for dinner on the day of the conference. Thanks for the
invitation.

have had the good fortune of attracting outstanding students into our

Toni,

We shall be meeting Rabi for lunch to discuss the offer and the details of his
job with him. Let's wait  for the outcome of this discussion.

Vince

   

FYI,  I do not send out a written offer package until the verbal offer issues 
are resolved and a final offer is made.   So, I'd like to put the details 
below in writing and send out to him  for Tuesday delivery.     I'm playing 
phone tag with him regarding the other details and will follow up with him 
again in the morning. 

Thanks
Toni 

   
	
	

Toni:

We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.

Regards,
Grant.

"class":

Thursday, Sept. 28, 2000
5:00 - 7:00 pm
Houston Center Club
(downtown-across from the 4 Seasons)

This is being held in conjuction with the Crude Oil Association.  They charge
$25 at the door.

However, as a host I can have as many of my colleagues there for FREE!

But,  I must know if you are coming by September 24, 2000 c.o.b., to give a
count to the Houston Center Club.

I hope you can all attend.  Please feel free to invite someone to come with
you. The simulated trading will be held three times during the evening, and
is very interesting.

I look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you on 9/28!

Jana

John,

I shall be traveling Thu and Fri this week and Mon and Tue next week. 
Please, give me a call Tuesday morning and I shall  carve out 
an hour from my schedule to discuss the paper. Stinson will be gone for three 
weeks so
we have to do the work without him.

Alternatively, we can delay the conversation till next week.

Vince

Vince,

Sorry I haven't been pressing you on the paper but there's always more to
do than we have time for.  However, I had a phone call from the editor
encouraging me to get the paper to him by Christmas so it could serve as
the centerpiece of his energy issue.  His comment to me was "everyone wants
to know what Enron's doing".  So, with that said I'll try to put together a
list of materials that I have collected and maybe we can have a phone
conversation to get your ideas on a plan to put the paper together.  The
Harvard cases do a nice job of laying out institutional and historical
details but we will need a "tack" or theme to begin the writing process.

By the way, we have managed to delay the Spring Texas Finance Festival one
week so that it will not coincide with Easter (hope you can now attend).
We didn't have too many problems with the Easter weekend but there were
some and we would prefer not to use that weekend either.

Hope all is going well for you guys.  Tell Stinson hello for me.

Your friend,

John

management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which 
we

If we face a delay with Maureen's article, I also have Giuseppe's solution to 
the probability problem that you asked him to write.  It is a page and a half 
and will do in a pinch.  See below.

Sam

Hi Will,

Vince asked me to write the solution to the little problem of two weeks ago.
Here it is, for the joy of the few aficionados of the newsletter.
Have a good weekend.

Giuseppe

(See attached file: technical corner2.doc)

FYI

Vince

Vince,

After looking at the article in question, I have a couple of questions:

1.  Normally I would want to split this into two parts, but the way it's 
structured (several references to the charts at the end), this does not look 
immediately practical.  We would certainly need Maureen's input on this.  
Without any further changes, I would want to publish the whole thing together.

2.  I assume that Maureen will send the changes back to you, and that you 
will send me the final version for publication.  Am I correct?

I'll do everything else and hold release until Technical Corner is ready.

Sam

Vince,   

Should I be responsible for Li Sun (for PRC)  or do you want Grant since she 
is primarily working for Kevin Kindall?

Maureen,

We are currently in the RAC process for Dragon, and I understand RAC has 
requested updated curves.  We are currently using the following country 
curves you provided previously:

1)  Philippines:  90700

2)  Thailand:  51500

3)  Korea:  62300

4)  China:  50900

5)  Taiwan:  20800

6)  US:   81700

I agree in principal with the methodology and understand the approach, given 
the info you have.  However, you have just provided a new curve for Thailand, 
which, was just provided to us in May.  Given the methodolgy you explained 
earlier, I find it hard to believe we would see such a huge impact (35% 
decrease on a 25 year PV basis) on our COCO valuation (Thai project).  

It appears that this Thai curve is not using PPP, and I'm not saying your 
analysis has to be PPP, but most would expect that given the varying economic 
environments and market places we deal with, PPP is a widely accepted 
practice/method, as we cannot predict the future.  Please provide us a 
detailed reconcilation among the two curves and the Country rational in 
coming up with the revised curves from 4 months ago.

Please contact me if you have any questions at 011-852-2588-1234.

Regards,

Ramon

It's been a while since I put this together. Some assumptions, such as those 
about the current VAR methodology may not be correct. But my ideas and the 
math involved are hopefully reasonable. Let me know if you have any questions.

Herb on TheStreet: Taking a Closer Look at the Honey Well

By Herb Greenberg
Senior Columnist
9/11/00 6:30 AM ET

An item in one of last week's Hotlines questioned whether a key "tell"
toward a possible preannouncement from Honeywell (HON:NYSE) was an
earnings warning from Invensys, a British controls and automation
company. Invensys is a Honeywell competitor, and Honeywell fans had
been looking at the company's controls group for signs of strength this
quarter. Got a bunch of angry email, in response, telling me I must be
a kook (or actually, something much worse ) because just a few weeks
ago Honeywell said it was comfortable with earnings estimates of 76
cents per share, which would be a pleasant 10% gain.

True, but this is, after all, the same Honeywell that in June gave
expectations of one thing for second-quarter revenues, only to amend
that a few weeks later with a lower number. And this is, after all, the
same Honeywell that several quarters ago said it would take no more big
charges, and then turned around and took a whole bunch of new charges.

Will the same thing happen this time round? Hard to say, and as of
Friday all a Honeywell spokesman would say to me was: "We're sticking
with our guidance." On earnings, that is. Interestingly (and subtly)
Honeywell didn't say anything about revenues in its recent update, and
the spokesman said there will be no revenue guidance now, either. Stung
once, too smart to be stung twice, I guess.

But that also highlights that Honeywell has entered the quarter with
negative revenue momentum, which is not what Wall Street wants to see.
Earnings can meet estimates lots of different ways (an item here back
in March showed how half of Honeywell's 20% earnings gain came from
pension income) but revenue represents business in the raw.

So, why worry now? According to one longtime Honeywell watcher, who
prefers to go incognito (so he can protect his relationship with the
company, in which he still holds a small stake), events that could
further effect this quarter's earnings and revenues include the sharp
rise in oil prices -- the same rise in oil prices that last week helped
clobber DuPont (DD:NYSE), which warned of lower earnings (thanks, in
part, to oil). Honeywell also disclosed that problems with brakes it
makes for buses will shave 2 cents per share off earnings. The warning
came after the earnings reassurance a couple of weeks ago, but was
included in the recent forecast. It's unclear, however, how the
problems will affect brake sales (and therefore revenues), going
forward. Oh, and Honeywell is laying off 5% of its workforce. (A
supposed growth company firing people?!) Then there are more charges,
lots of charges -- but the 76 cent per share number excludes them.

What's more, analysts are just starting to take a close look at the
company now that they're back from summer vacation. At least one
analyst who has tried to get some sign of how things are going was told
the company hasn't seen the August numbers yet, which means there still
could be reasons for concern.

All of that said, Honeywell has been doing loads to improve itself, but
our longtime Honeywell watcher, who is looking for the right time to
hop back in, doesn't think there'll be signs of a solid rebound until
next summer. At the earliest.

Short Positions

 o From reader John Lee: "How's this for an inflation indicator? Down
here in our cafeteria today we were confronted by a sign that indicated
the cafeteria was raising prices "to cover rising food and labor
costs..." But inflation is nearly nonexistent, right? Right (he said,
sarcastically). Wouldn't be surprised to see a few fast-food chains
that missed earnings last quarter, because of rising costs, bite the
bullet and raise prices, too. (A dime or a quarter isn't going to drive
customers away; but a dime here at one place and a quarter there at
another would certainly lead to higher prices across the board. Or so
you'd think!)

 o Stupid poll?!: That's what some folks thought of Friday's poll which
asked whether you should pay more attention to a company, friendly
analysts or unfriendly analysts. (Unfriendly won by a landslide.)
Several readers, however, wish I'd had a fourth alternative: All of the
above. Says reader Bridget Magnus: "I think that if a person is going
to make a realistic, informed decision about a company it is a good
idea to listen to all three of those sources (the company, friendly
analysts, and unfriendly analysts). Putting them together will give a
potential investor a much clearer picture of what is (or isn't) going
on." Great point! Which brings us to today's poll:

Feel free to send emails to my sidekick Mark Martinez with any reason
why you think the way you do. Cramer has pretty strong opinions about
this. And speaking of JJC, don't forget that he and I will be going
head-to-head at RealMoney.com's "Cramer Live" conference in San
Francisco later this month. Click here for more info.

 o Bye, George: Marketing columnist George Lazarus of The Chicago
Tribune died Friday while commuting on the train to work. He was 68 and
he still wrote a daily column. He was a former colleague and I'd like
to think, a friend, whom I didn't keep in touch with nearly enough.
George wrote the textbook on how to be a hard-working, daily,
news-oriented columnist. You could see just how hard he worked when he
walked through the office at the end of every day, looking exhausted,
as he handed the finished copy into his editor. His salutation to me,
when he saw me was always, "Hey, scoop." Coming from the scoop, that
was an honor. Hey, George. -30-

Darren,

Glad to hear from you !   I heard that you moved to Japan, hope everything 
goes well for you.

The catastraphe option was listed in Chicago broad of trade, but the open 
interest was very small. 
Internally, Enron insurance group knows a few insurance companies offer such 
product. The contact
person is Jim Bouillion.

If you are interested to offer such bond/insurance in Japan,  we can look 
into the pricing and "hedging" (i.e. reinsurance)
issues.  I will discuss this with Vince, Stinson and Vasant. 

Best Regards,

Zimin

Hello Zimin. I hope all is well with you.

 As you may have heard,I moved to Enron Japan about 2 weeks ago in order to 
foster a financial trading presence here, with the intention of utlizing this 
location to better optimize the management of Gary's exisitng portoflios, as 
well as to identify and act on local trading or financial opportunities.

One peripheral, recurring idea has been for Enron to somehow establish a 
market in catastraphe bonds and/or insurance. Earthquakes are perhaps the 
greatest risk that the Japanese people fear according to various polls, a 
natural response to the significant number of earthquakes that occur in the 
area . Such a product  would have tremendous and widespread appeal and from a 
cursary review,  it does not appear that there is a developed,liquid market 
for such products.

I was wondering if you could talk to Vince briefly about his thoughts 
regarding the feasibility of such a product, in terms of hedging where a  
 natural offset is not found. Is this a product that research feels a hedge 
can be made against with a reasonable amount of statisitcal confidence? I 
realise this is vague and if you need any more information, please contact 
me.  

Sincerely,

Darren

Vince,
Have you seen the latest version of our article?  In a nutshell, it
establishes both what's right and what's wrong with r-squared/regression.
Essentially, r-squared is fine PROVIDED that the amount of the derivative
optimal, but otherwise it makes little sense.
Please let me know what you think about this.

exchange curves and predict inflation.   Primarily, we depend on the work of 
the Institute of International Finance (IIF), we also talk with their staff 
Senior Ph.D. Economists.  We review the current macroeconomic policy mix 
including monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies and their 
sustainability.   We also analyze the balance of payments to make sure their 
are no pressures on the current account, capital account  or foreign exchange 
reserves.   In addition, we look at economic output in light of all the above 
mentioned factors and incorporate our global outlook of global growth and 
international commodity prices.  Then we determine our expectations for 
changes to these conditions based on many domestic and international 
factors.  We also evaluate the progress of  IMF program and the countries 
ability and willingness to meet the IMF criteria, and whether or not they are 
in compliance with the Fund.    In addition, we analyze the political 
risk/stability of the country, timing of elections and or major 
constitutional or policy changes which would have a major impact on the 
economy.  We also perform a ratio analysis of a country's ability to repay 
its debt in the context of debt-to-GDP ratios, debt service, import coverage, 
FDI-to-current account, etc.   We analyze the stability of the country's 
banking system, level non-performing loans-to-total, bankruptcy laws, and 
progress on restructuring bad debts.   All these factors influence the 
outlook on local price changes and movement of the exchange rate.

How often do the curves get updated? - Curves are updated upon request from 
the Enron business units or RAC.  The business units need to have the curves 
updated before Risk Assessment and Control evaluates the projects.

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

I shall join your meeting in progress.

Confirming a meeting to discuss the appropriate valuation assumptions for 
Clean Fuels.  Let's meet in Dwight Larson's office (EB 4912) at 9:30 AM..

Kerry, I suspect this is the first time that you have heard about this 
meeting, but I think you could add value to the discussion.  Hope you can 
make it.  Feel free to call either Dwight or me for any further clarification 
you might need.

Thanks, JNG

That would be great.
Please, do.

Vince, 

In case you have little time for it, I could write the answer for the 
technical corner for Monday. I have an intuitive explanation based on 
probability trees.

My wishes of a good weekend,

Giuseppe

Vince,

Good morning.

As you may know, last Thur. Enron honored this year's recipients of the
Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars at a dinner in Austin.  In addition to
the three recipients, Business School Dean May and several of my
colleagues, Enron attendees included Sally Beck, Cindy Justice, Karen
Marshall (newly-appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives for
Enron Community Relations Dept.) and Rick Causey.

I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss two
current Enron/UT issues with Rick:
I.  Spring 2001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. Skilling
II.  UT Participation in EnronTraining Activities
Per my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussion
with an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.

I.  With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:

1.  We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)
are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2001 (late Feb.
or early March) to discuss four topics:  Risk management, Deregulation,
Real options, and International/globalization.
2.  The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.
evening, then continue all day Fri.
3.  I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,
structure, participation and content.
4.  Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,
in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling to
be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.

II.  With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UT
partcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.
analysts and associates.  Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning a
specific set of issues -- "Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets"
-- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well as
customized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize for
presentation at Enron.  FYI, I am enclosing a copy of said topics at the
end of this e-mail.

I look forward to seeing you again soon, and to your UT visit on 10/11.  Best,
Ehud

Dear Mr.Kaminski,

I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other

would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
this mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Vince,

      The following message is from co-PI, Prof. Baichun Xiao in Long Island 
University. 
In this message, he told me how Enron would be registered. To my best 
knowledge,
IBM, Lucent and other big companies have registered in NSF for long. 
Your kindly understanding is acknowledged very much. 

     Good weekend,

Youyi
Baichun Xiao <bxiao@liu.edu> on 09/07/2000 09:39:38 AM
Dear Youyi:

The person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration.

FastLane User Support: 1-800-673-6188.
FastLane Availability (Recording): 1-800-437-7408.

After enron is registered (I think it's a free registration), you provide
the following information to the enron official so he/she will send it to nsf.
NSF will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
(called fastlane). Since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after Oct. 1, 2000, this is the must.

Name
Highest Degree
Year Conferred
Present Institution
Department
Street Address
City

Zip Code
Social Security Number (SSN)

Attached file consists of a list of Commercial teams within ENA.  According 
to your allocation, 39.61% goes to ENA.  12.5% of the 39.61% goes to Global 
Risk Management and the rest, which is 27.11% needs to allocate to the rest 
of ENA Commercial Teams.  Will you look at the attached file and let me know 
who I should allocate the 27.11% to?  If you have any questions, call me.  
Thanx.

Thanx for visiting my web site!

Let me know if there is any progress on your front.

Also, I know we talked about several dates around early november, up to now
it seems like the 9th would be a candidate... If you could choose one (a
friday if you can) I would make all the necessary arrangement. A lot of
people here are very anxious to meet you... your reputation precedes you! If
you could be free for a diner on the evening preceeding the presentations,
or on the day of the presentation I could set up a time table.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Pierre Ste-Marie tells me he has invited you to visit Carnegie Mellon.  I
would just like to emphasize how much we hope you can arrange a visit.  We
have had the good fortune of attracting outstanding students into our
Master's program in Computational Finance, and I think you will enjoy
meeting them.  Last year Alexander Eydeland visited, and at the conclusion
of the year hired one of the students.  I look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely yours,

I shall call you on Monday about it.

Dwight and I are working to develop an updated valuation for the MTBE and 
methanol business segments.  We would appreciate assistance from your group 
in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.  

With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price 
environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.  How will 
political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.  

Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North 
American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain 
higher than the rest of the world.

Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most 
helpful.  Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of 
your group as soon as convenient.

Thanks, sorry we missed you today.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for meeting with me again today over lunch. I appreciated 
the opportunity to catch up with you.

Please find attached my current resume (both a short and a long version). I 
have worked as a trader, portfolio risk manager, and a stock analyst. I have 
traded derivatives, bonds, and stocks,  and managed insurance and pension 
investment portfolios to maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Let me highlight 
some of my work experiences.

Trading and Risk Management
    a.. Structured, negotiated, and traded OTC interests rate swaps, 
cross-currency swaps, swaptions, and exchange-traded equity index futures and 
options. Made PowerPoint presentations to GARP and the UOH on credit 
derivatives.
    b.. Developed investment hedging program utilizing exchanged-traded bond 
futures and interest rate swaps.
    c.. Traded and managed pension and insurance fixed income portfolios to 
maximize total return and funding ratios. Bonds traded: Treasuries, Agencies, 
MBS/CMOs, ABS, Corporate, Yankees, and Foreign.
    d.. Traded and managed stock mutual portfolios for total return.
    e.. Created a computer program to quantify the attribution of total 
return for fixed income portfolios relative to market returns.
    f.. Programmed investment compliance rules to monitor the management of 
domestic and global stock, bond and money market mutual funds.
    g.. Supervised market risks, credit risks, legal risks, and operations 
risks of derivatives, bonds, money market securities, and equities.
Policy , Reporting and Projects
    a.. Developed investment policy guidelines to manage fixed income 
portfolios.
    b.. Rewrote derivatives policy manual.
    c.. Prepared a 20-page PowerPoint slide presentation on India for the 
senior management.
    d.. Prepared and presented investment reports to CIOs, Investment 
Committees, and Boards of Trustees
I shall, therefore, appreciate your help in connecting me with the right 
individual within Enron for a job interview to work as a financial 
trader/risk manager. I can provide excellent references upon request.

Thank you for the lunch.

Sincerely,

        Dear Mr. Kaminski:

        How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick
    lunch.

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

> The following press release was issued today:
>
> PJM EXECUTIVE DESCRIBES SUCCESS
> OF POWER GRID IN MID-ATLANTIC REGION
>
> (HARRISBURG, Pa. Aug. 31, 2000) - Phillip Harris, Chairman and CEO of PJM
> Interconnection, LLC, North America's largest centrally-dispatched 
electrical
> system, testified before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission this 
week
> on the reliability and affordability of electricity in the state.
>
> PJM, which became the first fully operational Independent System Operator in
> the U.S. on January 1, 1998 is responsible for the reliability of the bulk
> power transmission system and to facilitate an open, competitive wholesale
> electric market.
>
> PJM is responsible for coordinating the transmission of more than 58,000
> Megawatts of electricity over 8,000 miles of power lines it uses to get 
power
> from 540 generating stations to more than 24 million customers.
>
> The Interconnection serves 8 percent of the country's population, which is
> spread throughout the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and
> northern Virginia region. PJM is the third largest entity of its kind in the
> world, behind Tokyo Electric and France's grid-the whole country.
>
> PJM's duties also entail administration of the energy market, which now 
takes
> place over the Internet. The commodities-like exchange is facilitated by 
PJM's

> enabled PJM to manage more than $4 billion in the energy market in the past
> three years, achieve a 96 percent customer approval rating and has secured 
the

>  In his testimony, Harris outlined the underlying principles of why PJM has

> -more-

>
> Transition Process
>
> Moving from a government regulated entity to a deregulated market model is a
> complicated process. PJM took an incremental and methodical approach to
> deregulation by taking measured steps and evaluating the results of the
> transition after each step to ensure reliability of the existing services.
> What is now a five-market system, began with a single market and was phased 
in
> over two years.
>
> Governance Model
>
> To ensure fairness in the market, PJM chartered a two-tier governance model
> that includes a fully independent board that is supported by advice from a
> Members Committee.
> The model provides a forum for member debate and a process to develop
> collaborative solutions. PJM's more than 200 members as well as stakeholders
> can have a voice and confidence that change to business rules will occur
> fairly, collaboratively, and efficiently.
>
> Power Exchange Function
> The success of the PJM Power Pool and the continued combination of the
> reliability and market functions within the new PJM ISO were the most
> efficient and cost effective transition to the future.
>
> The connection of both functions within one organization, that is 
financially
> independent of both transmission and generation facilities, system
> modifications and market innovations required to assure reliability can move
> forward quickly and efficiently, without artificial barriers to
> implementation.
>
> Long-Term Reliability
>
> The reliability of the grid and the market is dependent upon the free flow 
of
> information to PJM members and stakeholders.
> Using tools like the eData application, PJM members can view Real Time 
Energy
> Market prices on public Internet pages every five minutes for approximately
> 2,000 hubs, zones, and significant locations throughout the PJM region. The
> information-rich environment has initially drawn the interest of 30,000
> additional Megawatts of capacity to join the PJM region, which translates 
into
> greater reliability.
>
> -more-
> 3/3
>
> Transmission Expansion Process
>
> PJM is increasing the services it provides to the growing economy and the
> population. Competition, growth and reliability of the market and grid is
> further aided by a well-planned, FERC-approved expansion process that
> anticipates an additional 15,000 Megawatts added to the PJM region over the
> next five years.
> An additional 20,000 Megawatts are planned to be added in the future, 
ensuring
> an abundant pool of power to meet increasing demand.
>
> Collaborative Process
>
> The innovative two-tier governance for PJM and management of the grid and
> market includes all stakeholders, regulators and traders and provides a 
forum
> other groups to be part collective collaborative membership process.
>
> Needs of the Customer
>
> PJM is attentive to making the system responsive to the changing needs of 
the

> members with flexibility to create a portfolio of transactions to best suit
> their dynamic needs.
>
> The eSuite of tools (eFTR, eDocuments, eSchedules, eCapacity, eData) and PJM

I have tons of papers on OAS. They are buried in many boxes in my garage.
Let my try to excavate some of  them.

Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? This is Li Sun, I have a question regarding OAS 
(Option-Adjusted Spread) model, according to my reading, it is a very 
powerful and practical model for dynamic balance sheet management and it is 
exactly what we want to do for the enterprise-wide risk management. 
Unfortunately OAS is only explained in a broad sense, I wonder whether I 
could get some recommendations on where I can get more detailed information 
regarding this topic. Many thanks!

Li

Vince,

Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read 
it once before I forward it for internal approval?   I specified that the 
$100,000 covers a single  user  perpetural license,  access to source after 
one year,  and covers maintenance and support for one year.

Any suggestions?

to your allocation, 39.61% goes to ENA.  12.5% of the 39.61% goes to Global 
Risk Management and the rest, which is 27.11% needs to allocate to the rest 
of ENA Commercial Teams.  Will you look at the attached file and let me know 
who I should allocate the 27.11% to?  If you have any questions, call me.  
Thanx.

Vince,

I was wondering if you or someone in your group has had a chance to overview 
the LNG shipping model that I sent you.  Merritt Thomas is sending me more 
data to add the to model on all of the other ports and nautical miles.  I

Thanks. I shall discuss this with Steve as soon as we have the nomination

I can do it while he is stioll here at Houston.

We need to get a nomination form signed by you & Vince.  Once we have this

will get the nomination form signed by Sherriff and the agreement drawn up.  

I will get one up to you today / tomorrow.

Sophie,

Vince

Sophie Kingsley   08/30/2000 11:49 AM

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Dale Surbey
30/08/2000 16:09
Sophie,

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

- Dale

Vince J Kaminski
30/08/2000 14:21
Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Vince

Dale Surbey
08/30/2000 07:49 AM
Vince,

This is the package HR is proposing for Steven.  What do you think?  

- Dale

Sorry Dale, long day, here are the proposed numbers

2 Year Exec
o62,000 Basic  ( currently o55K )
o10K each year kickers
$50,000 worth of options to vest 1/3 1/3 1/3

Let me know what you think.

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

~~~~~~~ This newsletter sponsored by 
LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES ~~~~~~

Voted "Best in Test" and a "Good Buy" for carrier/ISP
applications, Lucent Technologies' Secure VPN Solutions
garnered top ratings by Mier Communications' recent
Independent Lab Test Report. The products, which included
Lucent's VPN Firewall Brick, Lucent Security Management

Today's Focus: Palm virus reported
Before I get into the more serious topics of the day, I thought
I'd share a funny "virus alert" that one of my friends
forwarded to me. The e-mail, entitled "Virus Alert!!!!!!"
contained the following message:

Alert

I'm too lazy to program a real virus, so this virus works
on the honor system-

Please delete all the files on your hard drive...

Now, please forward this message to everyone you know...

Thank you for your cooperation......

Okay, now on with the serious stuff.

A number of the antivirus vendors have issued alerts about the
Liberty virus that allegedly infects PalmOS machines. The
Trojan is said to come disguised as an update to a legitimate
Palm application, Gambit Studios LLC's Liberty GameBoy
emulation software.

However, when executed, the program attempts to delete all
applications on the Palm. Computer Associates, Symantec and
Trend Micro all say they're the first to release protection for
the virus.

For more information on the Palm Liberty virus, see:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0829palmvirus.html

One last thing on the PGP issue we wrote about last week before
we get to the alerts. Phil Zimmerman, the man behind PGP, has
issued a response to the problem. Some are claiming the issue
is the result of a backdoor. Zimmerman explains that this is
not the case. Read his response at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0904pgpzimm.html

Today's alerts and patches:

Allaire issues two security bulletins:

Workaround available for administrative interface security
issue

The Allaire Spectra 1.01 product comes with a utility for
configuring the Spectra applications and was accidentally
included in some commercial releases of the product. The tool
could be used by a malicious user to view sensitive data files
used for configuring and administering the Spectra system. For
a workaround:
http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=17372&Method=Full

Patch available for Spectra Container Editor preview-object
security issue

The Spectra Contain Editor runs objects with no security under
preview mode. This means an object can invoke any method
without proper permissions. For more information and to
download a patch:

Caldera warns of /tmp file race in faxrunq

According to a Caldera alert, the mgetty package contains a
number of tools for sending and receiving facsimiles. One of
the tools, faxrunq, uses a marker file in a world-writable
directory in an unsecured fashion. This bug allows malicious

Dear Vince,
1.I apologize for not having got back to Karla
earlier but Dauphine is not properly equipped yet.
2.The conference with Samuelson,Merton,Heath,
Ross,McKean etc was spectacular.512 academics
and practitioners came to College de France and
 were very grateful.
3.I was so worn out afterwards that I did not make
it to Houston.I just went to visit Alex after a week
conference on Quantitative Risk Management
where I was speaking at Carnegie Mellon
4.Another former PhD student of mine has been
testing and improving the software.He is great
and modest ;giving the papers I referee and the
conferences I go to,I do believe that we are still
ahead(or way ahead)today.We also beautifully
simplified the valuation of the hourly swings.
Obviously,in case of a problem,my reputation
and your esteem would be more valuable
than 30% of 90,000 USD (to be shared ...)
5.I declined RISK in Houston and NewYork
and am not sure I will have the pleasure
to see you in London.In all cases, we
should coordinate for Paris soon

GemanIX@aol.com on 09/01/2000 03:49:56 PM
Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please receive all my apologies for not having
answered earlier your 2 emails,but I was in the
States for 6 weeks and could not access my
Dauphine email.In any case,the time was
fruitfully used by my associates and myself to
improve the "robustness" of the product,from
a computer and mathematical standpoint.
Regarding your 3 points
1.We agree on the price of 90,000 USD
2.D-G will provide system support:we can do so
by emailing anther version of the software,being
available on the phone and by email but we
cannot promise unlimited support of all kinds
without risking bankruptcy right away.
Moreover,the $ 90,000 may be paid in 3 fractions
and your risk would be quite minimal
3.Regarding the escrow,we have been using so
far a small law firm with 5 partners(none of my
family) in Amherst:Hart,Reed,Brown,Golowich
and Kaplan.But we are not closed to anther
solution you would strongly prefer.
Best regards

Hi Vince,

I just got off the phone with donna piazze at Wharton, (I don't know if there 
is a relationship with Tom at Wharton), and we were discussing there Tiger 
Teams.  It is a required research program, 2nd semester for MBAs, and Wharton 
would love to have Enron participate.  I told her there is probably some real 
life reasearch project we could have the students do.  She did  also mention 
that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton..  I 
gave her your number.

Her number is 215 573 8394.  Please call her when you get a chance within the 
week.

Mark, can we get christy involved?  Thanks everyone.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: The rumor mill
08/31/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

There's never been a better time than NOW=20
to pump up your
bandwith!  Here's your chance to learn firsthand how to harness
the power of the Ethernet MAN/WAN revolution. Join Yipes and
The Burton Group at a free,=20
 day seminar, "Just-In-Time
Bandwidth: The Arriva of Optical IP Networks." Produced by
Network World, the leader in network knowledge, this seminar
will put some muscle in your network.  Register for this free
event at http://nww1.com/go/1658732a.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Today's Focus: The rumor mill
There have been a lot of rumors and speculation recently about
the future of Novell. Some have the company being acquired -
by, among others, IBM, Lucent, Cisco, Sun and AT&T - while
others see the company selling off its best technologies
(eDirectory and file caching) to separate companies.

Neither of these will happen in the near future, the next six
to 12 months. The company is making money, although not a lot
of money, and it does have a significant amount of cash on hand
with little or no outstanding debt. But because the stock price
is currently so low ($9 to $10 per share over the past few
months), sale of the company wouldn't bring in enough to
satisfy the stockholders. And any company offering what Novell
stockholders want would be in trouble with its own
stockholders.

Selling off technologies makes even less sense, since it would
leave Novell with more cash (which it doesn=01,t need) and fewer
products to sell.

Instead, watch as new marketing and sales programs are launched
in the fall. These will either boost sales back to 1999 levels
or precipitate a wholesale turnover of top management, leading
to more rumors of a sellout. And those rumors might be true.

Per my voice mail to Vince, Martin Lins offer letter will be provided to him 
on Thursday, August 31, 2000. 

However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally 
discussed.  Therefore, based on his PHD and market information we are able to 
offer him a base salary of 98-100K and no retention bonus.  We can discuss 
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me.  Otherwise, 
please approve salary structure of base 98,000 with no bonus.

Sophie Kingsley   08/30/2000 11:49 AM

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Dale Surbey

Sophie,

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Vince J Kaminski

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Vince

Dale Surbey
08/30/2000 07:49 AM
Vince,

This is the package HR is proposing for Steven.  What do you think?  

- Dale

Sorry Dale, long day, here are the proposed numbers

2 Year Exec
o62,000 Basic  ( currently o55K )
o10K each year kickers
$50,000 worth of options to vest 1/3 1/3 1/3

Let me know what you think.

Steve,

Vince

Chris,

This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.

1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the 
classification based on 3 categories:

 a. variance/covariance  method
                b. historical simulation
                c. Monte Carlo simulation.

Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear 
instrument.

2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation 
of behavior of
all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio.
The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) 
that may
 involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the 
same
model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).

The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the 
ability to capture
the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would 
emphasize that
there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you 
the references 
from home).

3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets 
that are evolving
quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices,
behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).

4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of 
aggregation into
 atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
This process may be a source of a big error.

5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing
of a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlying
can be aggregated into one positions ( they are  portfolios of forwards and 
they are linear
instruments).

Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).

Vince

Dear Vince,

on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

John,

We are trying to hire Rabi De, whose sign-on bonus proposal
was sent to you for approval, for RAC. He will support
vale-at-risk applications, the area where we are hopelessly understaffed.

Vince

Doug,

We were trying to get everybody together for today
but with no luck.  Wednesday next week is the first feasible
date. 

Sorry for that.

 Hello everyone:

The next LNG "Book" meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday,
September 6 at 2:00 pm in EB19C2.

Thanks!

Ashley,

I agree with you. Two trips are the best solution, unless of course Shmuel 
rearranges
the speaker list and the 16th will work for the presentation as well. 

Coordinating so many different events is never easy. Thanks for your
patience.

Vince,

Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club 
(a dining/meeting room) on campus is set for 7:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. on Monday 
the 16th.    I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I 
feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility 
that is near campus.  At this point it may be better to plan on making two 
seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.  Maybe we could 
combine another presentation in during the same visit.  What do you think?

Shmuel,

Let's see if we can either rearrange the seminar speakers
or change the date of our visit to the campus. Ashley Baxter, our coordinator 
is very efficient and
got a faculty room for a presentation on Monday morning on the 16th.

Vince

Dear Vince. I spoke too soon. Apparently the seminar slot on the 16 was
already filled. I will see if I can switch the speaker for that week to the
following week. In any case we are on for dinner on the 16.

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

This is the package HR is proposing for Steven.  What do you think?

Sorry Dale, long day, here are the proposed numbers

2 Year Exec
o62,000 Basic  ( currently o55K )
o10K each year kickers
$50,000 worth of options to vest 1/3 1/3 1/3

Let me know what you think.

Dear Dr. McMullen,

A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
regarding employment opportunities at Enron.

I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a
candidate):

1. mathematical finance
2. computer programming (C, C++)
3. understanding of the energy markets

I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.

I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
opportunities for graduates with different profiles.

Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.

Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

Vince Kaminski

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. Bob Thomas, Shmuel Oren and I invite you to attend the Power
Systems Engineering Research Center's upcoming Industrial Advisory Board
meeting in Oak Brook, IL. It will be held on May 31 - June 1.

As you know from Lance and Alex, this is an opportunity to meet university
researchers and industrial members of PSERC. The meeting also has
presentations on PSERC activities and research projects, PSERC business
discussions, current topic discussions, and a tutorial. Our current topics
discussion will be on ISO/RTO issues, and will involve executives from
several ISOs in dialog with university researchers.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We hope to see you there so
that we can talk about any questions you might have about PSERC.

Shmuel,

The date of our trip to Berkeley has been set. It will be October 16th and 
17th
(Monday and Tuesday).

I shall be glad to make a presentation on energy derivatives markets 
(development of the markets in the US and Europe, valuation difficulties, 
Enron's role
in developing the forward markets for natural gas and electricity).

Please, let me know if this topic would be of interest to you. If this is the
case, I shall follow with a title and an abstract.

By the way, are you free for dinner on Monday?

Vince

Great. Our seminars are 3:30 to 5PM. If it works for you please send me a
title and abstract.

trials run are negative due to defaults.  

Jeff, 

I don't think this transaction makes sense. We should not keep increasing our 
exposure
in one area, given that we can deploy our capital in a more efficient way 
elsewhere,
without taking illiquid, long-term positions.

Chris,

My part has not changed for some time (since early July).

I sent  the last vintage of corrections  to you when I was in Sydney.
You can send the version you consider final to us just to double check.

I took the liberty of sending our chapter to Darrell Duffie and he liked it.
What is more important he did not find any error.

I shell send you my comments on the article for Robin in a day or so.

Vince

Hi Vince,
?
How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have  the latest version of your 
part of chapter 3? (I think GRant has sent thru a  seperate, updated version 
to you, which has been typeset). Everything else has  been tied up and we 
will go with the version we have, unless we hear  otherwise.

Many thanks and best regards.

Althea,

I was trying to get in touch with this guy.
Did he contact you by any chance?  He missed
the interviews on the campus.

Vince

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

                               Can we  meet for a quick lunch again at your

opportunity. Also I noticed in the Risk magazine that Enron Investment

capitalize on internet-based transaction execution of financial derivatives. 
I would like to explore if I can be any help to Hank Finkenstaedt, the 
Director of Enron Investment Partners.

                            Dear Mr. Kaminski:

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Kaminsky:

Thank you very much for arranging the follow-up interview with your

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus

Paul,

Thanks for your message. I am in process of
finalizing my plans for the trip to London in the end of

I had more specific information.

Unless there a major change in my schedule, I shall arrive
in London on Monday morning (September 18) and  leave on
Thursday in the evening.

Please, let me know what would be convenient time
to meet. You can send me an E-mail message and my secretary
will contact to confirm the date and place of the meeting.

management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which

Mr. Kaminski:

I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to 
discuss the draft  PRC 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to 
ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate 
for your employee population.  The generic forms that were presented at the 
PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and 
to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely 
appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical 
areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time 
permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the 
organization.  

One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting  
evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, 
another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to 
the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would 
welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about 
this. 

   

Many Thanks,

I must tell you I have tenured my resignation to Beth Perlman earlier today.
I want to thank each of you for all that you have done for me and with me in 
my employment here at Enron.  It's been a pleasure working with you and an 
honor representing this company.

Grant,

Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility 
curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe 
is marked (especially for the UK), I think we'll find a significant 
difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term 
vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.

Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this 
since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.

Give me a call so we can discuss.

Thanks

Dale

It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy 
iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two 
would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.  
If you would like, please feel free to comment on the attached documents.

of different FT publications, including FT Energy collection).

Shan.Millie@ft.com (Shan Millie) on 08/08/2000 08:50:45 AM
Hullo, Vince:

I hope you're very well.  As you can see, I am now working for the FT's
magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what's currently 
termed
the Expatriate Division and I've just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew
you'd hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having 
gotten
thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I'm investigating 
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them.

Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor, specifically
o HNWIs
o Owner-managers
o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals 
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on
something approaching equal terms

The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including
the "wilder shores" such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on 
a
portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which
will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel
on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future)
offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know 
it's
not bang in your sphere but I'm hoping you'll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me.

If you can give me a few pointers, I'd be grateful. Looking forward to hearing
from you,

Sh?n

I work for the Market Risk RAC London group. I review the quantitative issues 
arising from Enron Europe models.
I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London) 
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.

My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern, 
...), as well as the 
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their 
respective volatility curves.
Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market, 
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility. 
Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to 
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.
 
I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could 
book some time for me in
your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.

Thanks,

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith 
if he has not yet contact you.

Shmuel,

Thanks for the message. I am working with our recruiter, Ashley Baxter,
to finalize the date of the trip. I shall shoot for October the 23rd
if this date works for the rest of our team.

Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you about the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If you can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.

be visiting my son who goes to school in California (we were spending
Easter together for the last three years).

Hello from Texas,

We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run 
into a snag.  We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in 
April (as last year).  However, we can get the hotel and make all our "fun" 
arrangements for the second weekend in April.  However, this is Easter 
weekend.  The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower 
because it's a holiday.  However, we are concerned that holding the meeting 
on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that 
some or many of you may not be able to attend.  

My related question to you is this:

Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose 
a problem for you?  Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you 
may not be able to attend this year's conference.  We need your opinion to 
guide our decision.

Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!

John 

p.s.  We are very fortunate to have Enron return as our corporate sponsor 
again this year.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for the natural gas information. The electricity price
is also definitely of great help if it can be available.

Could you kindly please let me know the contact information for FT or
Megawatt Daily? I will contact them asap to get their permission for the
access of the price data.

Thank you very much and have a great day!

Thanks for your message. 
Everybody who interviewed you was greatly impressed with your technical 
skills and professional attitude.

We shall extend an offer to you within a day or two.

Dear Dr. Kaminsky:

Thank you very much for arranging the follow-up interview with your internal 
clients. I visited Mr. Ted Murphy and his staff at RAC and Mr. Dennis 
Benevides at EES yesterday. I was impressed with level of risk technology 
employed by Enron to achieve its business objectives. I want to reiterate my 
strong interest in joining your group, which is held in very high esteem both 
inside and outside of Enron.? I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Rabi S. De

I understand that you are the lead recruiter for CMU.  As you know, I am the 
only alum from that school in Enron's Associate Program.  I assume I will be 
joining you for our corporate presentation on 9/13 at 7:30am.  Please let me 
know what I can do to help prepare for this event.  Enron and GSIA are a 
great fit, so I want this recruiting effort to go well.

Are you also giving a talk/lecture to the computational finance students?  If 
so, what time?  Maybe we can schedule a lunch with Duane Seppi.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

John Gordon

Ashley.

FYI. What about Oct 16?

have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to 
make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new

We shall send you natural gas Henry Hub prices right away.
Please look at the last winter and the winter of
95/96.

We shall prepare for you the electricity price
information (Cinergy, Cobb and Palo Verde) but
you have to approach FT (the publishers of
Megawatts Daily, a newsletter that produces the price
index we recommend using)  and request the permision
to use the data. We are not allowed to distribute
this information.

Please, explain that this is for academic  research and that

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.

Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?

The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period?

Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!

Dear Vince,

Back in July, when you visited our Sydney office you mentioned extreme value 
theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application 
of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news 
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min, 
etc. 

I am in particular referring to the news article below:

http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm

In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for 
t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in 
particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could 
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis. 

Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has 
a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts 
of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich) 
is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....

Thank you! 

Regards,
Christian

It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy 
iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two 
would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.  
If you would like, please feel free to comment on the attached documents.

Thanks,

Mark,

I fully agree with you regarding general trends. I see  great progress in

I have got CSFB working on the amendment you asked for.

In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market 
values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since 
privatisation.  The following points come out
1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB
2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end 
1998 when the ratio was c1.5x.
3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has 
been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal 
significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in 
share prices in the last year

Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of 
water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market 
value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a 
little.

On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result 
has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I 
await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be 
more modest than the last one !

Jeff,

No problem. We shall invite her for an interview. A/A programs has real

Today's Focus: New Love Letter variant
Here we go yet again.

The antivirus vendors are all sending out alerts warning their
customers of a new strain of the infamous Love Letter virus that struck
last May. This version comes with the subject line of "resume" and
contains an attachment called "resume.txt.vbs".

The file contains a fake resume, though reports vary on whether it is a
German or a Swiss engineer that is profiled. Makes no difference - the
file infects the host computer and then attempts to send itself to
everyone in the local Outlook address book.

It seems as if the virus is targeted at customers of the United Bank of
Switzerland. The new strain attempts to steal UBS account information
off the infected computer. UBS claims that the virus threatens few
people and that most customer data is secure.

For U.S. users, the problem could be more clogged e-mail pipes. But
hopefully, the general user population is now trained to be wary of any
attachment, especially those ending in .vbs. Most of the antivirus
vendors are updating their virus definition files, and protection
should be available shortly, if not already. For more:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0817swissbug.html

Before we get on to today's alerts and patches, I'd like to mention
some upcoming coverage in Network World. A few weeks back I mentioned a
company in London offering "hacker insurance."  A couple of you wrote
in looking for more information. Unfortunately, I do not have the space
to cover such issues here.

Not to fret. Mich Kabay, author of Network World's Security newsletter,
plans to take up the topic in an upcoming edition. Mich has some great
tips for keeping your company network equipment secure, so check out his
newsletter at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/sec/

Also, the features department here at Network World is working on a
feature on the subject of hacker insurance, and they are looking for
help. If you've got something to share, check out our forum:

Just got a copy of the attached paper and thought it may have some interest
for you guys.

On another note, I am putting together a workshop in the spring on the New
Economy and Business Education and will be seeking out some Enron network
people to join in the discussion (2-hours on Friday March 2nd).  I'll let
you know more as we work through the details.  The idea is to "brainstorm"
about the new world you guys work in every day and its implications for
what we should be doing.  Hope this is interesting to you and that you'll
want to spend the day with us.

Take care and enjoy the weekend.

Hello everyone.

This memo only applies to the Research group on the 19th floor that use
the colored printer "Taj Mahal".

Vince has requested that I ask each of you to only use the colored printer
"Taj Mahal" for presentations, newsletters, etc. that require at least 90% 
of color.  These cartridges are very expensive and several times we have
picked up a copy of something that only had color on the first page and it
would be maybe 15-20 pages long.  This is not cost effective.

If you have something that has color on the first page, but not on the rest
of the presentation, then please just print the first page on the color 
printer
and the rest on "Bandit" or "Wagon".

Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

What about going to Wharton in October to attend the E-commerce conference?

Vince

tomczyk@wharton.upenn.edu (Michael Tomczyk) on 08/15/2000 01:37:34 PM
Vince hello,

I just wanted to followup up on our meeting at Wharton and let you know
that there are two upcoming events that you may want to attend - or
designate others from Enron to attend.  Both of these events are good
opportunities to "test drive" the Emerging Technologies program and see if
there is an interest in joining our partner group.

SEPTEMBER 8 - WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?

Our next insight-building event will be held at Wharton on Friday,
September 8 and is entitled "What Next On the Internet?"

This is primarily a Wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas:
1) the New Economics on the Web, 2) Internet, Anywhere, and 3)
Implications for (academic) Research and Education.  Speakers will include
Jay Walker (Priceline.com), David Farber (Chief Technologist at the FCC)
and Mohan Sawhney (Kellog Univ., one of the nation's thought leaders on
e-Commerce), along with several senior Wharton faculty members.

There will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of the
Internet will evolve and the implications for management and management
research.  We are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event,
and participate in the discussion, which should contain some valuable
insights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda.
You are most welcome to participate, or designate a colleague, if you like.

OCTOBER 19&20 - WINNERS & LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUT

This will be a major Impact Conference to explore the coming Internet
shakeout, and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to E-Commerce
and try to determine what we can expect.  It should be an intriguing day.
If you plan to attend please RSVP early since we are sure to be
"overbooked" for this event.  This is probably the best showcase for our
insight-building activities, if you would like to invite any colleagues
help determine if it makes sense for Enron to become a partner in the ET
Program.

If you'd like to RSVP for you and any colleagues who would like to attend
one or both of the events described above,  send me an email reply and I'll
send you a more detailed agenda and speaker description, etc.

I'll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions or
comments you can call or email me next week.

best regards,
Michael

Based on the discussions we had on Monday, August 14th, the preliminary
project timeline shown below, and your request that some Gas Supply Planning
Personnel be available to review and assist with the work:
Data Collection:  August 15 to September 14
Model Design and Building: September 15 to October 14
Interface Design and Building: October 15 to November 15

Gas Supply Planning proposes the following schedule for visits to Houston:
Ketra Schmitt:  September 18, 19, 20  (Model structure)
John Wirick: October 23, 24, 25   (Model test and interface basics)
Jake Norment: November 6, 7, 8   (Interface refinement)

We understand that we should fly into Houston International and stay at
either the Hyatt Downtown or the Doubletree to be near the Enron office at
1400 Smith Street.

Looking forward to an interesting and successful project.

Minor changes I made to Alex's paper.

Vince

Darrell Duffie <duffie@Stanford.EDU> on 08/17/2000 07:37:51 PM
Please respond to Darrell Duffie <duffie@Stanford.EDU>
I read the chapter. Generally,
I like it, and find it non-controversial
and well written. Of course, this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven't discussed.

I thought the amount of attention
paid to OLS and MLE estimation
was a bit overboard, given that you
didn't really exploit it in your
results. If you were to state
the likelihood function for
the GARCH model, it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes, which could then
be thought of as a simple lead-in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use.

By the way, in your discussion of
smiles, you discuss fat tails
extensively. At least for equity markets,
while fat tails contribute, they don't do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia, which you allude to briefly,
using supply-demand language, at the
end of that section.

For the impact of risk premia, see
Jun Pan's paper, which is available
from her web page. But she covers
only SP500, (as do most studies),
and your markets are obviously much different.

The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

Best, Darrell

I can appreciate and share your objective.  Earlier today I sent a separate 
note to Vince forwarding your concerns and asking again for his assistance.  
I'll start there and if needed I'll contact Michael Popkin's structuring 
group.  However, before getting too many people involved I want to see what 
feedback we get from Cairn after they've discussed the offers internally this 
week.

Doug Leach@ECT
08/15/2000 08:37 AM
I gave you several clear alternatives such as contacting Vince's structuring 
group, Michael Popkin's Southern Cone structuring group and a long discussion 
regarding the pricing and suggested "collar." I also asked if you had spoken 
to your customer about what they were willing to pay, but that was a non 
starter. Trust me, I have seen almost every bad deal Enron has entered into 
or attempted to enter into and I am trying to get Metgas to objectively 
relook at their offer to Cairn become it becomes another bad deal.  

Douglas S Parsons@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
08/15/2000 08:31 AM
That's fine, but don't you think I would also prefer not receiving criticism 
that assumes I didn't do something and provides no clear alternative.

Doug Leach@ECT
08/15/2000 07:52 AM
You spoke to me once and I gave you my opinions which were contrary to your 
resultant offer to Cairn. Currently, I have better things to do with my time. 

Douglas S Parsons@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
08/15/2000 12:10 AM
I talked to Vince after we hung up and his only suggestion was to call 
Sandeep Kohli.  I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over 
a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after 
discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears 
to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed 
ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous 
variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better 
deal, please advise.

Doug Leach@ECT
08/14/2000 07:45 AM
I strongly disagree with the pricing and structure of your non-binding offer 
to Cairn. This reminds me of the debacle in Brazil. You should have contacted 
Vince Kaminski's research group as we talked about before an offer was made. 
This is a bad deal. 

Douglas S Parsons@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Doug & Marc,

FYI, please let me know if you think we're totally off base.  I appreciate 
your help.

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001

I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.

Sincerely

W. Fitzgibbon

Mark,

Rice Univ.  wants to produce a coffee mug for the participants of the workshop
Enron sponsors.

Please , take a look at the proposed design. Do we need any formal approval?

Vince:

I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
in.

I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
Cornell.

Thank you.

Andreas,

This looks OK. I look forward to receiving a formal confirmation from you.

Vince

Dear Mr Kaminski

Thank you very much for agreeing to speak at the GARP 2001 Convention.

I will be sending you a formal letter of confirmation in the next few days,
in the meantime I have selected the session below for you and included some
preliminary details; are these correct? I apologize if your details are not
correct but this is the information that was available to me. Is the title
of the session to you liking, or would you like to 'spice it up' a little?

Modelling and Regulatory Requirements
Vince Kaminski, Head of Quantitative Research, Enron Energy

Once again, thank you for agreeing to participate and I look forward to
working with you on this event.

Kind regards

                            INVITATION TO SPEAK

GARP 2001

The 2nd Annual Risk Management Convention

13(superscript: th) & 14(superscript: th) February, 2001 ? Marriott World
Trade  Center, New York

Dear Kaminski

Further to my telephone conversation today with your secretary, Shirley
Crenshaw, and on behalf of the Global Association of Risk Professionals,  I
have great pleasure in inviting you to speak at our 2(superscript: nd)
Annual  Risk Management Convention ? GARP 2001.

This event has rapidly establishing itself as the risk management
industry's  most important meeting point. GARP 2000 reflected the key
concerns of risk  management experts world-wide, with over 400 attendees in
its first year. Three  simultaneous streams address traditional pricing and
risk management techniques,  along with specialised streams addressing new
sectors, such as the corporate  world and the insurance industry. With a
speaker panel of over 55 senior and  executive financial professionals from
investment banks, regulatory bodies,  asset management firms, academics,
insurers/re-insurers, corporate and system  providers this is THE financial
risk management event of the year.

Key areas that this Convention will consider include Market Risk (stress
testing, liquidity, jump diffusion, EVT), Credit Risk (regulation,
modeling,  stress testing, credit portfolio management, credit
derivatives), Operational  Risk, (regulation, data, modeling, validation,
EVT) Advanced Asset &  Liability Management, Corporate/Energy Risk
Management and the Insurance &  Capital Markets.

From my research and discussions with experts in this arena your name was
highly recommended as a speaker for this event. Below is the stream on
Corporate  / Energy Risk Management and I had in mind ONE of the sessions
below for you.  Also, the topic titles are provisional and I am open to
suggested  alterations.

Corporate/Energy Risk Management

   Modelling Corporate Risk ? Risk Management from a Shareholder Value
   Perspective

   Measuring Energy Risk ? Tackling Price Volatility, Adapting VaR,
   Scenario  Modelling and Regulatory Requirements

   Forward Pricing ? Construction of the Forward Curve, Correlations,
   Transparency Issues

   The Volatility Challenge ? Modelling Price Volatility and Examining the
   New Products Designed to Stabilise Volatility

   Energy Credit Risk Management

GARP is a not-for-profit, independent organisation of risk management
practitioners and researchers from leading financial institutions
world-wide.  GARP's mission is to facilitate the exchange of information,
developing  educational programs and promoting standards in the area of
financial risk  management. For more information please refer to our web
site: www.garp.com

I sincerely hope you will be able to accept this invitation and I look
forward to hearing from you in due course. Should you have any questions
please  do not hesitate to contact me, otherwise I will call you again on
to discuss  this further.

Best regards

Andreas

Vince,

I'm following up on our conversation late last week and I'm interested to see 
what your group can advise, per Doug Leach's recommendation.  As you can see 
he is raising a major red flag in regards to our non-binding offer to Cairn.  
Since, it was late the other night I didn't touch base with Sandeep Kohli, 
but Bobby and I are probably the most knowledgeable in regards to the Indian 
gas market.  Please let me know what information you may need from us to 
provide some guidance.

I strongly disagree with the pricing and structure of your non-binding offer 
to Cairn. This reminds me of the debacle in Brazil. You should have contacted 
Vince Kaminski's research group as we talked about before an offer was made. 
This is a bad deal.

Bobby,

After meeting with Cairn today in Delhi, my perception is that our offer was 
received well.  They were more open and relaxed then they were on Wed. 
morning and made several encouraging comments about our price range, (once we 
talked through the price movements), and the seriousness of our gas related 
activities on the West Coast of India, in light of the IOC agreement.  I 
think the overall package is attractive to them and no serious objections 
were raised.  We did talk to some extent about the guarantees, but we didn't 
get too far and they're willing to accept at this point that what's 
acceptable to the LNG suppliers, should be suitable for their needs.  
However, they would like to understand the corporate structure and assets of 
Enron Energy Marketing a little better and I told them I would get back to 
them on that point.

David and Ajay were up in Hazira yesterday looking at some property for their 
gas treatment facility, which apparently is across the road from pipeline 
access.  While there they went and looked at Shell's proposed LNG site after 
walking the last 1 km, inaccessible to their 4wd vehicle and not surprisingly 
found a beach.

In summary, here is what we offered on a non-binding basis:

Six year production plateau
85% TOP
$3.67/MMBtu Net, at a base of $18/bbl Brent, with point of sale at the 
tail-end of the gas processing plant
Floor & Cap of $15.50 - $27.00/bbl
Price movement:  +/- $1.00/ bbl from the $18/bbl base price (on a 3 mo. 
rolling average) equals +/- $0.145/MMBtu fixed on a quarterly basis
Guarantees:  Same protection we're providing the LNG suppliers under the 
Trust Retention Account

I appreciate everyone's help in submitting this offer.

Thanks,
Doug

Doug,

I shall be glad to meet you and help you with the project.
My assistant will call you to set up a meeting latter this week.

Vince--shades of Cuiba
You spoke to me once and I gave you my opinions which were contrary to your 
resultant offer to Cairn. Currently, I have better things to do with my time. 

Douglas S Parsons@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
08/15/2000 12:10 AM
I talked to Vince after we hung up and his only suggestion was to call 
Sandeep Kohli.  I spoke with Marc and yourself four times on this matter over 
a 3 day period and given the timing, I put forth a non-binding offer, after 
discussing it further with Bobby, based on the information I had that appears 
to position us close to our competitors offers.  We haven't committed 
ourselves and should we be selected for negotiations there are numerous 
variables to affect the outcome.  If you've got any suggestions for a better 
deal, please advise.

We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our 
schedules.  I will be back in Houston next week (August 21st), and would 
appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice. 

As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities 
that are more US focused.  I think Paula Corey has already forwarded my 
resume to you.  However, I have attached it to this note just in case.  

I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and 
would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your 
schedule.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Rahul

Niclas introduces himself as an associate in the Research Group.
I think we should clarify his status.

Vince

Hi Niclas,

I am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now, so it might be 
more productive to speak by phone (503-464-8430).  Please leave your number, 
if you get my voicemail.

To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS 
database of plant forced and planned availability.  It seems others in 
Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your 
disposal.  The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR 
available for free (http://www.nerc.com/~esd/).  I know Alexios in RE/EES has 
this.  If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access 
the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.  It 
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you 
could aggregate up.

The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place 
to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious 
"self-reporting" error.  It is available in pdf form from the web site 
http://www.wscc.com/.  Other sources that should be more near-term, but more 
accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the 
BPA Whitebook (http://www.transmission.bpa.gov).

As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the 
reported utility forecasts for loads, or you can go to fundamental data.  The 
ultimate source of the census data collected by the US Dept of Commerce, 
which you can buy on CDROM for cheap.  It would have this kind of information 
by SIC code, by ZIP code.  You may also have access to one of the economic 
forecasting businesses (Wharton's WEFA, DRI, etc.)  They have this in highly 
digested and complete form.

BTW, Tim Heizenrader, who runs Fundamental Analysis and Research on the West 
Desk, is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control.  Is your 
client aware of this resource?

Give me a buzz and we can talk more,
Michael

>>> Niclas Egmar/HOU/EES@ENRON 08/14/00 12:49PM >>>
Michael,

I'm an analyst in the research group. I would like your help with finding 
some information specific for the West Coast. A new analyst on the West Power 
desk needs information on planned outages and planned new generation. He is 
studying the long-term fundamentals of electricity volatility on the West 
Coastso so he also needs info on housing starts, computer sales or industrial 
production figures for computer manufacturing, growth of start-up companies, 
and population stats.

Any help in finding the needed info would be greatly appreciated. Contact me 
or Daniel Kang (new analyst).

you an invitation to this presentation.   Our guest speaker is Mr. Dan Waltz

This Act helps shape how corporate American collects, uses and protects

The presentation is scheduled to begin at 1:30 and will be held in the 50th 
Floor Board Room.  If you have not yet confirmed your attendance to this 
presentation, please call my assistant, Sharon Purswell at 5-7212.   We hope 
to see you there!

Dear Vince:

 I have now spent 16 hours on the valuation project and wanted to touch
base with you to make sure that the basic approach makes sense and that you
think we are making an appropriate amount of progress.  My invoice is
attached.

 By the way, John Martin just mentioned that you have agreed to be our
luncheon speaker at the Texas Finance Festival.  I really appreciate your
help on this and would like to schedule some time next week to talk about
it in more detail.

 I look forward to hearing from you.

regards,

Sheridan

Good morning, Vince!

Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  If you'd rather not, I

it is a sore subject now.

to set an appt. to visit with you.  I checked your calendar and it is pretty 
tight for the next week or so.  Do you want to visit with her and if so do 
you want me to make the appt. for 2 weeks from now?  She is going to call 
back after 4:00 PM today.  Thanks.  Anita

Bad news.

It may be necessary to go to Sydney.

Vince

Vince--

Although I'd love to go to Sydney (2 or 3 days business and add on my 240 
remaing hours of vacation to travel the Outback),

It would probably make more sense for Christian to come here so both myself 
and Joe can work together with him (as well as Jose, Dave & Todd as needs be)

Either way, I agree with you that we need to exploit what he's got to the max.

Dear Sir/Madam,

 I am a student in a Master's programme in Mathematical Finance due to 
graduate in August. My intention upon graduation is to work in a quantitative 
capacity in the
 Power markets and to this end, I am including my resume  in the hope that I 
might be considered for any available position in your risk
 management or structured products group requiring such mathematical skills.

I have addressed this email to your graduate programmes address but I am 
unsure whether or not my candidacy would fall under the umbrella covered by 
your associate programme. If this is not the case, any help in seeing that my 
resume finds the correct destination would be greatly appreciated.

 Yours sincerely,

 Ian McCracken

Thanks for the copy of your paper.

Any comments?

Dear Vince,

1.
Quentin Kerr, 
we will be pleased to do the initial due diligence in an interview. Phil 
Taylor is contacting Quentin and getting him down our Sydney office from his 
university in the next state - Queensland.

2.
re : Christian,
We will be very glad for Christain to interact with Houston research on ".. 
the weather forecasting  technology .."
However, we are very skinny on W staff here ( like Christian is our one & 
only ) , and Christian is doing much work for both the power & weather 
business.

I was thinking that we could run with our initial idea of having Mike Roberts 
come to Sydney. 
There is still time before the Olympics !

Will keep you posted on Quentin.

Regards
Raymond

Paul & Raymond,

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia. 
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot
about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the Sydney office.

1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike 
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lot
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate 
weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip.

Vince

Quentin,

I forwarded your resume to our Sydney office with a request
to invite you for an introductory interview. I would also like  to 
arrange a phone interview with you sometimes next week.
My assistant will call you regarding the timing.

Vince

Chris,

My evaluation form for Jeff.

Vince

   

Vince,
Attached is the evaluation form and resume for your interview w/ Jeff Andrews 
this afternoon at 5pm.  I will bring him to your office at that time.
Jeff is interviewing for a research position within the coal group.  Please 
feel free to contact if there are any questions.
Thanks

Hello Vince :

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical
software. We've recently developed tools well suited for Energy Trading
Industry.

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?

Thank you for your time and help.

Darrell,

Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by
Clewlow and Strickland).

Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is 
less
than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could 
take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same
arrangement as in the previous cases).

Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the
next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron.
Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look
for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
no economic sense. He spent the summer building his
own computer (1000 MHz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker
toiling under his management.

I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.

Regards.

Vince

Today's Focus: Adobe Acrobat PDF vulnerability
Problem with Adobe Acrobat PDF format

Panda Software reported last week that Adobe has issued a patch for
its Acrobat software that is used to read PDF document files. Used to
transmit high-quality reproductions of documents across the Internet,
the format was thought to be secure. But with all things Internet,
there must be a hole. It turns out code can be embedded in a PDF file,
which could be used to deliver a virus, Trojan or other nasty tidbit.
Adobe recommends users install the following patch for protection:

Microsoft releases patch for "Malformed IPX Ping Packet" vulnerability

This patch for Windows 95, 98 and 98 Second Edition, fixes a problem
that could allow an external user to flood a machine using the IPX Ping
command. If a network has a number of machines affected with the
problem, the exploit could be used to flood the network with excess
data packets. For more information and patches:

I shall interview this candidate next week
(a very preliminary interview) to evaluate his potential
and determine if he fits Enron's culture.

Do you see a need for a person with his skills in your area (litigation 
support)?

Vince

Craig,

Thanks for the feedback. Elena is doing really great  and I think that she 
will be
a great Enron's asset.

I wanted to give you some feedback.  Elena Chilkina has gone way above the 
call of duty to help me on a very important research project.  I am trying to 
conduct some research on the global fuels market for Jeff Shankman.  When I 
mentioned this to Elena, she was extraordinarily helpful in helping me 
compile some very useful information on very short notice.  She was able to 
quickly define the scope of the project and gather some pertinent 
information. Because this was not one of her regular assignments, she put in 
many extra hours to help us out on this project.

I just wanted to let you know about a job well done.

Regards,

Craig

The Friday meeting is set at 11:15 in 30C1.  

Zimin

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Hello everyone:

I need your help!  I had a request for an article that was in the February 
2000 
issue of the "Journal of Finance", which the Research Group subscribes to.   
However, when I went to look for that particular issue, I only found two 
issues 
(April and August) for the year 2000.

Please check your desk or home and see if maybe you checked some of 
the missing issues out and let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

David,

Thanks for the invitation. 
I shall check my schedule on Monday and will get back to you
regarding the conference.

I hope you will a very Happy Easter.

Vince

David Warwick <djw@kwi.com> on 04/12/2001 04:04:32 PM
Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

* a general energy risk related topic
* a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
* your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Grant,

I agree. We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms
we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in
London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice. I think we extended a very 
generous offer to him
and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to Enron.

Vince 

   

Vince:

I got the following note from UK HR after had a call from them earlier 
today.  I told them that the deal you and I communicated to Anjam was firm 
and not negotiable (with the exception of the issues regarding the flat 
rental).  Apparently, Anjam is trying to play hard ball.  What's your 
commitment to Anjam?  Should we explore a package deal? My vote is no.

Grant.

Tara Rozen
08/09/2000 12:17 PM
Grant

Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince Anjam that he 
should transfer on a local US package. The difficulty is not so much the 
compensation and benefits, it seems more to do with the actual job and 
long-term prospects. He will only, therefore, commit to 12 months and only on 
assignment terms. 

We explained to Anjam the rationales for transferring locally, ie not just 
cost but equitability among his peers. He is convinced that his skills and 
Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a 
local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for 
you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market 
rate. 

Would you like to move further with this? If so, we can put together costs 
for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think. I am out tomorrow 
but back in on Friday and could do it for you then.

Let us know!

Regards
Tara

Tara,

Can we discuss tomorrrow?  

Thanks
Mel

	Enron Europe
	

Dear Vince & Grant,

Thanks very much for the offer to go to Houston as a Manager to work with 
Tanya Tamarchenko on VAR and credit risk within the Houston Research Group, 
as we discussed on the phone yesterday.  I felt that it would be useful to 
bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this 
morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in 
Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine 
from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an 
urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has 
kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of 
the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I 
expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign 
assignment representative in the near future.

I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to 
make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make 
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working 
with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in 
terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.  
The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron 
Corp is too dramatic and requires me to "burn bridges" and my return to Enron 
Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support 
structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs 
(flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely 
reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they 
justify making the contract a three year (local) one.

I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience & 
value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have 
identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an 
"Excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also 
"Excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my 
existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off 
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,

Anjam

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.

As for (2), yes - i will need a PS reader :o)
Again, let us check Paul's diary on his return before fixing a time for

Paul & Raymond,

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia. 
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot
about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the Sydney office.

1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike 
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lot
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate 
weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip.

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Vice President, FinRad Inc.  NBC

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc.,  a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that  
combine advisory and systems development services to &corporations and  
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to  credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or  academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as  a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure. The  presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity  risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk management.

Vince,

Pierre has informed me that (if you can so co-ordinate with Alison Bailey)
you would like to move the recruiting event on campus for Comp Finance to
Nov 3 in order to co-ordinate with Pierre's invitation to speak in the MSCF
Speaker Series the same day.  I contacted our recruiting center about
availability on that date and have forwarded below his response.  Let me
know how else I can help and, again, thanks for your kind words about the
program and you obvious interest in meeting with us.

Enron currently has 8 interview rooms scheduled on December 11, 2000... As
we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11/3 we currently have
nine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11/3, we
probably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currently
holding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this is
like a game of dominos).  However, Enron could interview off campus, but
that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the
employer.  If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11/3 for just
Comp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.  Our Recruiting
Coordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work for
Enron.  Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know what
their preferences are.  Alison knows how to reach her.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001

I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.

Sincerely

W. Fitzgibbon

Vasant,

Good enough. The last edition includes the discussion of price processes.

One guy, John Neslage, from Corporate/Regulatory Affairs is putting together 
a talk for state regulators and wants to talk about fundamental modeling of 
energy prices.  He was wondering if our group could shed some light on major 
fundamental variables, possibly even for new commodity markets.  I am not 
sure if we have done much fundamental analysis, since we focus mostly on 
option valuation.  Also, since market power is an important variable, 
marginal cost analysis is not sufficient, but if anybody has any info, please 
let me know.  I have referred him to the "Managing Energy Price Risk" book.

Thanks,
 Vasant

Joe,

I have written to Pal Quilkey to invite Christian Werner to Houston
for a week to discuss how much of his research we can use.

Vince

Vince,

 I have inquired into Christian's climate models. It seems to me like a long 
term project. Chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than 
the Australian Met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and 
that they are an "old boy's network"  resistant to new developments, but I 
don't think the same can be said of most other weather services. As far as 
the NWS goes, they run their model on a Cray, they have several very talented 
PhD's working on it full-time,  and even then, they can only get a dozen or 
so runs per night. In other words, it's a huge system. Replicating something 
even close to that will not be an easy task. 

 That being said, I think there are related applications that we could look 
into.  Since I've already promised the RAC group and the weather desk's PJM 
traders to put together a Vector AutoRegressive model of daily temperatures, 
I think it makes sense to see if something better than a VAR model can be put 
together, perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model Christian 
has. What I have in mind is something  that would give us say, up to several 
dozens of "possible" temperature forecasts every morning, which would be 
calculated using actual climate models (as opposed to time series models). I 
would not use this as a forecasting tool (the NWS model results would make a 
far better  "best guess"), but our ensemble could still be used to provide a 
distribution of temperature scenarios. This ensemble would have several uses:

 1) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a 
more realistic daily V@R for the Weather Book (and eventually interface that 
with the power desk's V@R calculations)

 2) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to 
week-ahead CDD and HDD distributions (for use in our demand swaps)

 3)  if Freese-Notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts, 
e.g., "expect the trough to recede" we could sort through the different Monte 
Carlo scenarions, find one in which the trough in question is receding, and 
use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures 
corresponding to that scenario. Up till now, we haven't found a good way of 
getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean 
temperature-wise

 4) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such 
models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns. The 
traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly 
match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen; 
although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating 
month-ahead or season-ahead weather (trust me on this) we could still use the 
visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations.

 Just today, I've spoken with Dr. Jacobsen of Stanford University, who has 
written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who 
worked with UCLA's general circulation model.  He says that getting a 
simplified version of MM5 (which is itself a simplified, limited-area version 
of the GCM models that NWS, COLA, and UCLA use) would take several months to 
implement,  assuming the people involved are already well versed in the 
technology. Also, I have contacted AER, a Massachusetts- based weather 
consulting firm, and they tell me that they have a MM5 model running daily 
(only one run per night), and also some smaller PC models up and running. 
They are of course willing to work with us for a fee. Their MM5 version runs 
on a $200,000 parallel processor.

 I am open to your suggestions (or objections as the case may be). I'm not 
sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of 
Enron, and not just the weather desk.

 I am scheduled to go to Boston next week anyway, and would like to use the 
opportunity to visit with AER. I will of course coordinate any projects with 
Christian (if we get something like this up and running it will be more 
likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own Australian 
model).

Dear Vince,
?
Thanks for your call the other day regarding  EPRM's upcoming enterprise risk 
management conference. We seem to be making  progress and are pulling 
together some interesting subjects for inclusion this  year. I am currently 
at a stage where there are plenty of possible sessions and  over the next 
week I will be able to decide of which will stay and which will  go. 
?
I have attached a file that gives an indication  of the topics that have been 
identified so far. Although I have bullet points  for the sessions I would 
first like to identify interested parties and then work  with them to develop 
a session that reflects their particular expertise and  experience. I also 
think that by continuously developing the points we can make  greater 
allowances for continuity between each participant.
?
Based on our discussion I would be extremely  interested in inviting you to 
lead a session on the main conference. You seemed  to have an interesting 
view on operational risk and the particular challenges  that are presented 
within the energy industry. This session will run on  Thursday, November 
16th. The title is reasonably broad at this stage and any  suggestions are 
welcome.
?
Your overall views on the current conference content is also  welcome and if 
you feel that another session is more suited to your work do not  hesitate to 
contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Karl Tomlinson@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Vince,

To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious 
plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage.

The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best 
option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along 
with relative network performance from a few points.

I am currently chasing NEMMCO (AU system operator) to get hold of a few weeks 
of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough 
measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas.

The idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will 
introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then 
reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. The drop 
in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may 
change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the 
network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion 
devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.

The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker 
is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will 
cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network. 
Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many 
miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point 
on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the 
solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made 
more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed 
(i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a 
DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure 
to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be 
sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !

Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.

Karl.

Shirley,

Please, put it on my schedule.

Amy,

I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a 
reasonable decision.

We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain 
clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a 
rather
vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

Vince

Vince: Can you shed any light on this? I'm confused (really confused).... 
Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only 
by Kean, Buy and Koening? And
Do you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs?
Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and 
start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the 
Lab. 
From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole 
thing, Rick's issue of "where AA is going with this" is really a mute point, 
isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort. 
Would appreciate your insight and advice.
Thanks.

They approached us about the possibility of licensing this technology to us.

Under the nondisclosure agreement, we have to give them an answer in 90 days
and tell them why we don't want to use it (if we decline the offer).

Please, don't circulate the paper to other members of the group without 
letting them know that it's confidential and should not leave Enron.
In any case, please, let me know who else saw the paper.
We should make sure that the circulation is limited so that it does not

Hi Kirstee,

Thanks again for all your work on MG. One think to double check is units.
Please, make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions 
come in.

One potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing 
with different
cultures (metric system vs. English measures).

Hi Vince,
I was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the 
full mailing list. Basically it suggests that the 
copper option position may well have increased the VaR by more than $500,000. 
However, given that the portfoilo has also 
changed from the 1st of August it is difficult to asses the actual change due 
to the option only.
Regards
Kirstee

	Enron Europe
	

Hi all,
The CU option position has entered the MG books for the 2nd Aug. The delta is 
35299$/mt for Dec 2000. The Cu VaR has gone up 
from $2,245,000 to $3,306,000. I estimated that the portfolio for the 1st 
would increase to approx $3,039,000 so this seems sensible. 
The overall VaR change is from $4,780,796 to $5,991,569. Again, the estimate 
for the 1st Aug was for an increase in VaR to ~ $5,476,000.
All estimates were based on a delta of 32,0004/dmt.
There has also been some increase in the VaR for Aluminium which will effect 
the overall total.
A summary is as follows :

Tried to find time to catch you when I was in the States during the week 
beginning 10Th July.
Best I managed was to say Hi on the bus one morning.

I wanted to tell you that I taking over responsibility for setting-up EES 
Europe's Risk Management activity and would like to talk to your guy's about 
ways in which they can help me. I know that you are providing a service to 
retail in US. 

Maybe we can talk, or one of your team give me a call.

I am out later today for the rest of the week but will be back in the office 
from Monday.

The introduction looks fine. I  have made some cosmetic changes
(typos and split infinitives that slipped  by). You can safely ignore most of
them.

Vince,

Hope you are well.

We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?  
you
kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We
realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote
something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the
preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts  
are.

Thanks,

Preface

One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk
Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches 
for  the
pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss 
in-depth
the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope 
to
help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of 
energy
derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent
modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is  
very
important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the
dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities 
to
your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different
instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?).
However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or 
models,
at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should 
rest
with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the
model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible
of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can
make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.

In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In
chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to? 
model  and
price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In
addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes
modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees 
and
Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the
book.

In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as
analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that  
can
be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric
Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump
processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their
parameters estimated.

Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of  
Enron
Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This
chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,? 
merits
and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing
models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity
markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of
calculating  volatility.

Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such 
curves
are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the
difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined 
curves.
In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the
building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three 
main
approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy
markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving
analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.

Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative
markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this
chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as 
energy
swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback 
options,
and ladder  options.

Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot 
price
and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions
for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on
the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this
chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest
rate  model.

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent  and American style options 
can
be evaluated for the models in? Chapter  6. Simulation schemes are? developed
for the evaluation of European  style options and applied to a variety? of 
path
dependent options. In  order? to price options which incorporate early  
exercise
opportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This  tree? is built to 
be
consistent with the observed forward curve and  can be used to? price exotic 
as
well as standard European and American  style options.

Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for  valuing energy options based on 
modelling
the whole of the market  observed? forward curve. The approach results? in a
multi-factor  model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a
wide range  of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structures
can  be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?  developed 
for
pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte  Carlo? schemes are
presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter  closes with a discussion of
the valuation of American style  options.

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of  energy derivative positions. ? 
In
this chapter we discuss the  management of price risk for institutions? that
trade options or other  derivatives and who are then faced with the problem? 
of
managing the  risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a  portfolio
containing derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma  hedging ? 
illustrating
the techniques using both spot and? forward  curve models. The general? model
presented in Chapter 8 is ideally  suited to multi-factor hedging of a? 
portfolio
of energy derivatives  and this is also discussed.

Chapter 10 examines the key  risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)
applied to portfolios  containing? energy derivative products. After? 
discussing
the  concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?  (volatilities,
covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then  compare the fours
major? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,  Delta-gamma, historical
simulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,  applying each to the same portfolio 
of
energy? options. In this  chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates 
for
various  underlying energy market? variables.

Finally, in Chapter  11 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We 
look
in  detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan  
(1997))
and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products  (1997)) for which 
detailed
information is publicly available. Together  these provide an extensive set? 
of
tools with which to measure credit  risk. We present numerical examples of
applying these techniques to energy  derivatives.

Before? we begin we stress that the models and  methods we present in this 
book
are tools? which should be used with  the benefit of an understanding of how 
both
the ?tool?? and the market  works. The? techniques we describe are certainly 
not
?magic wands?  which can be waved at? data and risk management problems to
provide  instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics  
Technical
Document ?? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace  experience and
professional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,  the right tools, 
correctly
used make the job a lot?  easier!

I am sending you an updated version of the MG VaR memo, following the 
discussion
Grant and I had with Bjorn Thursday evening.

Please, let me know if you think more changes are required.

Tony,  Aug 26th

Steve,

I shall call you tomorrow about it. My preference is to move Anjam to Houston
for some time. Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions
and it's better to prevent a potential leak. I have discussed this issue
with Dale and Richard  and  they concurred.

I don't  expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than 
sorry.

Vince

Steven Leppard
08/02/2000 03:08 PM
Hi Vince

If you're currently engaged in drawing up contingency plans for the Anjam 
situation, have you arranged for a "snapshot" of his computer directories to 
be taken?  We all tend to use our personal areas (on our H: drives) for 
development, and obviously there'll be a few years of work in Anjam's 
directories.  I wouldn't want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper.  
Although our IT dept. obviously makes backups, I don't know how long they are 
kept for.

Cheers,
Steve

Stinson,

No  problem.

This  has good information - note the phone nos. at the bottom.
> > >
> > > > > WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET:
> > > > >
We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using
your name, address, SSN#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (author of this
piece) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last month and

within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell phone package,

applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line
approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change

my driving record information online, and more.
> > > > >
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case
this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers
and your card numbers handy so you know who to call. Keep
those where you can find them easily (having to hunt for them is additional
stress you WON'T need at that point!).
> > >
File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was
stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a
first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
> > > > >
But here's what is perhaps most important: I never ever thought to
do this. Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SSN#. I had never heard
of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen
and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.
> > > > >
By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the
theft all the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit
checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about
before placing the alert). Since then, no additional damage has been done,
and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It

seems to have stopped them in their tracks.
> > > > >
The numbers are:
Equifax 1-800 525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW) 1-800-301-7195
Trans Union 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration also has a fraud line 1-800-269-0271

We pass along jokes, we pass along just about everything... do think
about passing this information along... it could help someone else

You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  "Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
"hypothetical" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence.  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.  Hope to 
see you there.

 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the "Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA)," and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

Jeff,

I am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the Wharton
School, following my visit with Tom Piazze in May. Tom is a Corporate 
Relations Officer
at Wharton.

Recommendation.

I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.
The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate
Wharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,
the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies 
worldwide.

The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $100K-150K,
that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, 
Citigroup,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., Intel, and many others.  The contribution is executed 
through
grants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The 
choice
of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time
depending on the business needs.

Benefits to Enron. 

Enron can benefit from the Partnership by:

 - gaining advance access to current academic research  
 - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus,
   enhancing   our recruiting efforts
 - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant
                   influence on public opinion
        - gaining access to high quality executive education programs

Specific Programs.

The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. 
I have
identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.

1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella
    for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research 
and 
    corporate engagement related to e-commerce.

    Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and
    enhanced recruitment opportunities.

2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary
    program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing 
intellectual
    property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal
    organizational structures.

    Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of 
valuation of
    intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.

3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for
    assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the 
scope
    of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments). 

    Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination
    of information about our capabilities in this area.

Potential users of the program at Enron.

My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and 
Decision Process Center.

Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of 
Enron can be involved 
with  Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.

pertaining to the type of research  that should be introduced to Enron .

On Tuesday , April 4th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area , "The Bakersfie=

=20
from the U.S. congress  set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of=20
methane hydrate. This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy=20
source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development. =20

According to this article, the ice-like deposits of frozen methane have an=
=20
energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels=20
combined.

I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it=

Send me you FAX number or call me at Enron Wind Corp. 661-823-6433.=20

Also when I was in engineering  student back in 1985,  I did an independent=

Do you remember about Exceed?

Vince

	Clayton Vernon @ ENRON
	07/27/2000 03:08 PM
	
to the group:

if you wish to use SAS, there are a few simple things you need to do:

1) you need to get a Unix password if you don't already have one (your user 
id will be the same as on the NT network, but a different password is issued)
2) you need a program called "Exceed" on your PC.  request it from IT (you 
already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform)
3) you need an "ftp" program on your PC. you can go to www.download.com and 
download one (i like wsftp)
4) Exceed is funny in the way it runs. When you invoke Exceed (or LIM 
Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install 
itself the first time, and will then "disappear" to the Taskbar. you need to 
*right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose "Tools" and "Client 
Startup" and then "New."

You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow 
emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and 
Password, set the Host Name to: 

capers.ect.enron.com

and then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):

/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @D

Then, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! 
menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the 
serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home 
directory. From here, if you simply type "sas" the 3 windows for an 
interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.

5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the 
software, and then create a new session called "enron" where you choose as 
the server simply "earth" (do not add any further descriptors such as 
.enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the "remember 
password" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, 
host type as "automatic detect").

when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home 
directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in 
under Exceed.

if you have any problems, i'll be happy to help

Clayton

PS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll 
just write your name down when you take them.

Beth,

Thanks for the quick reply. I cannot access the body of
the message.

This is just a reminder about the "care package" of Enron cases and

Vince and Stinson,

I did some reserach on the option visualization.  Here is one of the findin=
gs.

Check this web site, the image looks impressive: =20
http://home.online.no/~espehaug/VirtualWorld/VirtualOptionWorld.html
This is done through a free software LiveGraphics3D and Mathematica.=20

Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is goo=
d=20
enough for our purpose.

Zimin

PS:
What Is LiveGraphics3D?=20

     LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
     rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
     HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
     non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
     and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
     Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
     commercial purposes.=20

     LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
     three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
     a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
     Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
     can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
     software.=20

     Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
     stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
     backgrounds. =0F%=20

Grant,

with the people in Research.  He also mentioned that I should email you to 
find out if you want anyone from any other department to interview Rabi.  I 
am currently scheduling interviews with you, Krishna, Grant, Stinson, Zimin

Quentin,

Thanks for your message. We are always looking for new employees
with the right skills.

Please, send me your resume and I shall determine what is the best
way to arrange an interview. We can interview you in Sydney and then 
bring you to Houston for another round of interviews.

Vince

Dear Dr. Kaminski

This is Quentin Kerr from Australia, I just came back from the Sydney's
conference. Glen Dixon has told me that you are interested in my work. It is
always my honor to work with you. I am currently a PhD student at the
mathsmatics department of the university of Queensland (aiming to finish my
thesis at the end of this year). My research interest is financial
mathematics, in particular, energy market modeling and derivatives pricing.
Now I send you copies of my first paper (submitted to the Applied
mathematical finance) and my talk (the full version of the academic paper
will be available in 2 weeks). Any comment will be appreciated.

PS: attached with the talk at the conference.

Best regard
Quentin

Shirley,

Please, send it to the entire group.

Vince

This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for
cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enron
a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.

Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch 
boxes
on the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that 
your mothers 
don't work here.

Hi,
I have run the VaR with updated factor loadings for the gold,silver and cocoa 
bean positions. The biggest change in VaR from 
adding this information has been to the Cocoa bean position which has 
increased from approx $45,900 to $506,553.
The overal VaR has not changed by very much as the position file I was sent 
from Andreas had not changed from the 26th - I 
have queried this and it will not be a problem to re-run the numbers on 
Monday if I recieve a further file.
The VaR summary for all the metals is as follows :

Also, after having a conversation with Bjorn about stress/scenario analysis I 
thought I might quickly try to set up a few scenarios to 
see how sensitive the VaR is to a position change in Aluminium, Nickel and 
Copper.
I have only applied position increases (thge direction of the shifts are 
dependent on the monthly outright position direction) up until Dec2000.
The shifts and results are given in the following attached spreadsheet.  

It is interesting that the individual VaR's are particuarly sensitive to 
increasing the position for Nickel.
I would like to discuss these results on Monday and any further suggestions 
for senarios would also be gratefully recieved.

Have a good weekend,
Kirstee.

Hi Vince,
I apologise that I did not send you the following mail ...
Kirsteee

Hi Andreas,

I have run the VaR model for the 26th July and have attached a zip file of 
the results:

The total VaR is $4,170,653 and the Cu position is $1,852,876.

I have had trouble getting hold of you so I thought I would summarised what I 
wanted to talk about (also I thought 
I would give your ears a rest!)
Basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday (we briefly 
discussed it earlier). 
The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 
5 day period of adjustment to calculate 
the risk (in this case it is called Capital at Risk). The VaR calculation for 
our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24. 
Since :

Old risk factor (%) =  1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.99%
 
New daily risk factor = 3.99/2.24  = 1.78%    which actually equates to std 
of approx 1.1% a day.
I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we 
are showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.

Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give a 
VaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that the 
figure we estimated ($3,100,568).
The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term 
structure of the price curve/vol curve and position 
curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means 
that it is difficult to compare the numbers.
I hope that this helps to explain our number.

Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,
Cheers
Kirstee

 

Again , I should have also sent the following mail yesterday.
...I guess now I should also apologise for filling up your mail box!
Have a good weekend, 
Kirstee

Hi - I have run the model for the 26th and have the following results :

I have also updated the correlations to include silver and the gold.
The TC delta (treatment charges) are positions only for copper conentrate and 
do not 
contain any positions due to zinc or lead.
Could you take a look at the figues as this is the first time I have done a 
full run and 
would like to make sure that I have done things correctly.
I will definitely call to discuss the prices for gold and cocoa beans - the 
TC price curve is 
another issue however, at the moment we do not have anything other than a 
spot price and 
a 1 year price so I think we will probably have to set it as a constant.
I have to talk to Andreas soon as he is awaiting my comments on point (2) of 
his email that 
I forwarded in my last mail. 
Also, you will can see that I have subtracted any positions that are from R 
Wolf in the Mercur download - 
this was point (1) of his note.
As a quick question?
Do you think it is worth including Zinc concentrate (18400 dmt) and lead 
concentrate (920 dmt) ?
I think we may need to check the TC price for these and the conversion for 
the one given in the model for copper as 
I think that the original historical price file (TChistory) is quoted in c/lb 
- I guess this is cents/pound? rather 
than $/dmt which is the units that position is quoted in .
 
Speak to you soon
Kirstee

Vince,

I hope your day is going well.  We seem to have temporarily run out of new 
people to feature.  Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  I 
think that in the future, I would like to feature Tanya's daughter Sofya, and 
also perhaps see if we can cover some people in our offices overseas.  If 
they can produce the photographs over there, it should be workable. 

Until then, would you like to contribute?

Thank You!

We would like to bring this student as a summer intern (the last one,

Kevin,

Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
transfer will be rejected. Anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody.

Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
aware of it, because I have
serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.

Vince

Thanks for your message. I am familiar with the Computational Finance  program

Vince,

Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
for the Research Group at Enron.

In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron
(mary.alison.bailey@enron.com) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces.

We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
"Speaker Series"  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.

When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?

Thank you for your time.

Eric,

I have the presentation  on my laptop  and I
shall send you the presentation in a few days when
I get my back to my office in Houston.

I am currently using the system as a guest in our Sydney office.

The  person I mentioned is Anthony Dayao.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

My name is Eric Takigawa of Algorithmics Japan, and I spoke with you on the
last day of the seminar.

I would be pleased to receive a copy of your presentation with the promise
of non-circulating the material.

I have been in communication with Mr. Jonath Whitehead and will be meeting
Mr. Joe Hirl in early August.  You mentioned another individual at Enron
Japan - Antonio Dai(?) but couldn't recall the proper spelling of his name
and would like the opportunity to meet with him.

There is a tremendous opportunity for Enron in Japan and the conditions are
just right.

Kind regards,

Eric

Anjam,

We can use moment matching to find the "effective" volatility and dividend 
yield for the average.
Then we can apply the European digital option formula.   Attached please find 
the c-code I did
for  Asian spread option, when I find the effective vol and drift for both 
averages then find the option
value by calling the European spread option.  You can do just the same for 
the Asian digital option.

It would be nice to do a Monte-Carlo, just checking the accuracy of the 
approximation.

It was nice to have you here, we are impressed by the work you have done.
Keep up the good work.

Zimin

   

Hi Zimin,

Russell Placket of MG Metals just talked to me about the issue of pricing a 
strip of twelve monthly Asian digital options on LME aluminium.  As I 
understand, the payoff to the customer is a fixed cash amount that wil be 
paid if the average of the closing prices of aluminium for a month are 
greater than the strike agreed in advance, where holiday days do not 
contribute to the average.

Russell mentioned that this would be a set of 12 monthly options starting in 
Jan-01, and that the LME price for Jan-01 of $1572.5 (which is the future 
converging to the spot price on the 3rd Wednesday in Jan 01) can be used as a 
proxy/estimate for the average for the month.

Do you have a model for asian digitals or should I proceed with Monte Carlo 
to price this, maybe using European digital option model as control variate?

Thanks,

Anjam

Dear Vince,

I hope your trip to Australia was successful. It's one of my favorite places
to go.

I've copied you on the email to Mike initiating Enron's trial service to
Energycast. Thanks for helping to set this up.

Would you ask the authorities in Enron to refresh my access to Enrononline?
My Guest User ID as ENA61296 and my guest password was TR84BY13. They no
longer work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as we
were in full development mode on Energycast.

Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in
Nepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference -- not satisfactory. If
your traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron consider
linking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotes
and regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, as
our service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for your
traders.

Let me know what you think.

Ed

Clayton,

Thanks.

if you wish to use SAS, there are a few simple things you need to do:

1) you need to get a Unix password if you don't already have one (your user 
id will be the same as on the NT network, but a different password is issued)
2) you need a program called "Exceed" on your PC.  request it from IT (you 
already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform)
3) you need an "ftp" program on your PC. you can go to www.download.com and 
download one (i like wsftp)
4) Exceed is funny in the way it runs. When you invoke Exceed (or LIM 
Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install 
itself the first time, and will then "disappear" to the Taskbar. you need to 
*right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose "Tools" and "Client 
Startup" and then "New."

You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow 
emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and 
Password, set the Host Name to: 

capers.ect.enron.com

and then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):

/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @D

Then, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! 
menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the 
serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home 
directory. From here, if you simply type "sas" the 3 windows for an 
interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.

5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the 
software, and then create a new session called "enron" where you choose as 
the server simply "earth" (do not add any further descriptors such as 
.enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the "remember 
password" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, 
host type as "automatic detect").

when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home 
directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in 
under Exceed.

if you have any problems, i'll be happy to help

Clayton

PS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll 
just write your name down when you take them.

Shirley,

Please, request Exceed for all the members of the group.

I propose accelerating Steve's move to head the Research group here.  It 
makes sense to include this as part of the mid-year PRC process by giving him 
a tangible reward along with his performance feedback.

Thoughts?

John Sherriff
27/07/2000 06:44
	

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill 
Dale's structuring role as well so part of the question is 
how we announce Steve's lead research role relative to when we know who will 
take Dale's spot.  Perhaps we should just
move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to 
EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes 
to the organization.

But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a 
wonderfull asset to our efforts.

Thanks!

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.

My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

We would like you to meet tomorrow morning, starting at 9:00,  with a few 
members of the

At 1:00 we would like you to make a presentation to the Research Group on the 
topic
of your choice. After 2:30 we shall continue with individual meetings.

We shall give you an agenda with the names and times when you arrive.

You can come to the lobby of the Enron building (1400 Smith)
between 8:30 and 9:00 and call me (3-3848) or my assistant,
Shirley Crenshaw (3-5290), to be admitted to the building.
We are on the 19th floor.

Look forward to meeting you.

Mark,

Steve's comment has many merits. I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson 
(physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.

On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in 
their time estimates, the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous 
potential payoffs. It make sense to 
stay close to them and  to explore potential investment opportunities.

Vince

Steven J Kean@EES
07/26/2000 05:11 PM
I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

informed me that Stan cancelled our associate membership with AGA effective 
January, 2000.  I called Jay Copan with AGA back and left him a voicemail 
with the information.  I asked him to call me if he had any questions and I 
have not heard back from him.  I'll considered it closed unless I hear back 
from him.

One question.   For the summer associates who we would be interested in as 
permanent hires, how do we proceed?    Is there a way of communicating to 
them that we have an intention of extending an offer?   Cantekin Dincerler 
would be one person who would be an excellent addition to our group.   He is 
debating about going to industry or trying to find an academic position after 
he finishes his Ph.D.      Giving him some incentive to seriously consider 
Enron now might have an effect on his plans for next year.

I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this 
memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

Can you figure out the reason for cocoa beans VaR fluctuations?
The same is true of aluminum. I assume this is the position change.

Cantekin Dincerler

Anjam and Kirstee,

As I have suspected the position as of 6/30 vs 7/19 makes the difference. The 
first table first column is my VAR number with 6/30 position and gold&silver 
prices, the second column is your VAR with 7/19 position and dummy 
gold&silver prices. The second table first column is my VAR with 7/19 
position and 6/30 gold&silver prices, the second column is as before.

I would ask you to plug the gold and silver prices and see what kind of 
numbers you get in order to verify we are on the same page. Please refer to 
MODELVAR2000.xls that I have sent you for gold & silver prices and 
volatilities. 

Thank you,
Cantekin

  TABLE 2

Future directions, concerning the outsourcing business, that I think are 
important are:

(1) development of methodologies to speed up the pricing/project development 
process,

(2) adaptation of processes developed for the US to Europe and other markets, 
and

(3) development of pricing methodologies for the mid-market segment of 
facilities.

Ted,

We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
validate some  inputs
before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
London and Houston work
with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.

A few comments.

1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
(Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).

2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
positions and prices on a regular basis.

3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:

 a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
       resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
underlying positions.
 b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
the position numbers (i.e. look
                      into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
       management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
prices (and deltas). They get some
                      option prices by calling brokers.

4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
inputs are right). But, as I have said,
     VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.

Vince 

Zimin Lu
07/25/2000 06:49 PM
Vince & Stinson,

The number comes out from the time series model is 42,  compared with Mike's 
61.

Last  year's number (true) was 41 (7/23/99), and 26 (7/30/99).  Therefore the 
curve is down-sloping dramatically.

Let us see  what happen tomorrow.

Hi Esther,

I just talked to John Sherriff about his "Enron" copper position.  I suspect 
that this is not currently being captured within the MG Mercur position 
database - he would like to have that included in the VaR spreadsheet and 
shown as a separate line.  Do you have any information regarding this deal 
(i.e. position sizes, qualities etc.) or be able to direct me to someone who 
may be able to assist in getting this information?

Thanks,

	Enron Investment Partners
	

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Hi,

I don't know if you have the attached document from Ben Parsons.

As we discussed earlier, Anita put me on your calendar for next Tuesday at 2 
pm to discuss the Duffie project.  I hope that is ok.

Thanks,
Iris

Attached is a description of the parent-subsidiary model that Ben and I have 
been working on over the last few weeks.

Comments welcome!

My first impressions are that R/S can be quite powerful but is not as 
intuitive as it might be (e.g. it has taken me quite some time to understand 
how to manipulate and collate data sets.)
For this reason, I have ordered a "Basics of S" book from Amazon.  If it 
turns out to be useful, I will pass on the title to you.

Rob,

Let me think about a good topic. You may also contact Steve Kean and ask the 
same
question.

Vince,
I'm Regional Mngr Gov't Affairs at NNG in Omaha and begin a doctoral studies 
program this fall at NU. I plan a research emphasis in regulatory politics , 
specific to energy and telecom market convergence and the public interest. 
I'd welcome any advice or suggestions you have regarding other potential 
area's of research, based on your professional experience in the industry.

I appreciate your assistance, I'm in the earliest stages of forming a 
supervisory committee and  curriculum of study.

Shirley,

Yes. It's really nice.

Teresa,

I would like to invite Iris for an interview in Houston.
She works currently in London Can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the States.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the States.

I would hate to pay the 1st class ticket from London to Houston,
though I would go for it, if necessary (I don't
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard

I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more

Clayton,

We can discuss your request  when I come back to the office on Monday.

Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an  explicit prior 
permission from your boss,
myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence.
In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.

Vince

	Clayton Vernon @ ENRON
	07/20/2000 03:12 PM
	
Vasant-

I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered 
from the long flight back.

I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my 
intentions here at Enron.

Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged 
to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In 
addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on 
a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a 
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how 
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit 
purposes.

These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for 
which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines 
elucidating the structure of the data.

I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.

With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has 
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if 
the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been 
researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine 
will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be 
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is 
Compaq-specific.

I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.

I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not 
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the 
other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there 
wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In 
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power 
trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were 
ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they 
have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.  Also, 
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; 
during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to 
how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time 
data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with "well, we 
have it, but we haven't really tested it yet." An example is the weather: we 
still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES 
satellite.

My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only 
if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 100% invested in the 
Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the 
areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the 
Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people 
at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't 
directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, 
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.

As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting 
person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to 
George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are 
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their 
traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with 
Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were 
disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They 
also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid 
on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all 
work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but 
merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years 
as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a 
state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me 
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, 
including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to 
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I 
have learned here.

So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be 
a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you 
in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL 
database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their 
documentation.

As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, 
and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by 
email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data 
warehouse for floor trader support.

Clayton.

approach for the valuation of power plants.
One consultant and researcher, who shares Enron's belief in open markets and 
competition (and therefore is helping us to open Argentine energy markets), 
asked me if we could send him a copy of the booklet or slides that you and 
other speakers presented during the seminar.
If this is feasible, I would appreciate if you could send a copy of the 
material to me at Enron Am,rica del Sur, located at: Av. Eduardo Madero 900 -

Title: OPEC: Arguing over Output
Author: World Oil Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: World Oil ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1275 ,

Saudi Arabia's announcement earlier this month that it would increase oil 
production by an additional 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) if prices 
remained high ignited a firestorm within OPEC.* The announcement was 
upsetting to fellow OPEC members because

* it was a unilateral statement with no advance consultation

* most observers perceived Saudi Arabia to be acceding to US pressure

* it came on the heels of the June 21 OPEC meeting where a 0.7 mbd production 
increase was adopted with some difficulty

* it seemed to contradict an expressed Saudi view that the oil market was 
fundamentally balanced and that only structural and psychological factors 
were distorting prices

Subsequent to the furor it raised, Saudi Arabia backed away from promptly 
implementing a production increase and sought instead to develop an OPEC 
consensus in favor of higher output.

Saudi Arabia's thwarted initiative has now become enmeshed in the production 
adjustment mechanism advocated over the past year by Venezuelan Oil Minister 
and current OPEC President Ali Rodriguez. Having refrained at the March OPEC 
meeting from accepting the Rodriguez adjustment formula to add or withhold 
0.5 mbd of oil whenever the price of the OPEC crude basket is above or below 
$22-28 per barrel for 20 consecutive working days, Saudi Arabia has sought to 
justify an increase now on the basis of a sustained OPEC basket price above 
$28 per barrel. The market, however, has moved in opposition to the various 
OPEC signals, causing the basket price to fall below $28 on July 17, short of 
the 20-day period. Iran--which adamantly opposes a production increase since 
it is operating at capacity and would see its oil revenue decline--has led 
the opposition to the Saudi initiative and is insisting that the conditions 
specified by the Rodriguez formula have not been met.

The oil market continues to react to contradictory statements by OPEC member 
spokesmen, and on July 18 prices for WTI settled up $1.11 at $31.90 per 
barrel and prices for Brent increased $0.76 to $29.72. This increase was in 
reaction to an OPEC signal that it intends to restart the 20-day price period 
which could delay OPEC action on a production increase by at least four weeks.

Uncertainty about an OPEC production increase is the key factor supporting 
prices. This, in turn, leads to continued pressure on OPEC to implement a 0.5 
mbd production increase. The "20 consecutive day" mechanism is not, however, 
a final arbiter of OPEC production policy. For OPEC members who are amenable 
to the Saudi view on production, the mechanism is more likely to be used as a 
rough gauge of the global market and not as an automatic trigger to implement 
or--as the case may be--to delay a supply increase. In addition, the Saudis 
are capable of acting on their own in the old-fashioned way--quietly further 
increasing output above their quota. More OPEC gyrations are 
coming--including the Secretary General's impending visit to Caracas--but, 
unless the market settles beneath OPEC's upper limit soon, we expect that 
some additional OPEC oil will be produced, however the increase may be 
justified.

Title: Monthly Briefing: The Pressure Remains
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1272 ,

Pressure in the North American gas markets remains intense, despite moderate 
summer weather that so far has allowed storage injections to average over 10 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. High injection rates have provided 
occasional relief for prices, but summer is far from over. The absolute level 
of storage inventories remains critical, and the prices should stay above the 
$4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) level through August. The 
competition between power generation and storage for supply will continue, 
and gas prices must remain high enough to discourage marginal end-use demand 
and allow low storage inventories to build. CERA expects an average price of 
$4.20 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub for August (see Table 1), which will result 
in continued burning of residual fuel oil by the Atlantic Coast dual-fuel 
market and continued ammonia plant shutdowns, which began during the May and 
June price increases.

Although continued strong storage injections would take some pressure off the 
gas market, a shift to a lower pricing plane--below $4.00 per MMBtu--depends 
on sustained mild summer weather. CERA expects gas demand for power 
generation to climb through the end of July and into August, and higher 
temperatures and power loads will limit supply that is available for 
injections. The pressure in the market is likely to tighten over the weeks to 
come, and the market will remain vulnerable to price spikes above $4.50 per 
MMBtu through August and September.

Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough
Despite recent high storage injection rates, storage inventories are not high 
enough to ensure that supplies will reach adequate levels for next winter. An 
end of mild weather in the Midwest and Northeast and seasonally intense heat 
in the Southwest would cause injection rates to decline significantly over 
the remainder of July and into August. The result would be injections 
averaging approximately 9.0 Bcf per day for July, largely owing to higher 
rates early in the month, and 7.0 Bcf per day for August (see Table 2).

These rates would keep the year-over-year inventory deficit above 350 Bcf for 
July and August, with inventories on a path to reach between 2.7 and 2.8 
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of October, still an all-time low level 
for the beginning of winter. Reaching even this level would require at least 
two of the following to occur: a continuation of quite mild weather, little 
or no hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, or warm weather through 
October. As a result, the pressure is likely to remain high in the gas market 
at least through August.

Regional Markets--The Topock Premium
Buoyed by strong regional power demand and high utilization rates on 
pipelines into California, Topock continues to be the highest pricing point 
in North America. High power loads in the West are supporting other prices in 
the region, but supply growth and pipeline capacity constraints out of the 
Rockies and high pipeline utilization rates between the San Juan Basin and 
California have maintained extremely wide differentials between those markets 
and California. California should remain strong, and CERA expects some modest 
strengthening in Rockies and San Juan basis differentials during July and 
August with increasing Pacific Northwest gas demand for power generation (see 
Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Continued strong supply growth in the Rockies is challenging 
pipeline capacity out of the region, and differentials have come increasingly 
under pressure this summer. CERA expects some modest recovery in Rockies 
differentials as hydroelectric generation on the Pacific Northwest declines. 
Differentials should average $0.55 per MMBtu for August.

* San Juan. CERA expects continued strong power loads in the West to keep San 
Juan prices near current differential levels. August differentials should 
average $0.35 per MMBtu for August.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Hotter weather and higher power loads in Texas 
have already strengthened differentials at the Permian Basin, and that 
tightening should hold through August. The Mid-Continent should continue to 
price at a discount to Permian supplies.

* Chicago. Chicago prices have held just above $0.05 above the Henry Hub for 
much of July, a condition CERA does not expect to change significantly during 
August. Chicago should average $0.06 above the Henry Hub.

* Northeast markets. Mild weather in the Northeast quickly cooled price 
premiums from the mid-$0.40s to the mid-$0.20s from early to mid-July. With 
hot weather still likely to return, however, New York prices for August 
should average $0.32 above the Henry Hub.

Canadian Markets--Western Supply No Longer in Decline?
Although TransCanada flows are down, the strong market overall and wide 
differentials have resulted in increased flows on PGT (up 300 million cubic 
feet [MMcf] per day year-over-year). Domestic demand is still down slightly 
from last year's levels. Storage injections have picked up (in both the East 
and West) and, although behind last year's, are still above the five-year 
average. Western Canadian supply increased slightly on a year-over-year basis 
in June; July thus far is basically running flat with last year.

The impact of the 1999 TransCanada capacity turnback and the current rate 
structure is beginning to be felt in the Canadian market. It is more and more 
apparent that TransCanada is becoming the swing pipeline, with flows 400 MMcf 
per day below last year's levels. The effect of the difference between 
contracted capacity (available to shippers at incremental cost) and 
uncontracted capacity (available only on a full-cost basis) is becoming 
evident. With supply filling contracted capacity on export pipes, the 
inability of TransCanada to discount below the minimum interruptible rate may 
be creating a two-tiered market. This shift results in a different netback 
for holders of capacity (similar to the higher netback achieved by the 
aggregators in the past) and those without capacity (those required to 
acquire full cost transportation, or to sell at AECO). This lack of 
flexibility is contributing to the wider differential between Henry Hub and 
AECO (currently averaging in the high U!
S$0.70s). AECO is expected to average C$4.91 per gigajoule (US$3.52 per 
MMBtu) for August.

    Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on
   the same night.
   If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has
   not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word
   would be "meetings".
   There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."
   People who want to share their religious views with you almost never
   want you to share yours with them.
   And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories,
   decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His
   messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.
   You should not confuse your career with your life.
   No matter what happens ... somebody will find a way to take it too
   seriously.
   When trouble arises & things look bad, there is always individual who
   perceives a solution & is willing to take command. Very often, that
   person is crazy.
   Nobody cares if you can't dance well.  Just get up and dance.
   A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice
   person.
   Never lick a steak knife.
   Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.
   "The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,
   religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down
   inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.
   You should never say anything to a woman that evenremotely suggests that
   you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from
   her at that moment.
   Your friends love you anyway.

John,

I shall E-mail the information about SDDP  from Houston.

Vince

Vincent,

You kindly suggested that I email you with regard to some information you
have on the SDDP system (I'm not sure if I've got the abbreviation correct,
but it's something that is currently used in South America).

Your presentation was very interesting and informative.

Kind regards,

John,

I have the electronic versions of my presentations on my laptop. 
I shall E-mail both presentations to you tonight.
Thanks for your interest.

Vince

Vincent,

I had to leave the conference early today, and I've just realised back in
the office as I went through my conference notes that I didn't receive a
copy of your presentation.  I'm not sure whether you gave out copies of your
presentaton or not.  However, if you did distribute copies at the
conference, would you be able to email me a copy?  No problems if you did
not give out copies or if you haven't got a copy handy.

Kind regards,

Dale,

To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to 
55,000
with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.

 I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

Vince

Dale,

I was very impressed with Sharad and I think that we should consider paying 
offering him
 o50,000. I am not sure about guaranteed bonus. What do you think?

Hi Dale (& Vince),

I have now gathered everyone's views and the consensus is that we should hire 
Sharad to work with me on front-office pricing and so we should proceed to 
the offer stage.  As you can see his salary is o43,500 currently and he 
appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.  He would join 
for >o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.  He is very 
interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.  I discussed with 
Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as 
Kirstee Hewitt; I would also like to arrange for a direct reporting line to 
me for Sharad.

Regards,

Anjam 
x35383

P.S. Kate:  I have attached the agencies terms and conditions below:

Anjam, 
??????? as requested please find enclosed details on Sharad's numbers: 
??????? Basic Salary : o40,000 
??????? Car Allowance : o3,500 
??????? (paid in Cash) 
??????? Annual Bonus : o13,000 (this bonus was paid for ??????? 
99-00?? ??????? ??????? ??????? 8 mths work April-Dec) 

Total o56,500 

Sharad has been informed that his bonus payments for year 00-01 will be 
floored at o25,000.? Sharad's expectations therefore are to receive a base 
salary of between o57.5-o60K plus bonus.
I hope this is of use and ask that if you have any questions that you do not 
hesitate to call.

Vince

Vasant,

Anjam and I were just discussing that the telecommunications industry might 
be interested in some type of "solar flare" insurance derivatives.  Please 
let us know if you would be interested in meeting us next week sometime to 
discuss this further or if you have some ideas about it already.  Thank you.

Shalesh Ganjoo

Molly,

Thanks a lot. I am very glad about Jinbaek.

Vince

I've talked several times with Scott Gerson of the Focus Group about the list 
of candidates he has presented to you.  He says that Sriram is "ready to go", 
but that the other NY guys are "kinda iffy".  He did say that they may become 
more interested in Houston if they don't receive NY job offers within the 
next week or so. We have scheduled Sriram to come in to interview with the 
group on Thursday, 4/19, beginning at 9:00 am with you, Vince.   I will keep 
you posted if I hear anything more from Scott.

Spoke with Jinbaek Kim today, and he is very excited about the offer to do a 
summer internship with the Research Group.  We will get his offer letter out 
to him tomorrow, but he has indicated a definite verbal acceptance.

I'll be in tomorrow, but off Friday.  Please call me with any questions you 
might have.

Thanks,
Molly

Dear Vince,

after getting our heads together here,
we would much apprecaite if you could share the Research Group's latest on 
--- 

- Var ie "... repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk..."
 as well as cover additional topics viz.
- Discuss, with application, Enrons internal V@R model, and how this is used 
internally.
- Discuss volatility modelling, and whether it is possible to maintain and 
trade a term structure of volatility in electricity

- Modelling forward curves with reference to associated markets (eg Oil). 
  Can we gain some insights through spreads to related market curves (spark).

I assume your hotel is booked already. Catching the taxi is the best way to 
get to your hotel.
Since you are arriving on the weekend , if you need to contact me - my mobile 
is 0417-692295, home tel/fax

Paul, Raymond,

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics.

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

My name is Guillermo C?novas, and I am Regulatory and Government Affairs 
Director for Enron Am,rica del Sur (Argentina). 
I understand you spoke in a seminar that took place on May 9/10 where it was 
discussed: 1) effective power price modelling; 2) applying a real option 
approach for the valuation of power plants.
One consultant and researcher, who shares Enron's belief in open markets and 
competition (and therefore is helping us to open Argentine energy markets), 
asked me if we could send him a copy of the booklet or slides that you and 
other speakers presented during the seminar.
If this is feasible, I would appreciate if you could send a copy of the 
material to me at Enron Am,rica del Sur, located at: Av. Eduardo Madero 900 - 
Piso 17 (1106) - Buenos Aires - Argentina
Please, do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or 
require further information. I can be reached  at the following number: 
5411-4891-3600

Sincerely,

Guillermo.

Van,

I am leaving for Australia today.

What about the week of the 24th?

Vince

   Van T Ngo                07/14/2000 10:23 AM

Hello Vince, 

Do you have any time today for me to stop by your office?  I just wanted to 
take a few minutes to talk with you.  

Thanks & hope to see you today,
Van

Lloyd,

No problem. I wanted to make sure that everybody realizes how 
detailed-oriented our tasks are
and that we have to be in direct communication with our counterparties.

Vince

   

Vince,

I certainly think Anjam & Tanya should visit NY, but I simply had a concern 
that some of the questions being asked had already been covered by Anjam / 
myself and Andreas but had somehow not been communicated.

My message was not intended to convey any another impression.  I've also now 
spoken with Anjam & Tanya and clarified this.

regards

Lloyd

Lloyd,

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.  

Vince 

   
	
	

Tanya,

I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - I'll be at MG 
with Andreas today and we'll call you.   Most of these points have already 
been covered with Anjam in any case.  I'm also attaching a file downloaded 
from Mercur (MG's risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions 
for each metal in each entity.  You can fairly easily create tables and graph 
what you want to see.  We can talk today about getting a full deal download.

Hi Andreas,

Here are the issues we would like to discuss on our Thursday meeting in NY:

1. Inputs for options valuation, in particular the origins of volatility 
curves;
2. Information on exotic options structures (existing & potential);
3. The data flow (are we going to get data from London or NY).
4a. Storage of positions information at  MG. How to extract the positions 
info from
MG database into spreadsheets.
4b. Existing positions structure for each metal.
5. Introduction to concentrates trading business, key personnel.

Best Regards,

Tanya & Anjam

Thank you very much for your detailed answer to my question on e-Speak.  I 
find this area of study fascinating and would very much like to learn more.  
It's interesting that you mentioned the Amram/Kulatilaka book because I'm 
reading it right now!  I've talked with my director, Terry Galassini about 
the possibility of taking your classes this fall and it looks good so far.  
And I'd like to take you up on your offer of a set of binders on real options 
and energy industry applications. 
FYI, I'm a senior engineer in a facility planning group up here in Omaha 
although I obtained an MBA from the University of Houston a few years back.   
The concepts of risk/reward and all of the financial tools available to hedge 
risk in financial markets have always tantalized me in their possible 
parallels in the gas industry.   My recent personal discovery of this area of 
real option valuation has further piqued my interest.  

If you could, please add my name as a possible attendee to your fall 
presentations.  Thanks again for your e-Speak dialogue.

Hi everyone,

I have run the model and, along with the contract briefs I have some=20
questions & ideas. I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid=20
writing this detailed, one-sided e-mail, but with our schedules being so=20
exclusive, this will have to do for now.

Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure=20
complexity. So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode=
ls=20
for each contract. However, the JC Penny=01,s version can serve as a testin=
g=20
platform for some of the items I am mentioning below. I have not talked to=
=20
the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model, so=
=20
some of these comments may be mute points. I plan to do that went I get bac=
k.=20

1) Since the credit risk is developed for a time period, it makes sense to=
=20
regularly update the commodity data (and credit rating if its chaged) and=
=20
re-run the model for the time remaining.  I would expect this is done alrea=
dy.

2) The default probabilities seem not to change. That is, if the input cred=
it=20
rating is E1, then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contrac=
t=20
period. For annual accounting that seems OK, but in MTM, it seems to me tha=
t=20
the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating=20
transition probabilities.  That is, the credit implications of companies=20
changing their credit rating during the contract period. with some=20
constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a=
=20
more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world.

3) Are all "defaults" created equal to us? Look at OC. It seems to me that=
=20
the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different=20
business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies. However, we a=
re=20
dealing with specific types of firms where "default" may not mean we do not=
=20
get paid. Sure we still have some credit risk, but it=01,s not like Montgom=
ery=20
Ward=01,s where the lights are being turned off for good. Energy is so=20
fundamental for a company=01,s success and default actions can be used as a=
 way=20
to save a company albeit in a different form.  So financial default does no=
t=20
neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally.

4) A while back someone said to me that may, maybe the people who reach for=
 a=20
life preserver are more likely to live than those that don=01,t. By that I =
mean=20
that, perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th=
e=20
credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to=20
contract EES, then they are more likely to improve that one that doesn=01,t=
.=20
This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesn=01,t consider. Th=
is=20
would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables=
=20
and compare it to their credit rating forward curve.

5) This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special financ=
e=20
team. The contract briefs are, to me, the begimnning of this exercise.  If =
we=20
can combine our customers into "exposure group portfolios" (for lack of a=
=20
better term), where a group has similar "risk characteristics" beyind the=
=20
current parameter set, that we define, then this offers a potential to shop=
=20
some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets.

6) A technical point. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments.=20
Besides the model assumptions, numerical experiments have three inherent=20
error attributes; the number of trials, numerical roundoff, and random numb=
er=20
generator randomness statistical properties. The first two are not a proble=
m=20
in this application but the last one could be. Has anyone examined the effe=
ct=20
of using different random number generators on Enron=01,s aggregate credit =
risk?

7) There is one last point here. For most of the above points, the "improve=
d"=20
analysis could make the credit risk be higher.=20

Rick=20

 July 20th we will celebrate Shirley's birthday therefore I asked her
if she would mind if I ordered lunch for the staff meeting whereby she
can relax during that  time period. (without pressure to get the lunch ready)

On July 20th I would like too  have a different caterer for our lunch ,they 
will basically
serve the same menu with a different style hopefully the group will enjoy
the meal.

The menu will include : assorted sandwiches
                                                         chips
                                                        soup
                                                     Iced Tea

Vince,

Can I loan to Giuseppe my cell phone for the summer?

Stinson

I will be on the call. I may disconnect around 4:00 to attend the traders' 
daily meeting. 
A couple of issues:
1. Would it be possible to get Gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not 
have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in 
his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay.
2. It is getting noisier here. Gappy and I are wandering if we could get 
office space downstairs (that we share). We will maintain presence on 44, but 
we will be able to discuss when needed.

Erin,

A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent
non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most 
important
references to more advanced books and papers.
The book has an endorsement  by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.

The Research Group offered  several one-day seminars on real options
and applications to the energy industry. We still have a few binders with
the presentation materials available if you are interested.
We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall.
The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general 
concept of real options
and their applicability to the energy business.
The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used
to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case
studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired 
power plants).

The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the 
problem of making
investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this 
is a
perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other 
techniques developed
earlier.

Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through
analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, 
optimistic,
pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers
and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.

The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture
uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that
allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to 
downside risk.
This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and 
future
operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options 
that are exercised
in the future through active management of a project.

The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to 
come
up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real 
challenge is
to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30 
years
of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants 
armed with 
powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The 
challenge is not
to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions
but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand 
specific  businesses
into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to 
stress-test the assumptions
of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends 
critically on any set of assumptions.
If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying 
assumptions.
I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the 
dynamics of oil prices,
but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very 
optimistic  upward trend.
One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question 
what Economics 101
teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.

   

Good news!  There is already a question waiting for your July 12 eSpeak 
session.  I have pasted it below, although you don't have to respond until 
the actual event.  Don't forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics 
if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens.

Thanks.

I was doing some reading about the application of real options in the 
evaluation of non-financial assets. Would you recommend any texts or articles 
for a 
more in-depth study of this area? Is quantification of risk or uncertainty 
the major challenge in using this concept? Can statistical tools be used with 
this to do 
a sort of sensitivity analysis?  

Shirley,

Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

Hey Vince,

Thanks for your reply.  I'll see what becomes of the session and keep you
informed.  As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of the
paper I gave you.  We have since found out that by using certainty
equivalence, our model is more robust.  For example, if one has an asset
pricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey and
Siddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean,
variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 1997), our
model allows you to price options under the real world measure.  The
benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical
data that is non-risk neutralized.
   From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in a
mean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky
measure).  However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefit
because we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriate
cite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.  Given we
can only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes much
more significant.
   I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you
have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like
to see it.

Thanks again,

Tom

Attached in the latest version of my real options presentation, which I'll be 
presenting at a Real Options Group conference in Cambridge next month.

I've removed the gas storage pricing example, and instead put in a simple 
example to show that my method can reproduce decision tree approaches (should 
one wish to do so).  This is a response to the heavily decision-tree 
dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.  I 
want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and 
option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option 
valuation.

My presentation now covers:
1. Decision trees.
2. Binomial option pricing trees.
3. Power station valuation.
4. Power asset development.
The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) 
binomial tree method.  I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most 
correct way to do this.

Steve

Tom,

Thanks for your message.

I shall be glad to attend the meeting (of course a lot may happen between

Hello Vince,

A colleague and I are hoping to have a panel discussion on energy
securities for the coming Eastern Finance Association Meetings (April
25-28, 2001 in Charleston, South Carolina).  I was wondering if you or
someone you know at Enron would be interested in participating in such a
meeting.  I realize that you may not be able to plan this far in advance
and would certainly not be offended in the least if you cannot participate.
 We already appreciate you taking time out of your schedule this past
semester to visit LSU.

I hope all is going well and wish you continued success in your ventures,

Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we 
don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a 
self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Vince

Hi Lance,

 he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about 
using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about 
Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if 
you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him 
specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then 
that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then 
interview him.

Vasant

Vasant,

Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the 
summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full 
time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern. 

Lance 
Hi!
   Thank you very much for your help.
Here is my resume.
Please let me know what should I do next as soon as possible.
Becasue I have several interview plans with other companies.
But I would like to work at Enron most.
So if I can get the job at Enron, I don't want to
hang around others.

Thank you again.

Thank you, Vince. 
I understand this tax effect already when you explained it to me in your 
office this morning.
I agree with you that short-selling is not so good, especially for me, 
because I have 
a significant capital loss this year. I definitely don't want to increase my 
capital loss carry over.
(The short-selling idea might work for a person who wants to exercise his 
options and 
already has a huge capital gain this year. Unfortunately, it is not me.)
Thanks again for pointing this out.
The "employee stock option with taxes" problem sounds interesting. I will 
think more about it when I have free time.
-chonawee

Vince J Kaminski@ECT
07/10/2000 01:57 PM
Chonawee,

As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad 
decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to 
$100.  
You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise 
gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes
on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. 

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option 
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have 
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

Vince

Chonawee Supatgiat@ENRON
07/10/2000 11:40 AM
Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It 
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised 
but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call 
option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the 
ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good 
article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)
-chonawee

Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options

In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when 
you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In 
fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never 
reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or 
until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold 
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your 
exercise.

However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of 
exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that 
amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, 
you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On 
the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the 
options to cover your short position anytime. 

Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, 
and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as 
follow

If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, 
you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no 
matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover 
the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of 
short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can 
cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your 
options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still 
keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the 
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your 
short position.

Free Seminar: "Optimization Model for Capital Investment Decisions
Using Option Pricing", by INFORMS President John Birge

You are invited to attend a free, 45-minute online seminar on
"Optimization model for capital investment decisions using option
pricing".

When: Wednesday, July 19, at 2:00 PM EDT

Where: Right from your desktop! You can participate using your office
computer and telephone.

How: <http://www.e-optimization.com/resources/web_realoptions.cfm>

Real-option valuation incorporates the opportunities a company may enjoy
using either new knowledge or changes in the marketplace for making
capital investments. The talk focuses on optimization models for
determining best investment levels and demonstrates how stochastic
(involving random variables) programs consider risk without creating
unwieldy formulations. Hear how Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and General
Motors are using this process successfully.

INFORMS President John Birge, Dean of the McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the Northwestern University in
Illinois, will give the seminar. John is a popular author and speaker
and during the past five years has been in demand for his talks on
stochastic programming and optimization.

Who should attend: OR analysts, strategic planners, financial analysts,
consultants and financial decision makers or anyone interested in
hearing about innovative, exciting, practical decision-making tools.

Shirley,

Here it is.

on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. 

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option 
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have 
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It 
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised 
but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call 
option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the 
ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good 
article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)

Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options

In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when 
you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In 
fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never 
reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or 
until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold 
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your 
exercise.

However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of 
exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that 
amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, 
you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On 
the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the 
options to cover your short position anytime. 

Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, 
and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as 
follow

If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, 
you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no 
matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover 
the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of 
short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can 
cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your 
options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still 
keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the 
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your 
short position.

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you
concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again
this year - brilliant!

I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper
again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your
contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.

To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical")
topics that are already covered:

Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of
Exotic Energy  Contracts

   multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
   adding jumps
   applying the models to  exotic energy options
   extensions to multiple  energy contracts

Les  Clewlow: Valuation and Risk Management of Virtual Power Stations and
Gas  Supply Agreements

   Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA)
   Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS)
   Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's

Combining  Counterparty and Portfolio Credit VaR Techniques

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured
contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

Our PR staff has put together a great design for the Finance Seminar
mugs.  We need to get a clean copy of the Enron logo, if possible.  The
design is in Adobe Pagemaker if your people can find a logo that can be
pulled into that format.  They can send it directly to me and I will make
sure it gets to the right place.

Thanks so much.

European Gas CERA Alert: Signposts to a High Demand Path for Natural Gas: The 
Large Combustion Plant Directive and German Nuclear Phaseout

Abstract 
Two unrelated developments at the end of June both point in the direction of 
a long-term high demand growth path for natural gas in Europe, consistent 
with CERA's Blue Gold scenario. Both the approval of the Large Combustion 
Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German 
nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the 
early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power 
capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by 
natural gas-fired turbines.

particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

Lloyd,

Yes, this would be very useful. I was told that we should not do any official 
business with
MG until July 15. I don't want to violate those rules of engagement and go 
beyond casual contacts.
After the 15th all the stops are off.

Vince

   
	
	

No problem - I do think this could wait until MG are more closely integrated 
in any case.   A useful first step might be an email to relevant trading 
staff at MG outlining briefly what Maureen does and how she can provide a 
service to them.  Would you like me to send her a list of potential people to 
email?

Regards

Lloyd

Lloyd,

I think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead.
I don't see a  justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we 
have an alternative solution.

Vince

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
Monday.

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
meetings to take place?

Regards

Vince:  I very much enjoyed getting to know more about you yesterday
morning.  When do you return from Australia?  I would like to arrange
for you, I, and Tim Luehrman to meet so that you can learn more about he
and his vision and the possibilities laying ahead for PwC and its global
Financial Advisory Services practice.   I briefly talked with Tim and he
very much would enjoy receiving a copy of the publication in which you
referenced his tomato field model.  Can you send it to me by
"attachment" file?  Also, your resume and other info you might provide?
I hope to see you again soon or at least upon your return from
Australia.  Best regards, Al Arfsten

Vince, I know we've run by each other a couple times but I haven't had a real 
chance to talk with you.  I just wanted to let you know how my summer is 
progressing, and it's going well.  I'm sitting on 29 now, with CTG in the 
Coal Group.  I'm always glad to see some familiar faces from Research and 
would love to visit with you.  I'll try to drop by and catch you next week 
sometime, if you're here.

I hope you have a great weekend.  I'm getting together with a group of 
friends this coming Monday and going to see a baseball game at Enron Field on 
the 4th.  It should be fun, even though the Astros will be losing again.

Take care,
Van

Brenda,

What test are we supposed to carry out?
Is Monday next week OK?

Vince

Hello ,

I am on the QA team for the Win2k roll-out.  We need your help in testing 
"ALCAR" in a Windows 2000 environment.

This testing is crucial to the success of converting all PC's from NT4 to 
Windows 2000.  We ask that you make an appointment to come to our offices 
(EB2224B) to preform the test.  It  should not take more than 15 minutes.  
Please e-mail me as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Brenda Cassel

Jana,

Friday, July 28th works for us. We can work out details
closer to the 28th.  If you take  Hardy Toll Road, you will need about 40-45 
minutes
to get to the Woodlands on Friday after 6:00 p.m. I shall send you detailed 
directions
later.

Look forward to seeing you again.

Vince

  The eThink Team
We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

Dale,

Confirmed.

Vince

Vince:

7am at Hyatt Regency Downtown would be perfect. I will see you in the lobby
at 7am.

Best regards, Dale
Dale,

Friday is a bad day (Performance Review Committee all day).
What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

Vince

Vince:

Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That
would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at
about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much
of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient
with me.

sold! I'll initiate the call.

Ed,

Thursday works for  me. What about 10:30  my time?

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

how about Thursday, July 6?

Ed,

A correction. I shall spend an entire day at PRC (performance review)
on Friday, July 7. Can we do on another day

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

I'll still be here in Boston so we'd do it over the phone. OK?

Ed,

Will you be in Houston on that day or we shall do it over the phone?

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

Vince,

How about a pre-meeting web site cruise on Friday, July 7 at 11AM EDT?

July 12, 2:30 it is. I would like the pre-meeting site cruise.
How can we arrange it?

on Friday, July 7 at 11AM EDT?

Ed

Ed,

Wednesday, July 12, 2:300 will work for me.

I shall be glad to review your website --
www.weathereffects.com. I shall invite some
people who work on electricity in
my group to join me.

Vince

Please respond to <ekrapels@esaibos.com>

Vince,

Good to hear from you and I'm glad you're available. How is Wednesday at
2:30?

I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to
say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because
of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman,
Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk
about a shotgun marriage!

If we have time next week, I could step you through our website --
www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art
WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for
PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity
judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the
results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).

Have a great weekend.

Ed

Ed,

I shall be available on both days. What about Wednesday,
July 12, between 1:30 and 4:00. Please, let me know
what time would work for you.

It will be nice to see you again.

Vince

P.S. By the way, did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL?

Please respond to ekrapels@esaibos.com

Dear Vince,

I will be returning to Houston during the  week of July 10.

ESAI and Weather Services International have launched -- after more than 18
months of R&D --  our service, called Energycast Power Trader and Energycast
Gas Trader, for power traders in Nepool and PJM. I would be happy to review
the service with you as well as take you on a tour of our web site. Are you
available on July 12 - 13?

Sincerely,

Ed Krapels

Paul, Raymond,

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics.

Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a

Christy Young is the UT MBA recruiter. She is taking a couple of weeks off to 
get married and will return on July 19th as Christy Meador.  In her absence, 
I wanted to make sure we coordianted our efforts with you. 

Below are a few key UT recruiting dates. Ideally, we would like for your 
presentation to occur a week or so before our interview list is due to the 
Career Services Office. This will allow for additional candidates to submit 
their resumes for our review before we turn in the interview list.

Wed., Sept. 13 - Corporate Presentation & Reception - Alumni Center
Fri., Sept. 22 - Eye's of Texas Career Fair - Campus
Thurs., Sept. 28 - Enron Interview List due to Career Services Office
Wed., Oct. 11 - Pre-interview Reception - selected candidates only
Thurs., Oct. 12 - First Round Interviews
Fri., Oct. 13 - Second Round Interviews
Sat., Oct. 28 - Super Saturday for UT Candidates

Please let me know what works best with your schedule. Note that October 11 
is the same date as our pre-interview reception.

We look forward to working with you on this.

Thanks,
Cindy Justice

Can you guys followup with him to coordinate an Enron reception following a 
presentation that Vince Kaminiski will give during their annual UT 
Foundations of Energy Finance class.  We do want to do this, and of course 
need to coordinate with Vince and your dates on campus to ensure that we have 
no conflicts.

I am not sure if this falls into the Associate or Analyst camp.  You can best 
determine who the appropriate contact should be.  Leave me an e-mail to 
confirm.

Celeste
Celeste,

Greetings.

As you may recall, I am the Director of the Univ. of Texas Center for
Energy Finance (CEFER).  I would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague Vince Kaminski's annual presentation to the UT Foundations
of Energy Finance class which I will be presenting as usual the first half
of the Fall Semester.

Thus, to begin, I wonder whether either the above is your current e-mail
account, and, with the departure of Meryl Barnett (with whom I believe we
coordinated this in the past), whether this is an issue within your scope.

With respect to this reception, I appreciate that there may be other Enron
receptions scheduled for this Fall.  However, if you so choose, I would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an Enron reception
following Vince's presentation.  If you would indeed like to do so, I
suggest we coordinate with Vince the date for the presentation/reception.

Sincerely,
Ehud

My assistant will contact you Wednesday to arrange the interviews.

Dr. Kaminski:
?
I just wanted to touch base and see if I needed to snail mail  a copy of my 
resume or get in touch with anyone else over at Enron.?  
?
The finance department at LSU will be sending out financial  award letters to 
new Ph.D. students before long, and my interning at Enron would  free up some 
additional departmental funds.? In addition, If I will be here  in Baton 
Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?  I am able 
to pursue an internship in large part because of the department's  
cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and 
or  teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been  
told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to  
rock the boat as little as possible.
?
I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I  say 
internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my  
stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by  
Enron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must  be 
followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is  
necessary to move to the next step in that process.
?
I will be in Houston on July 8 & 9 for my wife's  grandmother's 80th 
birthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in  town?on the preceding 
Friday, or following Monday for a visit and/or  interview.? If not, given the 
relatively close proximity between Baton  Rouge and Houston, I would be happy 
to come at another time.
?
Thanks again,
Shane Green

Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.

An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is 
an options calculator.  This would be an interactive tool to teach less 
sophisticated counterparties about options.  We would like to collaborate 
with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using 
the right formulas).  Who should we contact in research for this?

Attached is a mock-up of what we have in mind...

Jim,

I agree with you. It just burns your time and mine. I shall take care of it
when Ravi comes back from vacation.

Vince

Vince,

Ravi never said a word to me and should have closely coordinated with me - 
otherwise he should have used his own name.  I have a problem with Ravi 
acting in that manner.  No one is questioning Shalesh' integrity but the 
Associate Analyst program called me and stated that Shalesh told them that I 
had requested the move.  If he did that he should not have used my name.  I 
am very sensitive to Analysts moving within a rotation.  It has happened to 
me numerous times and I do not appreciate the disruption it can cause.  If 
you need Shalesh for any reason then he will not be moving. 

Regards

Jim

Jim,

Clarification regarding Shalesh' transfer to EBS.

The request to rotate Shalesh out of Research into EBS
came from Ravi Thuraisingham. My understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and I was more than happy to oblige.

Shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and I can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move.

My impression is that Shalesh is doing a very good job and Ravi is very happy
him. I shall be glad to keep him in the Research Group in his current role.

Have a good 4th of July.

Vince

George, John,

We shall notify you about the location.

P.S. Shirley, please add George and John to the list (Grant, Alex, Sevil as

Would you like to take a like at the service (see below).
The meeting is on July 12 at 2:30 (19th floor).

Vince

Vince,

Good to hear from you and I'm glad you're available. How is Wednesday at
2:30?

I did look at EOL and am not surprised to see its quality. I was unable to
say much about it in my Risk Electricity Hedging and Trading report because
of deadline pressures. How is the site doing? I am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that Goldman,
Morgan, BP and Shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours. Talk
about a shotgun marriage!

If we have time next week, I could step you through our website --
www.weathereffects.com. I'm very proud of what we've done. I can't give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password. It's a very ambitious site -- with state-of-the-art
WSI weather (seasonal, 6-10, and day to day) driving a good load model for
PJM and NEPOOL. ESAI contributes oil and gas input price forecasts, capacity
judgments, and "herding" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods. After one month's full-bore effort, I'm pleased with the
results (e.g., we forecast Nepool onpeak to be $43 and it turned out $46).

Have a great weekend.

Ed

Ed,

I shall be available on both days. What about Wednesday,
July 12, between 1:30 and 4:00. Please, let me know
what time would work for you.

It will be nice to see you again.

Vince

P.S. By the way, did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL?

Please respond to ekrapels@esaibos.com

Dear Vince,

I will be returning to Houston during the  week of July 10.

ESAI and Weather Services International have launched -- after more than 18
months of R&D --  our service, called Energycast Power Trader and Energycast
Gas Trader, for power traders in Nepool and PJM. I would be happy to review
the service with you as well as take you on a tour of our web site. Are you
available on July 12 - 13?

Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the
Declaration of Independence?

Five signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before
they died.

Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.

Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army; another had two sons
captured.

Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary

War.

They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
honor.

What kind of men were they?
Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were
farmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well educated. But they
signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty
would be death if they were captured.

Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships
swept from the seas by the British Navy.  He sold his home and properties to

pay his debts, and died in rags.

Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his
family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his
family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty
was his reward.

Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton,
Gwinnett, Heyward, Rutledge, and Middleton.

At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr, noted that the British General
Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.  He quietly
urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and
Nelson died bankrupt.

Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.  The enemy jailed his
wife, and she died within a few months.

John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13
children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to
waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to

find his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died from

exhaustion and a broken heart.

Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.

Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were
not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of means
and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more.  Standing
tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: "For the support of this
declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence,
we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
honor."

They gave you and me a free and independent America.  The history books
never told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War.  We
didn't fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time and we
fought our own government!

Some of us take these liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn't.  So,
take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July holiday and silently
thank these patriots. It's not much to ask for the price they paid.
Remember: freedom is never free!  Patriotism is NOT a sin, and the Fourth of
July has more to it than beer, picnics, and baseball games.
something to think about...

David,

Can you use my MM funds to cover thislast purchase?
I need to request another check from PWJ 
and it takes always time.

Vince

We made the CD purchase for you today.  Don't forget to mail the check.  I
mailed you the receipt from the deposit.  I will call you towards the end of
July and we can discuss your stock option exercise on 8/12.

Thanks for coming by the office yesterday and have a great trip to
Australia.

John,

Very interesting, I would make a point that the generation demand
is highly volatile  and driven to a large extent by weather. Also,
the changes in the structure of gas demand
require development of different types of storage (more peaking storage).

Vince

See my storage story that begins on 1. Plus you might find the issue to be
of interest. I will be doing little occasionally fee pieces for the
Transportation &

you have on my piece or the report would be appreciated.

Hey you guys,

We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
opinion.

This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
(lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.

If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
of the system and what it's worth. 

John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.

I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.

Step 1 - configure system and value it 
Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
- tough....

See what you think?

B.

	John Echols
	06/28/00 05:41 PM
		 
Here is a first rough draft of a "value @ risk" transaction policy.

I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get 
some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.  For example, should we 
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?

I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).

Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.

Dear Vince and Grant,

Please find attached our butchering of your work (only joking...). We've
tied the chapter in with what has gone before and changed some of your
notation so that it is consistent with ours.

Vince; could you please send thru the footnotes referred to in the chapter
at your convenience. Could you also please supply a full reference for
Routledge, Seppi, Spatt (1999).

Grant; I hope you don't mind we've called PDJD just JD (to fit in more with
our work). Please also can you supply the last figure before you disappear!

Do you want us to write the summary?

Many thanks again for all your efforts. It's all looking good.

Best regards.

Chris.

Good Morning, Vince!

This is just a reminder that I will need some sort of technical article for 
the newsletter by the morning of 10 Jul. (since we won't have an issue this 
coming Monday).  I'd like to get a little earlier start and see if we can get 
one or two pieces by then.  What do you think?

Tom,

Greg's phone number is 713 853 5220. He is very difficult to reach
(frequent trips).

You may find this information useful: Greg is a West Point graduate
and spent a few years in the  military, before obtaining an MBA from Stanford.
He is a very dynamic person and a very pragmatic thinker.

I hope you have a great holiday weekend.

Vince

Vince:  Thanks for this message and update on your recent actions to
establish a closer research relationship between Enron and Wharton.  We are
anxious to work with your firm on many fronts and appreciate all that you
and Jeff Shankman are doing to facilitate closure on a number of
initiatives.

The below article is very interesting and reinforces the entrepreneurial
culture of Enron; it also points out one more reason why our faculty is so
interested in collaborating with you and other executives as the company
moves into this new space.

I would like to call Greg Whalley after the 4th of July weekend to establish
contact and begin a dialogue regarding his interest in joining our efforts
as a Corporate Partner. Will you please provide me contact information?

Please let me know if there is any additional information or material you
will need prior to your meeting with Jeff Skilling.  We are anxious to learn
how he responds to your suggestions.

Thanks again for all that you are doing.  Hope you have a great 4th of
July!!

Clayton,

It translates into a credit risk for those on the other side of the hedge.
Many producers have a long history of poor timing of hedges.
I could give you quite a long list. They definitely need a bright
adviser who will tell them the price of gas two years from now.

Vince:

Here's an amazing factoid in today's paper related to the issue of how much 
money you can "make" (sic) by hedging:

...

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy 
Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging. 

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. 

Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as 
result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. "More than 90 
percent" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce 
Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for 
$2.40, he said. 

Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting 
investors' expectations, Connery said. 

"Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that 
dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility," he said. 

...

$2.40??? Are you kidding????

Conrad,

Thanks for your message.

There are 3 papers Enron contributed to the last MEPR.

There is also another paper on electricity I contributed to the "red book" on 
US
power markets, as well as a paper or credit risk management, and a paper
on weather derivatives. All these papers included in other RISK books were 
written by Enron 
employees.

We would like them included as well, if technically possible.

I think that offering other energy related books through our site, in 
addition to MEPR2,
is fine, but I would leave the decision to Dan Diamond, who is responsible 
for the project.

Hi, Vince,

I was told by Molly that she hasn't received the recommendation form from you 
yet.

Since I got admission late from the school, now I am short of time of getting 
I-20 which needs loan approval,
and getting visa status transferred (from H-1 to F-1) which requires I-20 and 
loan approval 
and normally takes around 45 days through INS (Immigration Naturalization 
Service).

Now, I am trying to push every step to speed up the process in order to 
catch up the school opening at beginning of Sept.

I know I just told you this late last week. Nevertheless, I am writing to see
if you can squeeze some time to finish the recommendation form anytime soon. 
It will be a big help.

Thank you very much, Vince.
Have a good day.

Sincerely, 

Li x39635

Gentlemen,

Thankyou for your fine effort. I'll e-mail thru Thurs eve (Sydney time) what
we have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn't toooo
painful) to see if it is OK with you. A couple of quick questions though.

Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
footnotes - can you please resend them?

Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
with different axis?

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.

Greg,

Dale Nesbitt is a consultant who develops pricing models (spot and fwd)
prices for E-commerce sites. He will be in Houston in the beginning of July.
Any interest in meeting him?

Vince:

Thanks for your help in this matter.  I dont want to be a bother to you.  I
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil
and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
available.

I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

Dale

Ed,

I shall be available on both days. What about Wednesday,
July 12, between 1:30 and 4:00. Please, let me know
what time would work for you.

It will be nice to see you again.

Vince

P.S. By the way, did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL?

Dear Vince,

I will be returning to Houston during the  week of July 10.

ESAI and Weather Services International have launched -- after more than 18
months of R&D --  our service, called Energycast Power Trader and Energycast
Gas Trader, for power traders in Nepool and PJM. I would be happy to review
the service with you as well as take you on a tour of our web site. Are you
available on July 12 - 13?

Sincerely,

Ed Krapels

Dale,

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
I shall talk to the head of our B2B unit on Friday this week and
shall remind him about your visit.

I hope he can make a decision at this time whether he is interested
in pursuing this opportunity

Vince

Vince:

I sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
at your offices on July 5 or July 7 in Houston to follow up our earlier
discussions.  I notice I have two email addresses for you, so I am sending
this to both.  I am not sure the earlier transmission got to you.

Would you be available the afternoon of the 5th or the morning of the 7th to
continue our earlier discussions?  Give me an email or phone shout at
650.218.3069.

Thanks

Dale Nesbitt

Tom,

I am sending you the information about our new B2B unit.
I have talked yesterday with Greg Whalley who is heading the new
unit about the E-commerce project at Wharton and recommended that Enron join
this program.

I have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me.

The meeting with Jeff Skilling has been pushed till the 2nd half of July.
I talked to him briefly twice that Jeff Shankman and I want to discuss with
him building a relationship with Wharton. Jeff Shankman is, by the way, a 
great friend of
your institution.

                    mix reshaping energy market: Purchase of MG only a start

                    B2B platforms, writes Hillary Durgin:

604 words
                    By HILLARY DURGIN

                    If Jeffrey Skilling is right, 

                    Enron's acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Enron's president and
                    chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental 
strategy shift at the
                    Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant 
"new economy"
                    player across various industrial markets. 

                    The Dollars 446m acquisition last month of MG, the 
UK-based metals trader,
                    is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated 
new investments the
                    company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to 
build
                    business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as 
logistics, chemicals,
                    agricultural products and pulp & paper. 

                    Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company 
developed in
                    natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale 
commodity markets. He
                    argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only 
become the principal
                    B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those 
industries. 

                    As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce 
platform, EnronOnline,
                    which has changed the way the company does business with 
its customers
                    while significantly increasing sales. 

                    The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural 
gas and power - saw
                    wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 
per cent in the first
                    quarter. 

                    Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar 
energy business into
                    new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the 
competition
                    entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts 
point out Enron has
                    proved it understands markets and how to manage risks 
while becoming the
                    largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of 
gas and power in the
                    US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth. 

                    "It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an 
orderly way," says Ronald
                    Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. "What 
they're doing here is
                    what they've been incredibly successful at doing," he 
adds, noting that Enron
                    posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and 
taxes (ebit) from its
                    wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per 
cent from the
                    previous year. 

                    Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of 
the company's overall
                    income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone 
sees the unit's ebit
                    increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years. 

                    As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is 
standardising
                    contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to 
create markets by
                    entering as a physical player and providing merchant, 
risk management and
                    financial services over the internet. 

                    "We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide 
liquidity and we will
                    provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract," Mr 
Skilling says. "That is an
                    extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites, 
they don't do that." 

                    Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will 
triumph over the other,
                    bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal 
depends on two parties
                    hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, 
price, credit and
                    fulfilment. 

                    Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for 
example, would
                    rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco 
recently purchased a 3
                    per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston- 
based, neutral
                    wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and 
American Electric
                    Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of 
transactions on the
                    site to lend it liquidity. 

                    Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, 
Enron believes it
                    needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring 
MG, Enron got a
                    stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical 
position. 

                    "It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active 
physical spot market
                    in more markets in the world," says Greg Whalley, chief 
executive officer of
                    Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to 
identify and enter
                    commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other 
markets, Enron will
                    deliver better pricing, price risk management services, 
cross-commodity
                    transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range 
of customers. 

                    Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for 
restructuring an industry. 

                    "If you can take that platform, and you use the 
capabilities the bricks bring to
                    the table, e-commerce the industry and change the 
structure, you're selling for
                    more than a 50 multiple."

Jana,

A correction. I am going to spend one week in Australia and I have
just realized that I have to leave on Friday, July the 14th, at night,
to arrive in Sydney on Sunday morning.

Maybe we can meet on Friday the 7th (we would like to invite you
to dinner and then we can have a glass of wine outside, the weather
and mosquitoes permitting).

Alternatively, we can meet during the weekend of July the 29th.

John,

I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and 
elimination of
risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being 
aware of risk
does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.

Now a few more detailed comments.

1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined 
with 
a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,
should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without 
sufficient depth.
One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The 
approach used in valuation
of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of 
investments in physical
assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized 
through other aspects
of valuation technology used in RAROC. 

If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent 
and use
this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that 
I recommend this course of action).

2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.

Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.

He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the 
floor for
the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as 
opposed to taking a vol
risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes 
fuzzy.
The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on 
two factors:

1. risk preference
2. existing portfolio positions

Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that 
consists of two parts:
expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 
standard deviations.
The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability 
to absorb the loss.
I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We 
looked into insurance pricing at the
request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more 
about it.

Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease 
the risk of the overall portfolio.
I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not 
look to me as a deal that reduces risk
(given all our positions in this region).

What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the 
utility function of a decision maker
in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. 

If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,
we should subtract from the value of the contract
the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).
If we don't price this option explicitly,
the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk 
premium.

In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot 
hedge, he should recognize the risk
of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of 
the option.
How big is the discount? See the comments above. 

In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton 
paradigm applies, both values
will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form 
the point of view of 
a seller and a buyer will converge.

3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?

We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will 
recognize the downside and/or
upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of 
NPV as of today.
Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases 
we are still holding
it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is 
equivalent to using a 
discount rate with a risk premium.

I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a 
delay in responding
to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we 
all agree.
It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not 
have
good answers.

Vince,

Would you mind looking this over and suggesting or making any changes you 
feel necessary?  Now that we are past Stinson and Samer's series, I'd like to

Please, let me know if any name is missing.

Grade: A

Thanks a lot. It was a pleasure working with you.

Vince Kaminski

David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download
We=01,re back after a small hiatus, to bring you more white papers
courtesy of Network World. This week we=01,ve got a report on how to
prevent those nasty denial-of-service attacks,  a look at the SunTone
Certified Services for Service Providers program, and a Network World
white paper on network storage issues.

Arrowpoint Communications
Web Site Security and Denial of Service Protection

Preventing a denial-of-service (DOS) attack is critical for most Web
sites. These attacks are specifically designed to bring down a Web site
using methods that appear to be normal network traffic  until it is
too late. Web site administrators have used packet filtering in their
IP routers to provide basic access control, but often this slows router
performance to an unacceptable point and fails to eliminate many common
types of DOS attacks. Furthermore, traditional firewalls were designed
to prevent access to systems, a concept that is incompatible with
today=01,s Web.

With that in mind, Arrowpoint presents its case for Content Smart Web
Switches that provide comprehensive Web site and back-end system
security capabilities, as well as the right level of security, without
sacrificing scalability or performance. The paper looks at the switches
and how they can help prevent the DOS attacks.
http://nww1.com/go/wp062200_arrowpoint.html

Sun Microsystems
SunTone Certified Services for Service Providers

With the explosion of service providers offering Internet services, Sun
created the SunTone certification and logo program to recognize and
promote investments in process, methodology and infrastructure
elements that promote secure, reliable and predictable Internet
services.

This white paper explains the program, shows its objectives, highlights
the certification process and gives an example of a sample certified
architecture.
http://nww1.com/go/wp062200_suntone.html

Network World white paper
Making the Storage Connection

The rising tide of data storage has hit a critical point. Learn more
about the latest network storage solutions by reading case studies of
companies that are tackling the issue. Included is a discussion of
whether to outsource your storage, and a glossary of storage networking
terms.

This white paper was produced by Network World in association with
3Ware, Computer Associates, Exabyte, Interphase, St. Bernard Software,
Storage Networks and W. Quinn.

It makes also sense to ask Paulo every time to say a few words.

Vince,

Thanks for your reply.   That is what I feel too: Vince knows what we are 
doing, so he does not have to ask us again.

In another dimension,  I want to make sure that people like Paulo get enough 
incentive to perform.   The group meeting, I
think, will provide a sense of accomplishment when other members in the group 
know what we have been through.

Thanks again for your understanding.

Sorry if you get this impression. The real reason is that I treat
the lunch meetings as an opportunity to get updates on things
that are going on at more remote locations. I interact with each of the
members of your group daily and I know what's going on.

I agree with you, however, that the lunch meetings are not exclusively
for my benefit,  but also for the benefit of  the other members of
the group. I shall make sure that you have the opportunity
to communicate  your contribution to the company.

Vince and Stinson,

The valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months.  The 
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing.   However, when comes to the
staff meeting (Thursday lunch meeting), we are often left out for updating 
our projects.
This makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth 
mentioning.

I am hoping that we can get  more exposure, despite we are still in the old 
economy.

Zimin

Eric,

Thank you for your message. The only other message in my mailbox
from you is dated 6/11/2000 and contains a reference to a resume I cannot
locate. I checked the log of all the messages and could not find any other
communication from you.

Please, send a message with a resume again and we shall go from there.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

        I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
valuable time.

Warmest Regards,

Dr. Kaminski:
?
I had intended to contact you regarding a position at Enron  this summer, but 
the department really needed me to teach a section of  undergraduate 
corporate finance this summer.? If all goes well,  and?there is a place for 
me at Enron, I would be able to start after the  summer session ends in 
late?July.? 
?
I?discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at Enron with  Drs. Tom Arnold 
and Alex Butler, both of whom send their regards, and they both  felt the 
experience would be invaluable given my research and career  objectives.? Dr. 
Arnold and I agreed that a sabbatical of 1-2 years would  be optimal.? I feel 
that it would be difficult to get a good idea of where  the company is 
headed, and to show how I can be a valuable team member in  helping it get 
there?in much less than a year.? He was afraid that the  university would 
begin to grumble if I was gone for much more than 2  years.? Any suggestions?
?
Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing  from you.

Vlady, I enclosed the file with 2 backtesting plots (you saw them before).

The following table shows what was the percentage of the days when PnL fell 
below VAR95, VAR90, VAR85. 
These results are based on the real NG forward prices from 1/1/99 to 6/7/00 
for 2 different portfolios:
-Portfolio 1 contained the positions equal to NG-PRICE-PRC portfolio 
positions on 6/6/00, 
-Portfolio 2 consists of the positions equal to STORAGE-PRC positions on 
5/25/00.

_____________________________________________________________________
Portfolio 1
     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    2.93  4.11  5.57
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.62  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.97  6.75  12.02  15.54
Historical vols withDecay=0.94  6.45  12.02  15.54
_____________________________________________________________________
Portfolio 2
     VAR95  VAR90  VAR85  
Implied Vols    4.1  6.74  9.97
Historical vols with Decay=1  7.04  11.14  15.84
Historical vols withDecay=0.97  6.74  10.56  16.13
Historical vols withDecay=0.94  7.04  11.14  15.84
____________________________________________________________________
This shows that when we have more observations (columns corresponding to 
VAR90 and VAR85)
compared to the column corresponding to VAR95 the frequency of Curve Shift 
being lower than VAR
becomes closer to the theoretical value (5%, 10% and 15%). The numbers in the 
column "VAR85" are 
very close to 15%. This is the argument in favor of using historical vols. 
And also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment.

Also notice: the numbers in column "VAR95" are higher than 5% and this is an 
indication of fat tails.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Tanya.

John,

It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall 
elaborate on my 
position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).

Vince

   

Vince,

John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and 
potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with 
in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which 
is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which 
discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to 
value these options

First, some additional information.

Option characteristics:
-- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company)
-- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated
-- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or 
Turkish Lire)

We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75 
per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on 
December 15, 2000.  The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) 
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 
$118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due 
to such a large "valuation gap", they originally encouraged us to exercise 
all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early 
Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to "swap" instrinsic value for time value by 
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.

We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to 
use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most 
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's 
historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use 
(although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)

A few key points:
-- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this "to 
be negotiated" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future 
options intrinsic value in 3 years
 (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but 
the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation)
-- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we 
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return
-- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount
-- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we 
obviously do not exercise.

We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able 
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and 
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach 
our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market 
and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing 
that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the 
non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option 
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel 
RAC's approach is double counting.

If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a 
call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.

Regards,
John Bottomley

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001

I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.

Dr. Kaminski:

You probably won't remember my name, but I am the Ph.D.  student that took 
you back to the airport after your visit to Louisiana State  University 
during the previous academic year.
?
I received my M.S. in Finance in May of last year, and chose  to?remain at 
LSU to work on my Ph.D. At that time, I intended to pursue a  career 
in?teaching and research at a four year college or university.?  In 
part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in  normative research, 
my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to  earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to 
pursue a career in research in the private  sector.
?
As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are  designed to train 
future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize  methods to approach the 
types of questions that are of interest to finance  academics.? What did 
surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest  often had little to 
do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners  in the real 
world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic  researchers know 
little about what their counterparts in the private sector  
are?doing.?????????????????????????????????????  
?
In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of  the remainder 
of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the  private sector 
to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to  face as a 
researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve  around the 
use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk  management, 
Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal  place to 
learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the  company 
that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there  are no 
such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give  
me,?such as whether or not you think such a "sabbatical" (for lack of a  
better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for  
Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.?

Ehud,

We shall make  reservations for dinner at Vincent's
on West Dallas (2701 West Dallas, 713 528 4313).
We shall make reservations fro 7:00 p.m.
You can call me on my cell phone (713 410 5396) if there is a problem.

We shall have about 25-30 people at the meeting on Thu at
11:30.

See you tomorrow.

Vince

Vince,

Greetings, and thanks for your 6/12 e-mail.

>We can meet for dinner on the 21st. Then you can visit with us on the 22nd
>in the morning and have individual meetings. At 11:30 you can meet the
>entire
>Research Group at our weekly lunch meeting. We can continue
>individual meetings in the afternoon.
I thank you once again for your invitation and look forward to my visit
this Wed.  My current schedule calls for a Hobby arrival on Wed. at 6:23
p.m., in time for the dinner scheduled for that evening.  (I can take a cab
directly to the restaurant if you're scheduling a circa 6:45 - 7 p.m.
dinner.)  Further, I have tentatively set up the Thur. return flight to
Austin at 3:38 p.m., and that can be modified as desired.

>Please, make a reservation at Hyatt Regency Downtown or Double Tree
>Downtown (there are several hotels with the same names).
When I made the room reservation last Mon. 6/12, it turned out that these
hotels showed no vacancy (is there a conference in town?), so the nearest I
could obtain is the Hilton Houston Plaza (6633 Travis) some 3.5 miles away
from Enron.  (If it is important that I stay at the closer hotels, Shirley
might ascertain whether Enron's travel agent can obtain a room there.)

I take this opportunity to request of Shirley that, subject to your
approval, an overhead projector, screen and small lectern be made available
for the room where the 11:30 luncheon meeting takes place.  Also, since I
would like each participant to have his/her own copy, I would ask her to
advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend, or
alternatively, Shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when I
bring the "master" copy in Thur. morn.

I look forward to seeing you Wed. and Thur.  Best Regards,
Ehud

An interesting piece of information from the oil markets. 
Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down
production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).

The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst).
He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations.
He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in
his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the
oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and 
transparency of
the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by 
Saddam's
government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.

Vince

John,

It seems to me that using a risk-free rate is not appropriate. I shall 
elaborate on my 
position and send you a longer message this afternoon (my time).

ANSWER:  When a company goes public, it
must file a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which regulates the federal
securities laws.  Also, each state has
its own set of regulations - known as
"blue sky laws."  Thus, before a company
can sell stock in particular state, the
securities must be "blue skied."  The origin
of the phrase comes from the late 1800s,
when a judge compared an IPO to the value
of a section of the blue sky.

\-----------------------------------------/

A rash of insiders have filed Form 144 in recent days,
weeks and months, notably co-founder and Chief Financial
Officer Edward Kinsey. On June 6, he filed to sell 90,000
shares valued at $5.0 million, or $55 a share, through
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, lead underwriter of Ariba's
IPO one year ago. May 30 he filed to sell 100,000 shares
for $7 million, and May 18 the Kinsey Family Foundation
filed to sell 14,000 shares for $1.1 million.

Marketing vice president David Rome filed to sell 150,000
shares for $10.5 million on May 30. Robert D. Lent, vice
president for corporate development, filed May 24 to sell
200,000 shares for $14.3 million.

The sales come long after Ariba's price peaked at $183.34
in early March, before the Nasdaq Stock Market plunged amid
the fallout over rising interest rates and concern about
soaring valuations. Back then insiders, who began to sell
immediately after the six-month lock-up on their shares
expired, were reaping far more from their sales: Rome, for
example, indicated in a February 1 filing he would sell
200,000 shares for $35 million.

Business-to-business is regarded as the hottest of the
Internet's hot spots, and Ariba as a leader in its niche.
The insider sales are tiny in comparison with the company's
235.8 million outstanding shares, but they make a dent in
the float -- more than two-thirds of Ariba's stock is owned
by insiders and institutions.

************************************************************
A few notes:

Summary:  See columns F,G, and H
ENE Cash Inflow:  (Henry Hub + Basis at Elba {Lake Ch was left out of the 
analysis, see below}) x Unloaded volumes coming from Qatar, Algeria, & 
Venezuela
ENE Cash Outflow:  Fixed & Escalating COS at Elba + Fixed & O&M Charter Hires 
for the Newbuild & Hoegh Galleon + Variable terminaling costs at Elba + 
Voyage costs on the ships + FOB paid to Qatar, Algeria & Venezuela

Henry Hub Gas Price:  Set to $3.55 through 2003, but then dropped to 
$2.90/MMBtu.  You can customize this column as you choose.

Loaded vs. Unloaded:  Revenues are on loaded volumes, Costs are on unloaded 
volumes.  I had the unloaded / loaded percentage for both Newbuild and Hoegh 
for both Algeria & Qatar.  I didn't have them for Venezuela so I just 
extrapolated based on the number of days it took to go round trip. Galleon To 
come up with unloaded volumes, I just multiplied the percentage (unloaded / 
loaded) by the loaded volume.  

Lake Charles:  I started to include this in the analysis, but in the end, 
left it out... I don't think we need it unless we want to model spot cargoes 
pre-Elba (pre-4/1/02) in the future.   Adding it doubled the complexity of 
everything.  So, for all practical purposes, it doesn't impact the analysis 
at all -- you'll see that all the Lake Ch costs are zero.

Ship Usage:  I know you told me to run 50% coming from Algeria, 50% coming 
from Qatar.  However, you can get more volumes to Elba if you take 7.6 
cargoes/yr from Qatar (running the Hoegh Galleon to its max) and 13.9 
cargoes/yr from Algeria (not the full capacity of the Newbuild, but the max 
of the Elba terminal capacity).  Thus, this is how it's been modeled.  
However, you won't see the volumes on the Newbuild until 1/1/03 (when the 
charter starts? -- this is changeable in cell M26 {when you start shipping 
volumes from Algeria to Elba via NB} and both AC25 and AD25 {when you start 
incurring charter costs for the NB}).  Regarding shipping from Venezuela, you 
could either run the volumes from Venezuela using the Newbuild or the Hoegh 
Galleon.  I chose the Newbuild b/c its voyage costs were cheaper.  The fixed 
costs are there regardless of which ship you choose.

Shipping Voyage Costs:  The voyage costs in $/MMBtu are calculated from the 
voyages from Algeria (for the Newbuild) and Qatar (for the Hoegh Galleon) to 
Elba.  The Newbuild voyage costs should drop on 1/1/04 when the volumes start 
coming from Venezuela (rather than Algeria), but they aren't currently 
modeled that way.

FOB to Qatar/Algeria/VZ:  This got a little complicated so I just plugged in 
some fixed numbers.  $1.00/MMBtu to both Qatar and Algeria, $2.30/MMBtu to 
Venezuela.

NPV Calcs:  I've done some, but delete them if you wish.

Good Morning,

I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron.  Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
experience.  I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.

I mentioned a couple web sites and don't know if they came through clearly on
the phone with my sore throat.

Teresa,

I would like to invite Iris for an interview in Houston.
She works currently in London Can you call her
and ask when she is planning to visit the States.
We could pay the airfare from a location in the States.

I would hate to pay the 1st class ticket from London to Houston,
though I would go for it, if necessary (I don't
want a candidate to think that we are that cheap).
Business class is a standard
for business related, cross-Atlantic flights. 

I would be more comfortable if you could negotiate this issue.

Thanks

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more

Dale,

Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings.
It seems things are going well with the Research Group in
London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.

I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I don't think, however,
that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural
leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.

Vince

Dale Surbey
06/15/2000 02:28 AM
Vince,

We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.  Here's 
how everyone came out:

Steven - Superior:  No controversy here.  Steve received consistently strong 
feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).  The 
only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and 
himself.

Anjam - Excellent:  Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all 
categories.  Several reviewers commented that Anjam's performance in the 
areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have 
improved.  I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on 
this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I don't rate him high 
enough to run the group here.

Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjam's performance:  
"Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract 
from his overall performance".

On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short 
notice, so I suspect he's interviewing for a new job.  Given his inability to 
work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group), 
this may be the best long-term solution.  Any thoughts?  

Ben - Superior:  Another non-controversial ranking.  Ben received 
consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the 
area of non-technical skills.

I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.  Even though he was 
promoted at year end, he's taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee 
and helping manage the other quant resources in Brian's group.  Also, since 
Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is 
appropriate since he's effectively her supervisor.

Kirstee - Strong:  Only limited feedback in the 2 months she's been here.  
High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the "soft" skills.  I think 
the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a 
target for improvement for the rest of the year.

- Dale

Thanks for attending. I was on "vacation" last week (driving from Ca to 
Houston)
and could not answer your first message regardoing Insead conference in time.

The objective was to find out more about the he Workshop on High-tech 
acquisitions 
and evaluate the usefulness of the program for Enron. I shall be making a 
recommendation
to Jeff Skilling that we should work with Wharton as a partner in a number of
different research projects.

I shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation 
of  small high-tech firms.

Vince

Benjamin Parsons

I attended the Workshop on High-tech acquisitions at Insead on Saturday 
alongside participants from Cisco, EADS, Razorfish and Cable+Wireless, and 
academics from Insead and Wharton. The basic premise was to discuss and get 
feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which 
is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting - 
especially as this was my first exposure to this area. 

Examples of the discussions raised include
why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-house
what degree of post-acquisition integration was optimal
difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companies
how to value small high-tech firms
how to quantify the success/failure of an acquisition

My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to 
Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give 
us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from 
the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and 
having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our 
realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such 
studies.

Regards

Ben

Ginger & Cheryl,

I will attend.

P.S. Shirley, please put it on my schedule.

Hi Vince,
As we discussed last week here is the VaR doc that I had originally started 
at Xmas and has since been expanded with Stig's and Tanya's help.

We  would be very grateful for your comments.
Cheers
Kirstee

Vince:

Thanks for your help in this matter.  I dont want to be a bother to you.  I
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil
and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
available.

I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

Dale

Dale,

I have passed on the information you gave me but you have to realize that
I acted just as a go-between. I shall be glad to remind our new business
unit
about your proposal. I have already asked a few times.

I shall be traveling this week, Wed - Fri. I shall be back in the office on
Monday.

Vince

Vince:

Just wanted to make sure you know we are still vitally interested in
getting
together with you and the key Enron people.  Thanks so much for all your
help.  I understand how busy you and the new person are, but I hope you are
interested enough to find a slot for us.  I think it will benefit you as
well as us.

Vince

Vince - Thanks for the update.  I've been pulled into a 7:00 am breakfast
which I must attend.  Chances are I could catch up with everyone between
8:00 and 8:15.  I apologize, but  two of my breakfast dates are taking
special flights in just for the breakfast - or I wouldn't inconvenience
everyone.

Steve,

This looks fine. I think we are meeting at 7:45 a.m. on the 14th
next to the general reception area.

Dale,

I have passed on the information you gave me but you have to realize that
I acted just as a go-between. I shall be glad to remind our new business unit
about your proposal. I have already asked a few times.

I shall be traveling this week, Wed - Fri. I shall be back in the office on 
Monday.

Vince

Vince:

Just wanted to make sure you know we are still vitally interested in getting
together with you and the key Enron people.  Thanks so much for all your
help.  I understand how busy you and the new person are, but I hope you are
interested enough to find a slot for us.  I think it will benefit you as
well as us.

You have any time on your schedule on Wed.  I'm in town

http://www.acmc.uq.edu.au/~gwd/EnergyExchange.html

Chris,

We shall try to call you around 5:00 p.m. our time on Monday.
What is the best phone number we can use to reach you?

Vince

Bryan,

I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from 
Ben.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to 
the Wharton School
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or 
more  research projects
with them.

One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a 
symposium in Paris on June 10
 on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you
(or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to 
evaluate the usefulness
of this project.

I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.

Vince

tomczyk@wharton.upenn.edu (Michael Tomczyk) on 05/18/2000 10:56:08 AM
Vincent,

It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and I
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,
agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at
Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any
questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or
you can call him at 215-898-1231.

This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that
Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved
as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership "benefits."

Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:

Friday, September 8
"WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?"
This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.
We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.
Major issues addresses include "New Economics of the Web" and
"Internet, Anywhere."

Friday, October 20
"FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES"
Designed by the ET core group and
presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging
Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join
the program.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in Paris on June 10 to "test drive" the program.

I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program
would be of value.

Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.

best regards,
Michael

Chris,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to meet you and your family in 
Sydney at your home.

I am enclosing the draft of my part of the chapter. It's more than 
preliminary  but I hope
to improve it greatly over the weekend. I shall forward you a new version on 
Sunday evening
my time. Grant is moving along on his part. I  hope it reduces the penalty to 
broken knee-caps.

I shall send you a longer message from home to give you an update on my 
conversations
with EPRM  regarding the articles.

Vince

Hi Vince,
?
Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are  making their way up to 
Houston to visit with you and Grant.
?
I was reading the promotional material for the EPRM  conference here in July. 
I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the  evening between the 
main conference and the post-conference seminars (18th  July). We have a 
pretty spectacular view of the Harbour here that you might  enjoy.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in

brilliant!
?

would me more than happy if you could join us again.

speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that 
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility

be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has 
not been covered  yet.

Would you like to attend the presentation and join me for lunch
with WEFA.

Any other suggestions re attendance.

Please, let Shirley know.

Dear Vince
Thanks for your voicemail and delighted to have you confirm lunch on May 1.
Kemm Farney the head of WEFA's Electric Power services will be travelling
with me this time. I expect there may be other ENRON colleagues that may
care to join us for lunch so don't hesitate to invite as you see fit. For
reservations purposes, perhaps you arrange to let me know numbers.

Kemm would also be prepared to informally present our current power outlook
to a larger group at 11:00, if this would be of interest.

As you know, these types of presentations are part of all your WEFA Energy
Retainer Package. I will also plan to update you with respect to our current

Who should I speak to about making a booking, or is West U open to anyone who 
just shows up to play volleyball there? As for the lunch, is there a 
particular catering service or restaurant we order from? Would Shirley be

The message below relates to a volleyball tournament that will be held at the 
end of the month. If you are interested in being part of a Research Group 
team, please let me know ASAP, so that we could form a team and even practice 
(!?) a time or two. I am told that most of the teams entered are in the 
"social" category - we would be going to have fun, not a serious competition! 
Please note also that the teams entered must be coed, so we need Ladies as 
well as Gents.

Thanks,

Hi Paula,

Thanks for the invitation. I have already accepted an invitation 
from my neighbors. I shall stop by to deliver the card (or maybe I should
wait till it covers the next graduation).

Vince

Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Vince 

James L Bouillion
04/11/2001 06:52 AM
Vince, what feedback should I give Willis on their CHARM product?
James L Bouillion
04/11/2001 06:50 AM
No word yet.  I will follow up with the attendees.

Thanks for taking thje time to make the presentation.

Jim,

Any feed-back on our meeting ? We certainly appreciated the opportunity and
the fact that the meeting was very interactive.

Regards,

Bertil

and we have to close a few loops internally.

Hi Vince:

Just a short note to indicate that we have not heard received any information

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is 
moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I 
met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up 
a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so 
that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during 
the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me 
this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so 
that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look 
forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff 
meeting.

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio.
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
calculated with
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

     1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5%
different from the correct number).
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio
until we have proper methods implemented.

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

 Sevil's primary project has been the Generation Bidding Analysis for the 
East Power Desk.  She worked closely with the Power Fundamentals group and 
the IT group in collecting and organizing the data, and then developing the 
analysis.  Sha has focused on the PJM area and plans to expand the analysis 
to other regions in the East.
 Sevil has also investigated the issue of Risk Premia in Power Prices

I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed working with Enron on the Tiger
Project.  I found the interaction with you and your colleagues very
stimulating.  The ideas we covered (like whether there are network
externalities in these markets) was more like a workshop than a project.  I
wish all businessmen had your interests and capabilities.

I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a "panel" that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

Martin,

Let me read it Friday. We run our papers by our PR
department to review for any potential conflict with the company line.
I shall fwd it to them.

I think you should submit it as an Enron employee with a note
that it was developed when you were at UT.

Vince

My supervising professors from UT and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that 
is based on work done for my PhD.  All of the research was done while I was a 
grad student.  I have a couple of questions regarding submission of this 
paper (to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems).

1.  Should I submit it with my affiliation as The University of Texas at 
Austin or as Enron (ENA, Corp, etc)?

2.  What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?

A draft of the paper for your review is attached.

Thanks,
Martin

Michael,

Thanks. I should  be interested in the materials from the meeting.

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.

A nice introductory & comprehensive report on WD's. FYI.
Krishna.
As part of "Options and other derivates" class I am taking at UH, I had to 
submit a report on either "Weather Derivaties" or "Asian Options" as part of 
individual term project. I choose "Weather Derivatives" and for what it is 
worth, I am attaching a copy of that report for those individuals who are 
interested in "Weather Derivatives".  

Note that in the employee meeting, there was mention of using weather 
derivatives to manage our volumetric risk

Hi Vince and Ken!

Thanks for the opportunity to meet the Rice ALP students--Great group!!!

Regarding the meeting with Steve Kean,  this week looks tough, but I'm trying 
for a few minutes this afternoon to at least say "hello"--if it happens at 
all, it will be at 3:30 or 5p today.  I'll let you know Immediately when I 
can confirm.  Then, we can schedule something for next week when the students 
can have a more thorough discussion with Steve.

Thanks!!

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio. 
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and 
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses 
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% 
calculated with 
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

 1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity 
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to 
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for 
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5% 
different from the correct number). 
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio 
until we have proper methods implemented. 

Tanya Tamarchenko
02/28/2001 01:17 PM
Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Vince,

I'm glad you liked it.  My next "Enron" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?

See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).

Your friend,

John

Hi Vince,

It was a pleasure meeting you during your visit to London.  I hope that all 
is well with you.  Steve, Sharad, Slava and myself sat down today with my PhD 
supervisor to more or less concrete what my thesis will be based on.  To 
start off, I will be working on a price process for power that is tied to the 
stack model.  I imagine that later on we will be pricing power derivatives 
off of this or modifications of it.  Steve has recommended a good paper  - 
"Pricing Power Derivatives" by Geman and Eydeland.  I will be implementing 
their model as that would be a very good departure for me and might also 
prove to be useful to Enron.  The only unfortunate thing is that we are 
unable to locate the paper.  With this in mind, I thought that you might have 
a copy readily available.  Steve and I will continue to look but any 
assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance and take care.

Best regards,

Marcus

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,

FYI.

Tanya has been very helpful recently in helping us to understand the Enron 
VAR modeling system.  So when I received this Henwood report yesterday, I 
immediately thought that this was an opportunity to reciprocate.  (I have 
been hoping to develop some software tools that I think you could use, but 
... you know the drill.)  Although there should be no problem from Henwood's 
standpoint with sharing this document with you, I would prefer that you not 
pass it around outside of Research.

The PGE Generation & Engineering Services department paid for our one-year 
subscription to Henwood's off-the-shelf market forecast.  They wanted a 
broader perspective of the market, given their interest in building power 
plants.  I was not surprised to see, however, that Henwood's 20-year price 
forecast almost lies directly on top of the one that I prepare for PGE.  
Henwood is slightly more bullish on gas prices and seems to be assuming 
greater efficiencies of new generation.  The implied market heatrate, 
however, effectively nets out much of the gas price assumption, and it 
matches our own projections very well.

Be sure to save this and open it outside Lotus Notes or whatever mail system 
you have now.  It is rather large and could lock up your mail.

Are you aware of any subscriptions or contracts that Enron has with Henwood?  
Does London still use their model?  I will be attending a Henwood 
presentation on this report tomorrow in Seattle.  Are you interested in what 
I bring back?

Best Regards,
M

Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed 
distribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe 
contract.

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an 
economic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not 
exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

Korea:

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's 
currency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since 
January.

Brazil:

Argentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in 
January. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.

Thoughts and comments welcome.

Vasant,

I have approved Iris' request for SPSS (reluctantly).
It makes sense for her to use SPSS when she works 
for London (it would require more effort
to move data bet the systems than the cost
of SPSS).

I don't like proliferation of systems, however.

Hi Vince,

 is it fine to approve SPSS for Iris (cost $499), or should we ask that she 
use SAS, for which we already have a site license?  The only reason to use 
SPSS is because I think London people use it (I am not sure about this).

now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North=

America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers=20
Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local=20
community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of=

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice 
to help you with

our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.

Mike 

FYI

Vince

Vince,

I just wanted to follow-up with you regarding the action items that were 
taken away from yesterday's meeting with you, Mike Roberts, Norma, and myself.

1)  Tony Hamilton
As you know Tony's official start date was March 12, 2001, and he has yet to 
receive a paycheck.  London's pay cycles are different than ours however, and 
they only get paid on the 20th of each month.  Tony did not receive a 
paycheck on March 20th because all of his new hire information has to be put 
into SAP (the payroll system) by the first of the month for the employee to 
receive a check on the 20th.  Consequently, Tony will not receive his first 
paycheck until April 20th.  If you would like for me to try and work with the 
London office however and try to get him a paycheck quicker than that, please 
let me know.

2)  Joe Carson
From what I am able to gather, Gary Hickerson did make Joe Carson an offer 
that consisted of a one-year contract.  However, Gary is out of town until 
Monday, and no one is sure of the specifics of the deal.  Would you like me 
to contace Joe to find out the specifics, or would it be more acceptable for 
me to wait until Gary returns so that I can get all of the facts.

I look forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'

Shirley,

FYI -- Bhala is planning to start 5/28

--Stinson

Stinson:   Just a friendly reminder about the job description for Bhala.  He 
called us today, and is becoming somewhat apprehensive about time.   He said 
that you need only provide 3-4 lines of a job description, and that it's not 
necessary to go into any real depth.   Bhala also wanted to confirm a start 
date of 5/28/01 so that he can give notice at his apartment.

Thanks,

Hi Vince,

I'm sorry you weren't around in Sydney this week.  You missed a very good 
book launch party that John Martin organised here for us.  Paul made a short 
speech in which he relayed some great comments which he said  came from?you - 
thanks very much!

Please find attached the next EPRM article. Its not  really tided up fully 
from our end yet, but I wanted to send it off before the  weekend in case you 
got chance to look at it. Because of the Easter break Robin  is after it by 
Thursday of next week.

Martin,

Let me read it Friday. We run our papers by our PR
department to review for any potential conflict with the company line.
I shall fwd it to them.

I think you should submit it as an Enron employee with a note
that it was developed when you were at UT.

Vince

My supervising professors from UT and I are finishing a paper (finally!) that 
is based on work done for my PhD.  All of the research was done while I was a 
grad student.  I have a couple of questions regarding submission of this 
paper (to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems).

1.  Should I submit it with my affiliation as The University of Texas at 
Austin or as Enron (ENA, Corp, etc)?

2.  What legal or other reviews/clearances would I need?

A draft of the paper for your review is attached.

Thanks,
Martin

John, 

I haven't had much time to put something together on this issue.  
Fundamentally both instruments represent the same credit risk, i.e. same 
credit events and contingent payments, both represent senior unsecured credit 
risk.  The differences in pricing therefore arise purely from supply and 
demand.  One would expect generally that the asset swap would be lower than 
the CDS because of liquidity:  there are only so many bonds out there, and so 
demand for Asset swaps is limited.  I am attaching a one page note by JP 
morgan where they claim that one of the principal reasons for the CDS to be 
more expensive is people hedging convertible bonds by combining  (1) a call 
option on the equity and (2) a CDS.  If the call is cheap they will be 
willing to pay more for the CDS, driving the price up.  I'll try to 
synthesize something more complete next week.

Cheers

Martin

Chris,

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather 
group.

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense 
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to 
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London 
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

Vince

Chris Mahoney

Tony was hired to work for Global Markets.   Think costs should be assigned 
to Vince or Mark but if you
believe those costs should be for my group let me know. 

Tani Nath
05/04/2001 09:33
I now have Tony on one of my RCs (research).  I understand he will be doing 
weather forecasts for some or all of you, and that he has a desk allocated in 
Global.  I need to recharge his costs  - can someone please advise the right 
cost centre.

Many thanks,

Tani

Beth,
 
I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  
National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, 
Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling 
and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries 
on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
 
I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in 
this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying 
critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also 
may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of 
agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  
are impossible to view with over approaches.
 
I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business 
groups under separate  transmission.

Hello,

I am enrolled in a Maritime Management Masters program at Maine
Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine and am currently studying "Global
Risk Management and Insurance" as one of my courses. As part of
my research for a term paper I am investigating organizations
in the oil business to see whether or not they have formalized a {Risk
Management Policy Statement}. Does Enron have such a policy
statement and if so would I be able to acquire and incorporate
it into my research paper. If available, I would appreciate some info
on how Enron is involved in Risk Management.

Brgds,
Jim Parsons, MM., BMS.

Hi Ben,

Thanks for your email.

I will take a look at the information you forwarded to me.

What type of "product" is Professor Duffie expecting - an annotated 
bibliography and/or some analysis with a comparative study of the models,

Dear Vince:

I was referred by Rita Hartfield of EBS. I am the Director of Marketing for 
the Digital Content Services Team (David Cox, Frank Bay, et. al.). We are 
identifying and evaluating features and functions that will be a part of the 
next generation Entertainment on Demand (EoD) product.

The e-mail I've excerpted below contains two links to a company that offers a 
"preferencing" service that we know is quite popular and important to 
entertainment consumers. I have some questions abouts the statistics, 
sampling methodology, explained variance etc. of the model that The 
StyleLogic group employs.

Do you have a member of your team that could assist on this project? 

Thanks for your help,

Hi Vince!

I got those notes. They should indeed
be useful. The one from Deutsche Bank
is especially helpful!

I am suppose to know this stuff, as I teach it!

Sorry about the delayed billing.
I have had trouble getting a bill
from my excellent asistant, Taichi Hoshino,
who has returned to Goldman Tokyo,
and has not been able to get anything else
done lately. I will try to get something out soon!

We had several energy people,
from several companies, at our credit risk
exec ed course last month. Seems that
credit risk and  power risk go
together these days!

Warm regards, Darrell

Hi Stinson,

     A colleague of mine - Professor Nalin Kulatilaka of Boston University - 
is interested in visiting Enron to give a talk on work he is doing in the 
broadband area.

     Please see the forwarded emails for further information and available 
dates.

     Can you let me know if we can give him a forum at one of our Thursday 
Research lunches or a Friday brown bag lunch?

Thanks,

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and

best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

The phone number for Ken Lay is (713) 853-6773.
My recommendation is to call Mark Palmer first and discuss the book
with him. His recommendation will open the door. I shall mention this to him
as well. Mark's phone number is   (713) 853-4738.

Vince,

one of my colleagues here at Baylor is writing a book about "the business
of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders.  Bob Darden
is his name and he's a former journalist and nice guy.  He would like to
contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.  Do you think this is
possible?  If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might
use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?

If this is in any way "not ok" please just say so.

See ya,

John

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

"Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, "Ivy Ghose" <ghosei@rice.edu>, 
"Luigi Calabrese" <luigical@rice.edu>, "Pravas Sud" <pravas@rice.edu>, "Syed 
\(Farhan\) Iqbal" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

ken

Dave,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to join you at the dinner 
and on Saturday.
I shall come alone: my wife will stay with my son in California
till June (my son graduates this spring from college).

I shall remind Andy Fastow about NFCF.

Vince,

I'm glad you liked it.  My next "Enron" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?

See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).

Your friend,

John

Hi Vince,
As we discussed last week here is the VaR doc that I had originally started 
at Xmas and has since been expanded with Stig's and Tanya's help.

We  would be very grateful for your comments.
Cheers

Jeff,

I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 
30 minutes
to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.
A separate message about  this visit will follow.

I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships 
with
different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of
the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our 
presence
on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.

We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get 
the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we 
are not
very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses
and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:

1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently  
underwriting two research
projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor  
Nicholas Bambos
(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation
of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.
Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain 
access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and 
also to lock-up some very
promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such 
programs.

2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every 
presentation
I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes 
and hiring decisions.
It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic 
program. In many cases,
the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach 
them during their 
senior years.

3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. 

Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to 
getting the best students
and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important 
in shaping public  opinion
on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of 
deregulation and design of new markets).

Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on 
personal commitment of a number
of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and 
focus.

I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) 
responsible for coordinating
our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from 
our Analyst/Associate
program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.

Vince

Dear Mr. Fujita,

Title: US Gas Markets Reach New Heights: Where Will It Stop?
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1221 ,

The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to between $4.30 and 
$4.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu)--up from less than $3.00 per 
MMBtu in April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of 
supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas 
demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met 
through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running 
between 1.5 and 2.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day below last year's pace.

The weak injection rate so far this season reinforces the pressure--last 
week's injections of only 8.0 Bcf per day compare with last May's injections 
of over 10.0 Bcf per day. If this trend were to continue throughout the 
summer, gas inventory levels would not meet minimum acceptable levels for 
next winter's heating season, which CERA believes to be between 2.65 and 2.7 
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of working gas in storage by October 31. Indeed, 
injections for June to October must ramp up to an average of 8.1 Bcf per day, 
0.4 Bcf per day higher than last year's rate, for inventories to approach 2.7 
Tcf, a level that still exposes the market to shortage late next winter. Even 
reaching this level will be a challenge and will require that demand be 
priced out of the market. This growing realization has sent the market into a 
panic.

Although the forces that have pushed the gas market to this level are not a 
surprise--indeed they have been building for over a year--the resulting price 
level is shocking nonetheless. It highlights the challenge of pushing prices 
high enough to choke off demand and to free gas supplies for storage. Unlike 
years past, the gas market pressures this year come at a time when there is 
little flexibility in energy markets overall. Indeed, power markets are 
headed into the peak summer months with generation capacity still largely 
constrained in most markets; this is likely to result in a higher incremental 
call on gas than ever before--with only limited ability to switch to 
alternative fuels. At the same time oil prices remain above $30 per barrel, 
making the cost of switching particularly high. All these forces combine to 
suggest that the current market pressure is far from an aberration--and it 
raises the question: "Where will it stop?"

There are breaking points in the market that are currently being tested--many 
of them involving industrial and feedstock uses of gas. Few of these 
currently cost below $4.00 per MMBtu, and many are currently above $5.00 per 
MMBtu. How high prices go and how long they stay there depends very much on 
the strength of the underlying market pressures. We expect to see the 
following reactions:

* Power generation: incremental gas-to-residual fuel oil switching. The 
Atlantic Coast dual-fuel market is already providing the first demand 
response to higher prices. Given the late May climb in gas prices relative to 
residual fuel oil prices, a significant portion of the 1.5 Bcf per day 
dual-fuel market has switched from burning gas earlier in the month to 
burning residual fuel oil. This summer, CERA expects virtually all 
logistically and environmentally feasible dual-coal load to burn residual 
fuel oil. This will result in an incremental 600 million cubic feet (MMcf) 
per day loss of gas demand from these plants relative to last summer (and 
relative to early May). However, to keep that load burning residual fuel oil, 
gas prices will have to sustain premiums of $0.05 to $0.25 per MMBtu above 1% 
residual fuel oil prices at New York Harbor to price out switchable capacity 
in the Northeast. Premiums to Gulf Coast residual fuel oil will be required 
to price out Florida and Mis!
sissippi/Alabama switchable capacity. Despite this fuel switching activity, 
CERA expects overall gas demand for power generation to climb by 3.0 Bcf per 
day from May into June as overall power demand increases.

* Reductions in ammonia production. CERA expects a loss in gas demand for 
ammonia production, even with the recent strength in ammonia pricing. Ammonia 
prices have softened somewhat from their highest levels of a few weeks ago, 
but were still at $165 per short ton over the past week. At these price 
levels, US ammonia margins began to disappear as gas moved above $4.00 per 
MMBtu at the Henry Hub. Given the strong gas prices, CERA expects a sustained 
period of negative ammonia margins. Last summer when ammonia margins 
disappeared, a sizeable portion of the North American ammonia production 
capacity closed; at its most extreme in August, gas demand for ammonia was 
down by 0.4 Bcf per day. This demand reduction is likely to be repeated for 
much of this summer. The closing of ammonia capacity should lend some support 
to ammonia prices. Last summer in response to ammonia closures, ammonia 
prices climbed by about $15 per short ton. This feedback effect would keep a 
tight balance on!
 price. For example, raising the ammonia price to $180 per short ton allows 
the industry on average to maintain a margin until the Henry Hub price 
reaches $4.50 per MMBtu. There are limits, of course. Ultimately, high gas 
prices will not shutter the entire domestic ammonia industry, which uses 
approximately 1.6 Bcf per day in fuel and feedstock.

* Ethane rejection. In previous gas price spikes or periods of low oil 
prices, processors have elected to leave ethane in the gas stream, providing 
an incremental source of gas supply. The observed difference in ethane 
production levels in recent years demonstrates a flexibility to add 
approximately 600 MMcf per day of gas supply, should extracting ethane from 
the gas stream become clearly unprofitable. Strength in oil and products 
markets this year, however, makes such an addition to gas supply highly 
unlikely. Last week (May 22-26) Mont Belvieu ethane priced above $5.50 per 
MMBtu (over $0.36 per gallon), with propane pricing over $0.54 per gallon. 
Given these products prices, gas prices of $5.00 in the Gulf Coast and $4.25 
in the Rockies would be required before processors leave significant 
quantities of ethane in the gas stream. In addition, propane, the major 
alternate to ethane in the petrochemical sector, is currently in short 
supply. The result is that until world oil!
 markets loosen, allowing imports of propane, ethane is likely to follow gas 
upward, should gas even reach the ethane price. Unless gas prices rise 
significantly from current levels, or until oil markets themselves weaken, 
CERA does not expect ethane rejection to add much to gas supply this summer.

* Methanol. Methanol margins are also suffering with current gas prices, even 
given recent healthy methanol prices. Methanol prices are being supported by 
the return of Asian demand; specific plant outages, including several ammonia 
feeder plants in Trinidad; and the late startup of several world-scale 
methanol plants, including plants in Trinidad, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. 
Although recent spot methanol prices have risen well above $0.60 per gallon, 
contract prices in the $0.50 range would imply production shutdowns when gas 
prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu. A significant portion of methanol plants 
having already shut down last summer, only a small incremental amount of gas 
demand is expected to be lost with further shutdowns in methanol production, 
perhaps 0.1 Bcf per day.

* Fuel switching to distillate. With distillate prices well above $5.00 per 
MMBtu, distillate is not expected to provide a major source of demand relief 
unless the pressure intensifies extensively and prices spike further. For 
next winter, however, fuel switching to distillate could become an important 
force taking the pressure off gas markets--particularly on the East Coast. 
That said, distillate inventories are currently low. To the extent this 
continues through the end of the year, it would set up a repeat of what 
occurred last winter in the Northeast when prices in both distillate and gas 
markets spiked.

In total there is certainly the potential to provide well in excess of 2.0 
Bcf per day of cushion through a combination of reduced consumption and some 
localized ethane rejection in the Rockies and eastern Gulf--plus a marginal 
increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports (up to 0.1 MMcf per day). But 
currently such a reduction in consumption would require an even greater 
increase in prices. For now the gas market appears to have reached a very 
tenuous resistance point in the $4.25-$4.50 per MMBtu range--a level that 
should result in "choking off" an incremental 0.8 to 1.1 Bcf per day of gas 
demand (relative to two weeks ago) from the combination of additional fuel 
switching to residual fuel oil and reduced feedstock demand for gas (see 
Table 1). However, as we move through June and into July even slightly 
warmer-than-normal temperatures could add an additional 1.0 Bcf per day of 
highly inelastic demand for power generation (relative to normal weather) and 
force prices ev!
en higher to balance the market. CERA estimates that it would take prices in 
the $5.00 to $5.25 per MMBtu range to rationalize this extra 
demand--principally through a combination of ethane rejection and additional 
reductions in feedstock demand for gas. This deep a reduction inevitably 
would force price reactions in petrochemical markets--pushing gas prices up 
even further.

There are also limited forces that could drive the market lower--and remove 
some of the panic. Mild temperatures through June would provide the most 
significant impact by allowing more breathing room for storage injections. 
Any movement by OPEC to increase crude oil output could also help lower the 
fuel switching threshold points. But even if both these forces were to act, 
we estimate this would move gas prices back down only into the $3.50 to $4.00 
per MMBtu range. If prices fell any lower, demand would surge from a return 
of feedstock demand and fuel switching back to gas. For these reasons, CERA 
has raised its Henry Hub price outlook for the third quarter of 2000 to $4.18 
per MMBtu, and the average for the year to $3.67 per MMBtu.

   CORNEY & BARROW, the mainly City wine bar chain, is going into the
derivatives market. The chain is thought to be the first in the
hospitality industry to take a position against our atrocious
weather.

   Sarah Heward, the managing director, got the idea after meeting a
bunch of customers who had just left Garban to set up their own
business, Speedwell Weather Derivatives. About half her wine bars
have outside terraces which have understandably not proven too
popular of late.
   "They set me up with a hedge - my counterparty is Enron US," says
Heward. This safeguards a modest Pounds 15,000 of turnover.

John,

We have  been working for the last few days on VaR related issues.
The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?

Vince

Hello Vince, 

I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, Mrs. Shirley notified me 
that you were out of the country.  Look, I need another favor.  My wife, whom 
you met last summer, and I  have been living in The Woodlands about a month 
now.  We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as 
a speech pathologist or a K-6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a 
teaching job in the Houston Independent School District. However, I would 
prefer that she taught locally, in The Woodlands.  I need to know if you know 
of anyone we can contact to get her in The Woodlands School System.  I would 
greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again.  I am attaching her 
resume' for your perusal. Thanks A Million Vince!!!

Sincerely,

Datren Williams

Michael,

It's a cottage industry and nobody can read all that's
published.  The Journal of Derivatives and
the Journal of Finance are two primary publications I would recommend.

Vince

Hi Grant and Vince,

What do you think of the Journal of Derivatives?  Would you recommend a
subscription?  If not, which publication would you suggest?

Thanks,
Michael

I recently received a brochure for the Journal of Derivatives.  This 
quarterly publication is put out by Institutional Investor, Inc. and the 
International Association of Financial Engineers.  It claims to provide the 
latest in both theory and application of derivative instruments.  PGE does 
not currently subscribe to this publication.  Do you think that your 
respective departments could benefit from the subscription?  The cost is 
$200/yr. and would be split by the number of departments (if any) interested.

Let Patrick or myself know if you are interested.

Thanks
Jay T.

Zimin,

I have a copy of the article.
I agree with you. The model is
essentially the same (in intentions).

I shall distributed the copy of the paper
to the trades here. It explains  
well the logic behind the model and it's
an independent source.

Vince

Zimin Lu
05/30/2000 10:44 AM
Vince, 

I got the article.  I can make a copy for you when I get back.
The article is pretty much for marketing purpose.   My reading
from that paper is as follows:

1. solve optimal exercise bounday using stocastic DP;
2. runing price trajectory to tracking storage level to give average storage 
cycling;

Our model addresses the same issues,  althrough maybe the implementation is
not quite the same. 

I will fax to you if I can find the article here.

Regards,

Zimin

Vince and Stinson,

I am in the London office this week. Things are quite nice here.  My host 
Anjam arranged a full itinerary for me.
Tuesday is reserved for Anjam to talk about various subjects including 
inflation modeling, power vol curve,
mean reverting price & vol model, and I will talk about the spot and 
multi-factor models, XLL. Wednesday, I
will concentrate on the gas storage model with  Natasha Danilochkina. 
Thursday and Friday I will talk to 
Haakan Olafsson, Mark Jones, Anjam, and Natasha about UK gas forward curve 
simulation, gas swing model,
and implementation issues of UK virtural storage model.   I will give you a 
full report when I get back.

It is cold and rainy here in London. It makes me feel sunny and hot Houston 
actually is not that bad.

Zimin

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student 
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.? Rusty is 
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest 
in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these 
issues pertain to the energy industry.?? In fact, you met Rusty during your 
recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma 
Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an 
interview for a summer internship on April 19.? He has been invited by Althea 
Gordon.? If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his 
visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.?  Rusty is one of the very 
best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would 
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.

Hi,
I'm sending this to all the people I know because I think it is important
to you.
Everyone wants faster internet access, primarily for the world wide web.  I
know we did.
So, we got DSL from Pacific Bell.  It was wonderful!  But, quickly we
learned that we were now exposed to hackers or others with evil intentions
because they could reach our computers directly through the net.  So, we
hired a local consultant to build us a firewall computer.  For $250 we got
a secure computer running Linux attached to our DSL on one side and our
local area network on the other and were no longer easy prey for the
cyber-hackers.
Everyone and his mother-in-law is now selling DSL or cable modem services.
 But, they don't tell you about the risks.
Read this article and remember to acquire security when you acquire faster
access.

Please respond to "Chris Strickland" <chris@lacima.co.uk>

Hi Vince,

I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  me
to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?

Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and
Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would write 
an
article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling and
energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based 
upon
sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/time
involved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some very
practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much away as the articles are 
only
1 or 2 pages long.

Each article would be of?the  form;

- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study
- provide a discussion
- sum up

I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For
example, for the first one,  "Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy
prices", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an
equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the
parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,
discuss the  results.

We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the
list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest
reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and then 
to
run your eye over  "near finished" articles, which?we would supply to you for
your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If 
it
did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly "feature" of
EPRM, authored by all three of us.

We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please
let us know if you are interested.

Best regards.

Chris.

Potental EPRM articles;

1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)

2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)

3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)

4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)

5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing
energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)

6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forward
curve and volatlity structure)

7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing
options

8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and
variation of parameters thru time

9- adding jump volatility to the tree

10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)

11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with
estimates of oil data over different  periods)

12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model from
market option prices

13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy

14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ
portfolio.

Please respond to "Chris Strickland" <chris@lacima.co.uk>

Hi Vince,

I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  me
to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?

Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and
Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would write 
an
article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling and
energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based 
upon
sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/time
involved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some very
practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much away as the articles are 
only
1 or 2 pages long.

Each article would be of?the  form;

- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study
- provide a discussion
- sum up

I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For
example, for the first one,  "Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy
prices", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an
equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the
parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,
discuss the  results.

We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the
list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest
reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and then 
to
run your eye over  "near finished" articles, which?we would supply to you for
your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If 
it
did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly "feature" of
EPRM, authored by all three of us.

We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please
let us know if you are interested.

Best regards.

Chris.

Potental EPRM articles;

1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)

2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)

3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)

4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)

5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing
energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)

6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forward
curve and volatlity structure)

7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing
options

8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and
variation of parameters thru time

9- adding jump volatility to the tree

10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)

11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with
estimates of oil data over different  periods)

12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model from
market option prices

13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy

14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ
portfolio.

Frank,
our VAR team has been looking at different ways to implement clustering and 
jumps for power prices simulation
in VAR.
I attached the suggestion we came up with and the results of clustering and 
jump parameters estimation.
Would you like to discuss this methodology? We need your input.

Please, let me know,

Thank you,

Dear All,
?
Would like to set a conference call to discuss  content for the panel 
discussion at Risk 2000 in Boston on 14 June. Perhaps I  can suggest 
wednesday 31 may at noon EST. I'm on London time and am quite  flexible if 
you would like to do earlier or indeed on another day.
?
The panellists are -
?
Vince Kaminski, Enron Corp
Richard Jefferis, Koch Energy Trading
Steven Bramlet, Aquila
?
The discussion topic is 'effectively applying  weather derivatives'
?
I think we need to establish a series of  questions around which to 
facilitate discussion. We currently don't have a  moderator and perhaps one 
of you could take this role on.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
Thanks, Oliver

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Hi Shirley,

Thanks for your message.  It's not surprising that someone who is as busy
as Dr. Kaminski is running a bit behind.  I've organized a number of
conferences, and it always turns out that the best speaker is the last one
to get his presentation ready.  We are very lucky to have him speak at our
conference, and I am happy to help.

There will be an SVGA data projector with an LCD colour data projector and
screen available.

If he would like the conference participants to have copies of his material
during his presentation, perhaps he could take it to the hotel's 24-hour
business services area when he arrives (or when it's ready) and I will pick
up the copies before registration begins at 8:00.  If he doesn't mind me
waiting to distribute the copies on the first break, I can take care of the
copying once everyone is seated and his talk begins.

If he chooses to have the copies ready first thing in the morning, please
have him request 55 (three-hole punched) copies to be charged to the
University of Waterloo's function.  If it's all right to hand them out
later, he can bring me the diskette when he comes down to the Stuart
meeting room on the third floor.  I will be there for registration and
continental breakfast beginning at 8:00.

Please let me know which he prefers.

Thanks!

Amy

Credit Risk Modeling for Financial Institutions
October 15 - 20, 2000
At Stanford University Business School

Risk management specialists, Stanford Business School professors of finance
Darrell Duffie and Kenneth Singleton will be repeating their successful
executive program on Credit Risk Pricing and Risk Management for Financial
Institutions.  The course is created for risk managers, research staff, and
traders with responsibility for credit risk or credit-related products,
including bond and loan portfolios, OTC derivative portfolios, and credit
derivatives.

This program includes:
* valuation models for defaultable bonds, OTC derivatives, and credit
derivatives, with empirical applications to corporate and sovereign markets
* empirical and theoretical assessments of models for measuring credit
risk, with correlation, for portfolios
* the strengths and limitations of current practice in credit risk
measurement
* practical issues in implementing credit modeling and risk systems
* estimation of default and transition probabilities, and the
correlations among the default risks of publicly traded companies, from
historical data

Vince,

Tanya and I feel that there is a need for a constrained optimization routine 
for our VAR related research.   Numerical recipes does not contain 
subroutines where equality and inequality contraints can be easily 
incorporated.  Also, the number of arguments that can be handled is also 
limited.

IMSL provides a comprehensive library of more than 300 C/C++  statistical and 
mathematical analysis functions.  We think that it would be of great value to 
our efforts and to the efforts of our research group.  Presently the cost is 
aproximately around $1500 and Mike Bothwell (Visual Numerics Rep) assures us 
as the version is not license protected, we all can use it as long as 
simultaneous usage is within the license.

Please let me know if you should need further information.

Thanks,

Rakesh

Mike Bothwell <mbothwell@houston.vni.com> on 03/29/2001 12:56:03 PM

Rakesh,

As we discussed, the CNL 4.0 PC libraries are not license managed.  Version
5 will be.  The PC Version 4.0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked PCs.  As expected, we would ask that Enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted
by the license.  Version 5.0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating.

With regard to Unix licensing, the current version of CNL for Unix is
license managed.  It can be licensed as node locked or floating.  If you
install the libraries on a Unix server as node locked, the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine.  A floating Unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine.

Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms.  This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data.

Dear Mr Kaminski

I hope you have been well since we last spoke.  I shall give you call later 
today but wanted to email you with an update on Energy In Europe as soon as 
possible.  Unfortunately, the workshops and Summit Day on 19th June haven't 
booked as well as we had expected and with a month left to go before the 
Conference, have had to cancel them.  Many apologies for any inconvenience 
this might cause to you and Prof. Geman - I wanted to tell you as soon as 
possible so as to cause the least amount of disruption to travel arrangements 
etc.  The main conference itself is booking fine and will continue as 
expected, and I certainly hope you are still able to attend, albeit in a 
spectator role.

I have similarly emailed Prof. Geman and will follow up with a telephone call.

Again, apologies for any inconvenience and I will call you later today to 
discuss details.

Kind Regards
Alexandra

Vincent,

It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and I
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,
agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at
Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any
questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or
you can call him at 215-898-1231.

This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that
Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved
as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership "benefits."

Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:

Friday, September 8
"WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?"
This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.
We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.
Major issues addresses include "New Economics of the Web" and
"Internet, Anywhere."

Friday, October 20
"FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES"
Designed by the ET core group and
presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging
Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join
the program.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in Paris on June 10 to "test drive" the program.

I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program
would be of value.

Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.

best regards,
Michael

Kevin,

For your information.

PROPOSAL FOR THE SALE OF CAPACITY AND ENERGY

Buyer:    ___________________________________________

Seller:    Southwestern Electric Cooperative ("SWEC")

Facility:   SWEC's St. Peter Project ("St. Peter"), in Fayette County,
Illinois.

Effective Date and Term: The term shall be June 1, 2001 through May 31, 2004

Project Configuration: New gas fired single cycle 45 MW GE LM 6000-PC with
Enhanced Sprint option.

Product: Capacity, associated energy and ancillary services.

Firmness: Capacity and energy, as offered hereunder, shall be considered
unit firm.

Point of Delivery: The Point of Delivery for capacity and energy shall be at
the generator bus bar interface at the high voltage side of the St. Peter
switchyard substation located at the St. Peter plant ("Into Ameren").

Contract Quantity: SWEC will guarantee delivery of 45 MW at the delivery
point although actual capacity could be 47 MW or more.

Heat Rate: SWEC will guarantee a heat rate of 9,750 Btu/kWh for all MWh's
scheduled and received by BUYER

Energy Charge: BUYER shall pay to SWEC $3.50/MWh for all energy purchased
for associated variable O&M.

Capacity Charges: $8.40/kW-month

Fuel Supply:   BUYER shall procure, nominate, schedule and deliver the
natural gas necessary to generate the energy requirements.  BUYER shall pay
all applicable transportation costs and taxes required to deliver natural
gas to the meter at the St.Peter plant.

Start Up: In the event the St. Peter plant is not available by June 1, 2001,
the capacity payment to be paid by BUYER will be reduced by $8,000/day  (the
"Capacity Credit") for each day, Monday through Friday, that the St. Peter
plant is not available after June 1, 2001.  In the event the reduction
exceeds the monthly capacity payment, the amount of penalty in excess of the
monthly capacity payment shall be applied pro-rata to the remaining months
in the year the deficit occurred.  For purposes of the Transaction
Agreement, the term "available" shall mean the St. Peter plant is capable of
producing 45 Megawatts of electric power at the Delivery Point.
Energy Scheduling: BUYER shall have the right, but not the obligation to
notify SWEC of its intention to receive energy with a minimum of four hours
notice prior to delivery.  When scheduled, energy must be taken a minimum of
4 hours.  Such scheduled hours shall not be included as Scheduled Hours in
the calculation of the Annual Capacity Payment Refund below.
  In the event BUYER Schedules Hours for energy delivery on a Business Day
(Monday through Friday) ahead basis by 2:00 PM CPT and the St. Peter plant
is unavailable for such Scheduled Hours, BUYER shall reduce its Annual
Capacity Payment to SWEC on a pro-rata basis for each Scheduled Hour that
the plant is unavailable through an Annual Capacity Payment Refund.  For
purposes of this provision, the Annual Capacity Payment shall be pro-rated
over the number of Scheduled Hours in each year as follows:  ACPR = [(Yearly
Scheduled Hours - Yearly Delivered Hours) / Yearly Scheduled Hours] X
(Capacity Payment X 12).  In the event BUYER has scheduled and is receiving
energy on an intra-day basis and SWEC's unit becomes unavailable, no
reduction in capacity payment shall occur.  However, SWEC shall make a
commercially reasonable effort to deliver the scheduled energy.
Scheduled Maintenance: SWEC shall not schedule any routine scheduled
maintenance on the St. Peter plant during the period beginning May 1 through
September 30 of each year.  Scheduled Maintenance shall be defined as the
shutdown of a generating unit, transmission line, or other facility, for
inspection or maintenance, in accordance with an advance schedule.

Required Maintenance: Any required maintenance during the period beginning
May 1 through September 30 of each year shall be coordinated between SWEC
and BUYER.

Transmission: BUYER shall purchase and arrange for all necessary
transmission from the Delivery Point

Response Due Date:  May 31, 2000

Jim,

Can we meet on Friday to discuss this topic.
The person who supports power, Grant Masson,
will be out for the next two days.

Vince

Hello Vince,

How are you?

Not much around except that I am seriously studying for Gmat. I am going to
take this test between June 12 to 15 and during the week following it I hope
to be ready to take TOEFL.
So far I am most concerned about writing and reading parts that require of
knowledge and using good vocabulary and for me is a time consuming because I
feel lost for words very often.
Ok, I be positive ...

I am writing to ask you for your support - recommendations.
I thought it might be more respected when I show recommendations "from here"
than from some people from different country.

Would you like to do it?

I am not quite sure what type of rec would you be able to provide me with.
I think it could be somehow based on our Aiesec relationship?
Do you have any other ideas?

I would like to bring this letter to the university next week along with my
request of application transfer from MBA dep to MS.
As for today I have enough recommendations - in numbers - but may be some
more recent one would add more value into it.
Do you need more details on: to whom it may concern or any others?

Please let me know if you can help?

Best regards

Patrycja

Vince I thought this resume might be of interest to you.  Alan Lambert is a 
personal friend of mine.  However, rather than put him onto you, I thought 
I'd send this by you first.  If you have interest please feel free to contact 
Alan directly.  If there are others you'd recommend me sending this by, 
please let me know.  If neither, please let me know so I can tell Alan its 
just not a fit.
Bruce, this guy is  looking for a risk management or quantitative type of

Dear Sheridan,=20

Thank you for taking time to speak with Brad Nebergall, Vince Kaminski and=
=20
myself regarding distance learning for the University of Texas Energy and=
=20
Finance program.  We enjoyed speaking with you regarding your plans for=20
taking the classroom to the web and feel that there are numerous=20
opportunities for Enron and UT to work together on this venture.=20

As you requested, I am sending you additional information on the services=
=20
that can be provided by Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  EBS offers two=20
distinct product offerings that could be provided to UT students. =20

1) EBS offers our customers a full spectrum of bandwidth services.  This=20
includes dark fiber, OCX-lambdas, DS3 and above circuits, and bandwidth=20
management solutions.  Our focus is to help the enterprise customer add val=
ue=20
and flexibility to their bandwidth service needs with features such as=20
bandwidth "on demand".  EBS owns over 18,000 miles of fiber optic cable tha=
t=20
provides EBS with an extensive network in the USA and Canada. =20

2) Enron offers a full turn-key streaming media service called e PowerTM =
=20
MediaCast.  This service can involve the entire management of the entire=20
process from filming through encoding, hosting and streaming or to supply t=
he=20
specific services that a client could need.   Each client  would access the=
ir=20
client's media through an URL embedded on the appropriate client=20
website(s).   The content can streamed live or stored to be played=20
on-demand.  EBS can deliver the streams at bit rates from 20kbps to 1Mbps o=
r=20
higher.  There are no additional resources (hardware, software or human)=20
required by a client to use our product. =20

Our current customers has found the superior quality of e PowerTM =20
MediaCast.has improved their ability to deliver a clear corporate philosoph=
y=20
and increase their customer retention.  The e PowerTM  MediaCast Network ha=
s=20
a distributed server architecture supported by a private global fiber and=
=20
satellite network (a pure Internet Protocol strategy) with embedded softwar=
e=20
intelligence that sets it apart from other network providers. The EBS e pow=
er=20
TM private network has dedicated servers in over 200 cities in the USA and=
=20
Canada. After the service is initiated, each client  can  access to reporti=
ng=20
of the viewership statistics for your content on the EBS Intranet Site=20
(www.epoweronline.com) that is updated on a daily basis.  Each client is=20
provided with a User ID and Password.  EBS guarantees their customers a=20
superior quality of service level.      =20

Our customers have found three major benefits.  First, Enron stores our=20
clients' content on our servers which reduces the strain on clients' centra=
l=20
servers and Website.  Second, Enron constantly monitors its clients' sites=
=20
and updates its servers regularly to keep the data fresh.  Finally, Enron=
=20
sharply cuts the time it takes a viewer to receive our clients' content by=
=20
delivering the media across Enron's private network and with the use of=20
software (bandwidth operating system) that decides within milliseconds whic=
h=20
Enron server can deliver the fastest.   To do that Enron servers, which=20
deliver our customer=01,s content, are located in over 200 cities in the US=
 and=20
Canada.  This places your content close to the end user (typically, "one-ho=
p"=20
away), and allows up to 500,000 simultaneous viewers at any time.  This=20
enables high quality, rich media to be streamed without delay and congestio=
n=20
to an end user's desktop.  In fact, Enron recently announced plans to insta=
ll=20
18,000 of our media servers (Compaq and Sun) into our global Data Centers=
=20
over a three year time period to extend our service domestically and=20
internationally.

We offer two internet sites to browse that demonstrates the true TV-like=20
experience of the e PowerTM  MediaCastexperience. =20

 1) http://www.enron.net/mediacast
 =20
 a) User name and login ID are both  -  epower4.=20

 2) http://www.enron.net/finance/srv_demo/enron/ms1250.html

 a) Once you are at this page called Today's Feature - click on the ACME TV=
=20
and chose one of the channels
 b) Chose the speed of your video player (either REAL or WindowsMedia Playe=
r)
 c) Hit the play arrow button on the "Screen" that pops

Finally, I estimate the cost per student to stream the course would be=20
approximately $75.00.  Please remember this price is for the streaming only=
,=20
and is priced on a per MB delivered basis.  In addition, there will be a fl=
at=20
monthly charge to administer the program.  Production and encoding can be=
=20
provided at an additional cost.    Therefore, if the stream rates in my=20
assumptions listed below change, our pricing will change slightly.  As you=
=20
will see the cost for the streaming would be a minimal and would not prohib=
it=20
the students from taking the course on-line.  I apologize that we do not ha=
ve=20
any example distance learning clips that we are able to share with you at=
=20
this time.  However, I would be happy to demonstrate our capabilities to yo=
u=20
on your desktop, if you are interested.=20

I look forward to discussing with you in greater detail how either of these=
=20
services could be used to expand the reach of the University and its course=
=20
offerings.    I will contact your office at the beginning of next week to=
=20
continue this discussion.  If you would like to contact me prior to next=20
week, please do not hesitate to call me at 713 853-3242.   =20

Shirley, please, remind me about it.

   
	
	

Hi Vince, I have a quick question for you.  The EOL folks want to put a 
couple of articles from the Risk book (Managing Energy Price Risk) on the 
internet.  I told them that  would be a copywrite violation.  Is there 
someone at Risk they could call to get permission for this, or is it even 
worth calling?  Thanks

Ross

Dave,

I will be glad to participate.

where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate 
level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I 
would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately  
25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I 
am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to

Marek,

Vince will be available at home on Tuesday and Friday this week,
bet 1:00 p.m. and 5 p.m. California time (3 hrs difference to NYC).

His phone number is 650 497 6938.

Wicek

Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

Any thoughts on this proposal?

Steve

Please respond to "Navroz Patel" <npatel@risk.co.uk>
Steven,
After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work 
would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion) 
and outline what has happened to:
?
?pjorion@uci.edu
?
then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this 
decision.
?
Best Wishes,
?
Navroz Patel,
Technical Assistant, Risk Magazine.

Jana,

Thanks for your message. I have recovered from my trip over
the weekend. I was waiting for my flight till early morning hours on Saturday.
I wasn't dressed for a chilly night at  La Guardia and came back with a 
slight cold.

Houston Intercontinental got a lot of rain as well. The place was full of
stranded passengers sleeping on the floors. The roof was leaking at a few 
places
and there were pools of water everywhere.

Sat, June the 3rd will work for me. Hope to see you then.

I am sorry you had such a terrible return trip.  I hope you are feeling

Unfortunately, we are not available this Saturday.  We have company coming in

Maybe, Saturday, June 3?  Let me know.

The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years
since the first edition was published. During this hiatus,
a lot has happened as risk management within the
rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as
a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich
compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative
group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.

The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that
risk management principles initially applied to a narrow
band of energy commodities can and should be applied
across a wide array of energy commodities including
electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in
capturing an international perspective on the various
challenges, which are not isolated to any one
continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy
introduction that effectively frames risk management
progress, advancements and innovations that started
in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the
natural gas and most recently expanding to the
electricity industry.

Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15
chapters, all of which include an introduction, which
minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from
a book written by a large number of authors. Other
improvements in this second edition include expanded
graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a
separate glossary, which provides the reader with
additional reference material.

In particular the chapter on energy options written by
Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the
reader with a concise explanation of option theory,
pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical
guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure
speculation. For the more advanced reader, the
chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince
Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is
particularly strong as it outlines the challenges
associated with the exotics and effectively documents
the latest methods used by leading practitioners in
pricing such instruments.

Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative
Contracts in the Energy Environment by three
consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written
summary which addresses the numerous tax related
issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see
EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax
information housed in one concise chapter is of great
value.

The second edition however is not without flaws. In
particular, it would have been useful to have more
information on the current challenges risk managers
are confronted with in the power industry including
latest advancements in volatility and correlation
estimation techniques. Additional attention could have
also been placed on the shortcomings of the current
market structure and methods in finding and applying
appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the
fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the
primary challenges.

In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the
prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the
new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome
edition to any risk management library.

I shall order reprints.

Greetings.

1.  Thanks again for hosting the dinner at Power 2000.  Congratulations
also on a thoughtful keynote address, a copy of which I picked up on the
way out of the Conference.

2.  My family and I are leaving on a family trip 5/25 thru 6/4.  Thus, I
would like to reschedule my proposed Houston visit, and presentation of the
"Enterprise-Wide Risk Management" model to Enron's Research Dept., to the
next mutually-convenient date.

Dear Vince:

I spoke with Ms Crenshaw yesterday afternoon about a conference call about
developing internet course material.   If you have already discussed this
with your colleagues, it might be helpful if you could very briefly outline
the questions and issues they might raise in the conference call so that I
can be a bit better prepared.

Ms Crenshaw also mentioned that you never received my earlier email
regarding the credit spread model I developed with Stathis and Sergey.  My
earlier email follows, and the nondisclosure agreement is attached.

I look forward to talking with you next week.

Hi Vince

Just wanted to thank you for your participation at POWER 2000  last week and 
for contributing to the success of the conference. The feedback we  received 
was absolutely glowing and we were delighted with the smooth-running of  the 
event. Thank you for being a key part of that. As always, your presentations  
went down extremely well and your presence at our events makes a big 
difference,  as people are alwyas keen to hear both form you personally and 
from ENRON as a  company.

As I mentioned to you, I have recently been given the  responsibility of 
creating and developing a new conference stream in the  financial technology 
sector under the Waters brand, so I would like to take this  opportunity to 
say how much I have enjoyed working with you in the past couple  of years and 
to wish you the best of luck in the future. Please stay in touch  and if you 
come to New York, please let me know so I can take you out for a  drink!

Best regards and thank you again both for your patience in  helping me 
research topics and for being so willing to participate at our  events.

Vince, 
I ran across this during my recruiting at Vanderbilt.  It is headed by Hans 
Stoll, one of the leading derivative academicians in the country.  I looked 
at their website briefly and thought you might be interested.  I have also 
forwarded some email correspondence between Dr. Stoll and Joe Gordon, one of 
our Associates and a former student of his at Owen School.  We have been very 
successful lately in recruiting at Vanderbilt, both at the undergrad and MBA 
levels, and have gotten some high quality people.  Please let me know if you 
have any interest in this and I would be glad to follow up with Dr. Stoll or 
help out in any way I can.

Thank you,
Mark Courtney

I dropped the ball as far as getting someone to the April meeting, but I 
would to try to get this going.

Joe,

Thanks for your note.

The purpose of the FMRC is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research, real world issues and regulation.
Members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center. They send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences. Our center is unique in its mix of academics, practitioners and
regulators. For members, such as Enron, it provides a window on the academic
world, and would give Enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities.

More information on the center can be found at
http://mba.vanderbilt.edu/fmrc/

Center members include, NYSE, Nasdaq, CME, some high tech trading firms,
Merrill Lynch....

Joining the center usually requires a top management decision, but I would
approach it through the research and the trading areas. One way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year's conference on April 13 -14. The program is on the web
site. (Membership is $10,000 per year)

Appreciate your interest and help.

Let me know if we should provide more detail to someone.

Regards,

Hans

Dr. Stoll:
Sorry for the delay, but we haven't forgotten about your interest in having
Enron participate in the FMRC.  Our holdup is determining who is the
appropriate contact person at Enron (that, and neglect).  We're not sure if
we should approach someone from trading, research, senior management, etc.
Also, any additional information on the role the participating firms play
would be helpful.

Thanks,
Joe Gordon

Grag,

I think it makes sense to visit with SKG and obtain more information.
I assume they are located in or near Boston. I shall be in Boston
in mid June and can meet them.

Greg, FYI - Jeff asked me to forward this to you for your review.  SRS
Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and C.O.O.,
Enron Corp.

Dear Jeff,

This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope
you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my
1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to
introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an
innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy
Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders
of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific Advisory
Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your
keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and
has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with
JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed
Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.
of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge
value-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, I
don't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by
Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.

SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in
electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative
Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of "strategic
negotiation" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).
Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to
any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our
initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,
e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power
instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other
web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron
Online.

SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:
1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,
bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,
the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth
available, continguity of the allocation, and such.)
2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to "static" matching.
3) It is multi-lateral.
4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.
5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in
traditional markets.

Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at
Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,
Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,
Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.

We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any
other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.
SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your
representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in
a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange
something appropriate.

Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.

With warm regards,
Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow

Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk
Management, Citizens Power

The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years
since the first edition was published. During this hiatus,
a lot has happened as risk management within the
rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as
a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich
compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative
group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.

The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that
risk management principles initially applied to a narrow
band of energy commodities can and should be applied
across a wide array of energy commodities including
electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in
capturing an international perspective on the various
challenges, which are not isolated to any one
continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy
introduction that effectively frames risk management
progress, advancements and innovations that started
in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the
natural gas and most recently expanding to the
electricity industry.

Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15
chapters, all of which include an introduction, which
minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from
a book written by a large number of authors. Other
improvements in this second edition include expanded
graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a
separate glossary, which provides the reader with
additional reference material.

In particular the chapter on energy options written by
Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the
reader with a concise explanation of option theory,
pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical
guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure
speculation. For the more advanced reader, the
chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince
Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is
particularly strong as it outlines the challenges
associated with the exotics and effectively documents
the latest methods used by leading practitioners in
pricing such instruments.

Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative
Contracts in the Energy Environment by three
consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written
summary which addresses the numerous tax related
issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see
EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax
information housed in one concise chapter is of great
value.

The second edition however is not without flaws. In
particular, it would have been useful to have more
information on the current challenges risk managers
are confronted with in the power industry including
latest advancements in volatility and correlation
estimation techniques. Additional attention could have
also been placed on the shortcomings of the current
market structure and methods in finding and applying
appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the
fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the
primary challenges.

In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy
Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the
prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the
new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome
edition to any risk management library.

Teresa,

Thanks.

John,

Sorry for the confusion.
This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute. 

Vince

John Sherriff
05/16/2000 12:20 AM
Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

John

Vince J Kaminski
15/05/2000 17:14
John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Greg,

E-commerce related proposal from Dale Nesbitt.

Vince

Vince:

Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment
collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead
investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware
you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with
non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider
partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this
arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very
attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays,
and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move
forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks
again and best regards.

Dale Nesbitt

PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with
him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.

Michael,

The science of measuring operational risk is in its early stages of 
development.
There are really no cook-book  solutions. One has to use creativity and a lot
of common sense.

Vince

Mr. Kaminsky,

Recently, I read articles published by GARP and monographs in a book 
published by GARP.  Although they are excellent sources of introduction to 
operational risk, none of them have any details on the "how to."

If you know of a good book or book(s) could you recommend one?  

Thank you.

Attached are two pieces you may find of interest that address
organizational capabilities needed to live the real options story.

The first piece, which I wrote with Laura Martin of CSFB, addresses the
capabilities needed to carry off the Time Warner / AOL merger.  The
second piece lays out some rules for strategy creation -- including the
requisite capabilities -- in a world of uncertainty.

I hope you find these of interest. Feel free to post them on your

I'll send you the DASH that was done previously for the used LNG tanker, the 
Mystic Lady (now renamed as the Hoegh Galleon).  The analysis used in this 
transaction was not detailed due the short time-frame we had to analyze this 
transaction as well as to Enron's right to terminate this charter for 
convenience.

We are presently working on the analysis for a second, new-build LNG tanker.  
When this analysis has progressed far enough that we have a draft DASH, I 
will forward it to you (this may be later this week).

thanks for your mail.

I am sorry that I'll not be available earlier,
I will talk with my advisor, but
probably it will be pretty negative.
however, I may be able to start it from June1,
depending on what he tells..
We will meet tomorrow afternoon,
so I'll be able to let you know
whether we can start work earlier then.

And could you tell me briefly
what are those projects you have in mind?

Thanks!

Go Bears!

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John

Celeste,

I am forwarding you a letter from Prof. Duane Seppi from Carnegie Mellon 
University.
I have known Duane for many years and I know that he does not make his
recommendations without very good reasons.

I would recommend looking at John Gordon as a very strong candidate:
I think he will make a terrific contribution to Enron.

Vince

ds64@MAIL1.ANDREW.CMU.EDU on 05/12/2000 01:30:14 PM
Dear Vince,

I am writing to bring to your attention a GSIA student, John Gordon, who is
currently being considered for Enron's Associates program.  My understanding
is that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as a
late addition to the program.

While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception.  He is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. Since
John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy.  John is personable and
outgoing.  Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would have
already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here.

I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.  A copy of
his resume is attached to this email.

Best regards,
Duane

Vince -
I couldn't have been more pleased than when I saw your name on the Managing 
Director promotion list last January - who says nice guys finish last!  

I've had the announcement in my "to do" folder all this time, waiting for me 
to catch up enough to send you this message, but I guess you're no stranger 
to that scenario....

Nothing stochastic about it, you're simply the best!

Betty  :)

Greg,

As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.

The offer from Enron looks much better now. I have arranged for him
a number of different interviews (including one with you). I think we should 
not be too
punitive and give him the 2nd chance. I am also setting up for him interviews 
with RAC
and EBS  and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.

Please, give me a call if you have any other question.

Vince Kaminski

Sue,

I shall be available.

Nick,

The airport is about 30 minutes  by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree 
Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making
reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
from  the Enron building.

We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00
in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related 
expenses.

Vince

Vince,

Yes, that would be ideal. But let me call first my travel agent to
see if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
constraints. What time should I be at Enron on Thursday, and how far is
the airport from your offices?

Thanks,

Nick

Scott Adams <dilbertnewsletter@unitedmedia.com> on 05/11/2000 07:47:45 PM
Dilbert Newsletter 30.0
   Highlights:
Elian Invasion
Many of you in the U.S. have been following the fate of the little
Cuban boy Elian, who came to the United States via a
dolphin-powered inner tube.  Some people believe Elian is some sort
of Holy Child because the dolphins helped him, and because he's
small, leading people to assume he is a child.  I was a believer in
the Holy Child theory until the INS swarmed Elian's relatives' home
and took him against his will.  "Where were the dolphins then?" I ask.

Maybe they were lazy dolphins.  Whatever their excuse, I'm
disappointed that we didn't get to see the INS and the dolphins
fight it out, hand-to-flipper.  That would have been good TV.
Dolphins have a great defensive move where they suddenly turn
around so your fist gets stuck in the blowhole.  Then they beat you
senseless with their powerful tails.  I think we'd all like to see that.

On the plus side, by my reckoning, Elian's dilemma has saved the
lives of at least two celebrities, maybe more.  As you know, during
slow news periods the major networks kill celebrities and make it
look accidental.  Personally, I won't board an airplane unless the
newspaper is packed with good stories.

I prefer the media's latest news-creating technique, wherein they
blame NASA for launching rockets into space and losing them.  In
reality, NASA hasn't done much of anything since 1969, when they
sent three guys in helium-filled space suits to New Mexico with a
black and white camcorder.  I still remember where I was when I saw
it on TV.  I was on Earth.

Dilbert TV Fate
I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally dozens of people
noticed when Dilbert disappeared from UPN's lineup on American TV.
Officially, UPN told me the show was put on "hiatus."  Or maybe
they said they "hate us."  It sounds the same on the telephone when
you're sobbing.

Apparently someone noticed there were four new episodes that had
never aired.  So, starting on Tuesday, May 30th at 8:30 p.m.
Eastern  (7:30 Central), the first of the new Dilbert shows airs.

In a master stroke of UPN programming brilliance, Dilbert follows
Shasta McNasty, a show geared toward viewers who are...how can I
say this...very likely to die in bowling ball cleaning machine
accidents.  Fortunately, Shasta is a filthy and sophomoric show, so
it will corner the market on perverts and unsupervised minors.
It's a perfect lead-in audience for an animated Dilbert TV show.
If you don't understand that, you will never be a television executive.

The other networks are running nothing but commercials during that
time period.  You don't need to check.  Trust me on this.

March 21st Explained
Many readers were confused by the March 21st strip featuring
Dilbert's future self visiting his past self from across time.
Dilbert asks the future Dilbert how his head got wrinkled.  Future
Dilbert points to a device on his chest with a hole in the center
and says, "Stick a finger in this hole."  That's the whole joke.

This is an example of a cartoon that appeals to no one but me, or
so I discovered from my e-mail.  I like the idea that a future
Dilbert would invent a device that has no other purpose than to
make your head deformed.  It's one of those inventions that seem
like a good idea until you try it.  But the funny part (okay, just
to me) is that he would advise his past self to stick a finger in
it, thus making the same mistake twice.

In retrospect, it was just a bad cartoon.  There wasn't enough
information.  But it made me laugh.  If you think the cartons are
made for your benefit, maybe you shouldn't be so selfish.

Why Do Some People Get Paid?
A reader sent me this story:

"Our coffee room has a bulletin board. One day a woman with a ruler
and a clipboard came in and measured the distance between the
postings on the board with the ruler. She took great care to
measure the height and width between each piece of paper, and
between the pieces of paper and the edges of the board. Then,
without a word, she checked off something on the clipboard and went away.

"I was in a daze for the next fifteen minutes.  I couldn't
concentrate during the following meeting. I wondered, does this
woman actually get paid for this? Does she find fulfillment in her
work? Who came up with the idea for this job? Are THEY just playing
with our minds, whoever THEY are?

"Needless to say I went back to the coffee room after the meeting
and moved all the postings around."

[Editor's note: To me, the funny part is that the author of this
story got paid for sitting in a daze during a meeting and later
rearranging the scraps of paper on a bulletin board.]

The DNRC at Work For You
A DNRC member reports on another benefit of membership.

"It turns out that my English tutor at Cornell is in the DNRC.  I
told her that I was in the organization too. That was a month ago
and since then I have been getting constant 'check plusses' for my
essays, regardless of my effort.

"Thanks a million!!"

If you're not already showing preferential treatment to DNRC
members, it's time to start.  Remember, only the DNRC has the good
sense to haze people who have no prospect of becoming members.

Getting Free Stuff the DNRC Way
If you're annoying enough, you can get free services almost
anywhere, as this DNRC member reports.

"My roommate and I put coins in a jar every time we used the phone.
When it was time to pay the bill, we went to the bank to get the
coins counted. The teller said there was a fee for counting money
because we didn't have an account at that bank.  The conversation
went like this:

'How much would it cost if we had an account?'

'Then it would be free.'

'How much does it cost to open an account?'

'Nothing, it's free.'

'How much does it cost to close an account?'

'Um...That's also free.'

'Then we'd like to open an account, count this money, then close
the account. That's all free, isn't it?'

"She spent a few seconds thinking about this, and then she let us
use the money-counting machine, for free."

Dilbert.com
We've revamped the "List Of The Day" area on Dilbert.com.  It's the
most popular part of the site after the comics.  Some of you DNRC
members are impressively funny.  Others just have laughably pitiful
jobs that translate into amusing list items.  Either way, it's
equally funny to me.

We've added a True Tales of Induhviduals page, at
http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/induhvidual.html.
Submit your stories and read those submitted by others.  Feed your
sense of intellectual superiority by reading how dumb other people
are.  It's a guilty pleasure, but pleasure nonetheless.

Another addition to the DNRC section is the cubicle art page, which
features art created by people who were pretending to work. Each
week the best submissions are posted at

True Tales of Induhviduals
And now, for your reading pleasure, more True Tales Of Induhviduals
-- those clueless-but-entertaining blobs of organic matter that
clog our highways and keep our taxes high.

True Tale
My company has instituted Company Values.  Arranged appropriately,
the values are Fun, Agility, Teamwork, Learning, Integrity and
Empowerment.

The acronym speaks for itself: FAT LIE

True Tale
My school subscribes to a system that is supposed to help us find
jobs when we graduate. It works by asking us what subjects we are
studying, what sort of job we want, etc.

When I input my classes and interests it came up with only two
career suggestions.

Careers in IT
Careers in LAW

Neither choice appealed to me.  I tweaked my entries to see if
other options would appear.  It wasn't until I deleted 'English
Skills' from my list of subjects studied that it added a third
career option.

Careers in MANAGEMENT

True Tale
I was standing in line at the grocery store when a loud voice came
over the intercom saying, 'Okay, shoppers, it's time for our hourly
drawing for a bag of free groceries.' In the front of the store
someone was spinning a big wheel with the numbers 1 to 8 on it. The
voice continued, "If your lane number comes up, and you are at the
front of the line, you win." I noticed that a checker was opening
the register next to me. Just at that moment, the number of that
newly opened lane came up on the wheel. The other customers were
too busy cursing their bad luck to realize that the winning
register was empty.  I casually moved over to that line. With great
fanfare, I was awarded the prize -- a bag of free groceries. It was
filled with bizarre items I would never eat, including cinnamon
rice cakes, canned collard greens, Wonder Bread and the like.  So I
gave the free bag of groceries to a woman who seemed terribly upset
at not winning it herself. She exploded with joy like she had just
won the lottery.

Induhviduals are so easy to please.

True Tale
At Denver International Airport, there are emergency exits, the
type with alarms if they are opened.  Printed on the doors are
signs that say,
"In an emergency, push and hold door for fifteen seconds until
doors open."

[Editor's note: There is a name for people who stand in the
emergency doorway for fifteen seconds during a real emergency:
"flattened."]

True Tale
I went to lunch with a new employee who was not familiar with the
city.  On the way back, he decided to stop at a bookstore.  Hours
later, my boss and I realized that he had not returned.  Fearing
the worst, we called down to our crack security guards and asked,
"If you needed to take someone to the hospital, where would you
take him?"

The guard asked me to hold.  A few minutes later he came back with
the official answer: "the hospital."

True Tale
When I received a check from my previous company for my 401K
rollover, I noticed the date on the check was 1-18-1999, even
though the check was written in January, 2000.  IRS regulations
don't allow 401K rollovers that are more than 90 days old.  I went
to my former place of employment and pointed out the error to the
HR Duhrector, who had originally written the check.  His solution
was to cross out 1999 and write 2000 above it.  Then he initialed
and dated the change... 1/25/99.

True Tale
Here are some true phrases used by my boss:

"Ah, that's the flaw in the ointment."

"There's the gem in the haystack."

"We need to increase sales!  Let's throw some more wrenches in the
fire!"

"I believe that like I believe a hole in the head!"

True Tale
My office is near Orlando, FL.  An Induhvidual in my office noticed
several people leaving the building.  She asked me, "Where is
everyone going?"  I told her we were going to watch the shuttle
launch.  She asked, "Is it outside?"

True Tale
I was buying a newspaper at the convenience store.  The clerk looks
down at the paper and says, "Is that fifty cents or a dollar? I can
never remember."

I pointed to the clearly-visible price of 50 cents printed on the
corner of the paper and said, "Fifty cents. Who'd pay a dollar for
this paper?!?"

"Oh, some people do," said the clerk.

"Really? Why?"

"Because that's what I charge them."

True Tale
My boss called me into his office.  While attaching a keyboard to
his computer, he asked if I would mind going to my desk and running
a particular program.  He needed the data right away and my
computer was the only one set up for this particular function.

I said that it was no problem and headed to my desk, only to find
that it was MY keyboard he had taken.

True Tale
A bank recently sent a letter to its bankcard holders with some
details about its new cards. The first line of the letter is a real
whopper:

"The year 2000 has come quicker than expected!"

[Editor's note: Customers of that bank might want to double-check
their interest calculations.]

True Tale
This conversation actually happened.  The names have been changed
to protect the stupid.

Jack: "G.W. Bush is fairly attractive, especially for a man his
age."

Jill: "Yeah, I guess he's gotten better looking since he was
president."

Jack: "Eh??"

Jill: "I mean, he looks much younger than he did when he was
president in '92."

Jack: "That's because it's HIS SON!"

[Editor's note:  After Dogbert takes over, Jill will be used as a
knickknack on a very large shelf.]

True Tale
Early in my career as an electrical engineer, I worked for the
Navy.  One day a directive was sent to all employees informing us,
"Should you get killed or injured on the job, you are required to
notify your supervisor immediately."

True Tale
True memo from a school principal:

     Do you know if there is any way to adjust the volume on the
     fire alarm? It is shrill and extremely loud.  If we could turn

     the volume down some it would help.

     Please advise,

     Thanks,

     <PHB-Principal>

True Tale
In the dining hall at my school, a sign reads, "At Cornell Dining,

we want all your dining experiences to be successful."

[Editor's note:  Maybe I'm twisted, but I have many images in my
head of what qualifies as "unsuccessful dining" and all of them
seem funny to me.]

True Tale
At our company we frequently need to discard empty boxes that won't
fit in trashcans.  The Induhvidual who picks up the trash ignores
anything outside the trashcan unless you tape a big sign on it that
says "TRASH."  This is very annoying but we've all gotten used to it.

In a seemingly unrelated event, folks started thinking that we
should have a "disaster plan" just in case a tornado wipes out the
building. We were told to gather up copies of everything needed to
put us back into business after a catastrophe.  Hundreds of boxes
full of documents were gathered together, categorized, inventoried,
labeled and put near the dock for transportation to the underground
caves, where they would be safe. The Induhvidual who ignores our
empty trash boxes promptly threw them all out.

True Tale
Our marketing director was nicknamed Axel. He decided to have a
departmental meeting to explain his new role after the
reorganization.

He compared the company to a car, and the various departments as
the wheels.  To finish off, he asked a question. "So, what do you
think keeps the wheels attached to the car?" He expected someone to
shout "The axle," relating to his own role and nickname. To his
annoyance, someone yelled out "The nuts."

True Tale
As I was being terminated, the VP asked that I not be too critical
of him in case he hadn't made the right choice in firing me. This
was an unpleasant experience for him. He also asked for my
understanding because he might have to fire more people later in
the week.  In the company's management training, they stress the
need for empathy when letting an employee go. No doubt he missed
the part where they said empathy TOWARDS OTHERS.

True Tale
I was having dinner recently at a nice restaurant and I asked the
waiter if the soup had meat in it.  His reply:  "Not really."

True Tale
I'm a Democrat but I voted in the Republican primary because I can
in South Carolina.  While in line at the voting location I talked
to two married Induhviduals. One was voting for Bush and the other
for McCain.  When I asked them if they weren't concerned that their
votes would cancel each other out, the husband said, "Well, we
wouldn't normally even vote, but we wanted to come out and cancel
out all those Democrats who were going to vote Republican today."

Revenge Is A Dish Best Served to Someone Else
Approximately every ten minutes some @$$hole gives out my public
e-mail address instead of his or her own to an online store.
People do this so they don't get deluged with junk mail.  But
online stores are getting smarter.  They send confirmations to my
address before initiating the service or mailing the product.  The
confirmation letters often include information identifying the
culprit.  Recently a Patricia White from Virginia ordered some
magazines online and used my e-mail address so I would get her junk
mail.  I was more than happy to "correct" her name as it would
appear on the shipping labels of her monthly magazines.

Here was my response to the online store's confirmation request.

Dear Sirs,

re: Order Number: 16496863

Please change my last name to my married name, as I will be using
that more commonly.

     Old name: Pat White

     Change to New name: Pat McGroin

Thank you for your attention.

    P. McGroin

Dogbert Answers My Mail
In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are real e-mail
messages sent to me.  The names have been changed to make them
easier to mock.

The first letter is from someone who objected to my strip in which
Dogbert gave Ratbert a bumper sticker reading WWDD (What Would
Dogbert Do).  It was inspired by the popular WWJD (What Would Jesus
Do) bumper stickers.  I thought I was mocking bumper sticker
wisdom, not Christianity, but many readers felt differently.

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have long been a fan of Dilbert, but your strip of today was
worse than witless.  Your cartoon that mocks the WWJD slogan serves
no purpose other than to profane.  You obviously had a case of IQ
catatonia when you drew it.  Evidently, it spread to your editor as
well when you submitted it.  Keep it up and you'll be relegated to
the ash heap of once-trendy nitwits who didn't know the difference
between humor and inflammatory idiocy.

    Byron C.

Dear Boron,

I'm glad you are committed to your philosophy of doing what Jesus
would do.  I assume that includes writing insulting letters to
cartoonists on company time.  Apparently the bibles in Alabama have
a few extra chapters.  If I were you, I wouldn't take too many
suggestions from the Book of Willy.

     Sincerely,

     Dogbert

(This message suspiciously had no greeting)

You are an incredible talent, and I am always impressed by your
work.

Cutting to the chase, I have established a web site to help fund my
college tuition. It is www.justinduke.com.  If you like anything
you see there, please send me a dime.

If you like, tell your friends, thanks.

      Justin

Dear Dustbin,

If your web site sucks and your message to me is a poorly disguised
mass mailing, please send me a dime.

      Sincerely,

      Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

We are currently trying to raise money to buy new uniforms and
instruments for the Knoxville schools' music programs.  We are
organizing a celebrity auction, and would be greatly honored if you
could donate an autographed item or some other piece of memorabilia
to help make our auction a success.

Sincerely,
Terry F.
Vice-President Knoxville Music Boosters

Dear Hairy F.,

I can think of no charitable cause more worthwhile than increasing
the supply of bad music in Knoxville. Unfortunately, Mr. Adams has
already given away most of his possessions to other celebrity
auctions.  It's slim pickings now.  But you could have his comb
(rarely needed), his old toothbrush (in six months), and the holes
in his socks.

       Sincerely,

       Dogbert

Dear Reader,

Hello! I'm Avinash from Bombay, India. I'm 18 years old and am
presently in college. I require a currency note of any denomination
from the United States of America or any Latin American country for
a geography project that I'm presently working on. I would be
extremely grateful if you could mail a note to my address which
I've written below. If you cannot, then thanks anyway for taking
the time to read my e-mail.

       Avinash
       Bombay, India.

Dear Avinashwipe,

This is an amazing coincidence.  I too am doing a project that
involves collecting currency from other countries.  After you
finish your project, maybe you could send the piles of money to me
for my project.  My project is a bit more ambitious than yours; I'm
collecting all of the currency from every country.

       Sincerely,

       Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

I am in the midst of an argument and I need a fresh perspective and
I figured that you had an opinion on everything, so.... which came
first, the freaking chicken or the egg?

      Gregory

Dear Eggory,

Put your finger in this hole.

     Sincerely,

     Dogbert

Dilberito Update
Tip:  It's illegal and immoral to slay your enemies, but if you eat
nutritious food and outlive them, you can still dance on their
graves.  There's nothing illegal or immoral about dancing.

The Dilberito, a tasty burrito packed with 100% of your daily
values of 23 vitamins and minerals, is on grocery shelves and
selling briskly.  Check http://www.dilberito.com for names of
stores.

Coming soon, all four flavors of the Dilberito will be vegan (two
are now).  And watch for a free downloadable Dilberito game this
summer.  Details will be on the website.

Dilbert Fodder
What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic, TV show or newsletter.  The best comic
fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations
of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended
management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

Top news this week included early findings by credit ratings agency
Standard & Poor=01,s that internationally active banks may find it is cheap=
er
to use the standardised risk management approach to capital management
rather than the internal ratings based (IRB) system. Early findings that
IRB, as laid out in the Basel Committee's new capital Accord proposals,
may cost banks more in terms of capital appears contrary to the =01+spirit=
=01,
of the de facto international banking regulator=01,s proposals. Next week,
RiskNews will print exclusive coverage of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association=01,s (Isda=01,s) response to Basel as part of our
extensive coverage of Isda=01,s 16th Annual General Meeting in Washington.

With consolidation seeming imminent for the plethora of electronic trading
platform providers, electronic derivatives trading platform Blackbird=01,s
chief executive Andy Baxter admitted having difficulties encouraging
dealers to move away from phone broking. In a separate development, JP
Morgan Chase selected multi-bank FX trading portal Atriax as its
electronic portal =01) a move seen by industry observers as a blow to rival
portal FXall, which was strongly backed by the pre-merger JP Morgan.

Meanwhile, Citigroup=01,s top FX salesman Martin Dyer pans to take =01+time=
-out=01,
from his post after 20 years, clearing the way for Lars Olesen to be
appointed global FX sales manager of Citibank Foreign Exchange in London.

The slides are OK. How are the negotiations with RISK proceeding?
They had recently many changes (firing people).

Hi Jana,

Let's make it dependent on the movie theater and choose a
restaurant nearby.
My treat.

That sounds good.  I hope you have a good trip to NY.  Let me know if you
need any restaurant suggestions.  I went to some good ones last week.

Jana

Hi Jana,

Saturday, May the 20th looks good.
I shall be in NYC May the17th through 19th (flying back on Friday).
There are several good movies I would like to see.
We can connect later next week to select one.

Take care,

on their flower crop.

Weather is definatly picking up on this side too with more interest every
day.

Hope all is well,

If it's new EBS products you're after, how about a real-time bandwidth swing 
contract with automatic exercise?  The customer pays for the minimum 
(baseload) bandwidth they need for their (say) videoconference, with a 
premium on top that automatically buys them extra bandwidth as it becomes 
available from the system.  They are guaranteed a minimum quality they can 
live with, and (more than likely) they get improved quality much of the time 
for a bargain price.

We get to charge for the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be idle.

Steve

Steve,

I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studies
computer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me. Computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of 
spare capacity on their systems.

But we can always try. We shall take this idea, to the person in EBS 
responsible for the 
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details.

EBS is dying to come up with some new products.

Have any investigations been made of the issue of trading (spare) processing 
power?  Such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth 
business, since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around, as 
would their results.

Obvious technical and legal problems are:
1.  Standardisation.  (Java?)
2. Security and confidentiality.

Just a thought that's been buzzing around my head for a while.

Molly,

I am enclosing my recommendation letter for Yvan Chaxel.

Vince

Dale, Richard,

I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the 
summer).
I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons. I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader
in not too distant future. He needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research. I think it will be in the best interest of 
the company
to devote some resources to foster his development.

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

Top news this week included early findings by credit ratings agency
Standard & Poor=01,s that internationally active banks may find it is cheap=
er
to use the standardised risk management approach to capital management
rather than the internal ratings based (IRB) system. Early findings that
IRB, as laid out in the Basel Committee's new capital Accord proposals,
may cost banks more in terms of capital appears contrary to the =01+spirit=
=01,
of the de facto international banking regulator=01,s proposals. Next week,
RiskNews will print exclusive coverage of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association=01,s (Isda=01,s) response to Basel as part of our
extensive coverage of Isda=01,s 16th Annual General Meeting in Washington.

With consolidation seeming imminent for the plethora of electronic trading
platform providers, electronic derivatives trading platform Blackbird=01,s
chief executive Andy Baxter admitted having difficulties encouraging
dealers to move away from phone broking. In a separate development, JP
Morgan Chase selected multi-bank FX trading portal Atriax as its
electronic portal =01) a move seen by industry observers as a blow to rival
portal FXall, which was strongly backed by the pre-merger JP Morgan.

Meanwhile, Citigroup=01,s top FX salesman Martin Dyer pans to take =01+time=
-out=01,
from his post after 20 years, clearing the way for Lars Olesen to be
appointed global FX sales manager of Citibank Foreign Exchange in London.

Rosalinda

I work with Melanie Doyle in London HR.  I have two candidates who I'm trying 
to arrange (for Bryan Seyfried) to come in and see Vince Kaminski however I'm 
finding it difficult to co-ordinate from this end.  Would it be possible for 
you to forward these CV's on to Vince's assistant as I'm not sure who the 
correct person is.

Thanks for your help and if you need more details my number is 44 20 7783 
6945.

Regards
Louise

Steve,

I can pick up the cost of your trip from the Research Group budget.

The more I think about  it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult 
to justify 2 trips per person. I think that we should go for one contiguous 
stay per person and make a good
effort to make these trips productive.

Vince

Steven Leppard

Vince

Thanks for offering to look my presentation over.  The deadline for 
submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a 
hurry.

As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.  
Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to 
visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter 
visit.  I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the 
only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.

I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no 
doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.  
It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly 
think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his 
while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK 
without the need to go to Houston for further training.

I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's 
videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.

All the best,
Steve

Sorry for the delay in sending you my comments.

Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and C.O.O.,
Enron Corp.

Dear Jeff,

This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hope
you recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow & me when you keynoted at my
1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted to
introduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing an
innovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers Kuppuswamy
Seshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal founders
of SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific Advisory
Board. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during your
keynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG and
has been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch with
JP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. Ed
Colloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.
of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have huge
value-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, I
don't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision by
Bob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.

SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization in
electronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (Alternative
Trading Systems). It achieves this through a process of "strategic
negotiation" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).
Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement to
any extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Our
initial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,
e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/power
instruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and other
web-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to Enron
Online.

SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:
1)  It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,
bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,
the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidth
available, continguity of the allocation, and such.)
2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to "static" matching.
3) It is multi-lateral.
4)  It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.
5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do in
traditional markets.

Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading at
Fidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,
Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,
Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.

We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or any
other Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.
SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or your
representative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, in
a meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange
something appropriate.

Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.

With warm regards,
Joseph Cherian and Robert Jarrow

FYI

Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Best regards,

Is there any chance we can schedule my visit to Enron on Friday, May 19,
or Friday, May 26?

By the end of April I was able to attract a top new student to work on the 
project.
The other one for the coming year will be Giuseppe. By spending the summer
at Enron, he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at Stanford to look at these problems.

I must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going.

Talk to you soon,

Nick

We wanted to catch up with you on where you are on ideas for testing.  Also, 
I think we will need to get testing N America power and gas hedges on genco

Vince,

one of my colleagues here at Baylor is writing a book about "the business
of heaven" in which he interviews prominent business leaders.  Bob Darden
is his name and he's a former journalist and nice guy.  He would like to
contact Ken Lay about being one of his interviews.  Do you think this is
possible?  If so, could you give me an address/phone numbers that Bob might
use to contact Ken's secretary about setting up an interview?

If this is in any way "not ok" please just say so.

See ya,

John

Dear Vince Kaminski,
 I was auditing Prof Dyer's Real Options class on Thursday when you spoke
on Enron's activities in this area.  I would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Kenyon

Elizabeth,

Yes, she referred Norberto to us. We had an informal interview
with him.

We would like to  invite him for a round of formal interviews later this week.
Please include me, Tanya Tamarchenko, Ted Murphy, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni,
Grant Masson.

I asked Liza to talk to you to set up formal arrangements with Enron
HR (a contract, fee schedule approval, etc.).

I shall ask you for help next week when we have more information:
several members of our group  from London will rotate through our Houston
office this summer. We shall need help in making living  arrangements,
including apartments, car, etc. Also, we have an employee from India
rotating through our group this summer. Please, let me know 
who is the best person in HR to ask for assistance.

Dear Vince,

Thanks for attending the energy derivatives course, and I hope you found it 
valuable.

There's been some interest from other course attendees to put together a 
contact list and distribute it to one another.  I'm contacting you to see if 
you or Zimin Lu have any objection to being included on the list.  We will 
include only details that you approve, such as name, company name, address 
and email if you wish.

We would like to send out the list early next week, so please let us know.

Good morning Denise:

After discussing this situation with Mike Roberts, Vice President in charge
of the Weather Group, neither he nor I were aware of the existing contract,
As was mentioned in our conversation, I thought I had cancelled this back 
in November when Jim Gooding left the company.

However, since there are just two payments owed (March and April 2000),
we will pay this amount and ask that the contract be cancelled.  As you
are aware, this service has not been used since last  November and Mike
says that he knows of no one it can be transferred to.

Please send us a final bill in the amount of $980.00 (2 months) and cancel
the contract.

If you need this cancellation request in "formal Letter" format, please let 
me know.

Thanks for your help.

Vince,

 If you take a cab, ask them to take you to the College of Business
building at the corner of 21st and Speedway.  The main entrance to the
business school is on Speedway, across from the old gymnasium.  Come in the
main entrance, which has a large, glass structure, and you will be on the
second floor.  Go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor.  When you step off of the escalators, you'll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building.  This is where most faculty offices are
found.  My office is 3.218, which is in the northwest corner of the
building.

 If you have any problems, you should be able to ask directions from
most anyone in the halls.  I will look for you around 11:00 on Thursday, and
will be happy to provide any other transportation that you need.  Please let
me know if you have any other questions.

 Jim

Jim,

I can  take a cab or get a rental car from the airport  (thanks for your
kind offer).
I shall appreciate, however, if you could drop me off at the hotel before
dinner.

The time allocation for my speech is about right. I think I shall need
about 90
minutes.

Please let me know where we can meet on Thursday.  I shall be at an
off-site
on Wednesday but you can reach me on my cell phone (713 410 5396)
and by sending a cc message to my AOL address: vkaminski@aol.com.

I  look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Jim Dyer <Jim.Dyer@bus.utexas.edu> on 05/01/2000 01:42:44 PM

Vince,

     I could pick you up at the airport, or you could rent a car and come
to campus.  I have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11:30 and 12:00, and then you would have some time to
visit with Sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class.

     Sheridan and a guest speaker from his class, Suresh Sundaresan from
Columbia, will be joining us for dinner.  I could provide transportation to
your hotel, and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative.

     I will have a PC available in the classroom, with Office 2000 and
windows NT.  You could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine,
if that's most convenient.  You could simply email the presentation, and I
would have it for you if you prefer.

     How much time would you like?  I would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options, and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
(which
is required for all classes).  At some point, we should take a brief break,
so that would leave approximately 1.5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility.  Otherwise, I could take up the "slack".

     I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

     Jim

Jim,

I am scheduled to arrive in Austin on May 4 at 10:32 a.m.
I shall be glad to join you and a group of your colleagues for lunch.
I am flying back to  Houston Friday morning and we can meet for dinner
after
the class.

I shall have a Power Point presentation on my PC. I can also
prepare a set of transparencies if this is more convenient for you.

Vince

Jim Dyer <Jim.Dyer@bus.utexas.edu> on 04/27/2000 05:44:51 AM

Vince,

     I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after
his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute "panel discussion" with the students on
issues related to real options in practice.l

     I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan
lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

     I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to
hearing from you.

Ehud,

Sorry I shall miss you on Thursday.

I shall definitely attend you presentation at Power 2000.

I shall ask about a guest accounton EOL. Typically, such an account allows
an outside user to take a look at the system, but I don't think the traders 
will allow
systematic access to the price data over a long period of time by a third 
party.

Vince

Vince,

Greetings.

I am following up at this time with respect to the above issues we
discussed in San Antonio.

1.  I am leaving Thur. morn for Philadelphia, and shall not be back until
late Fri.  (My ETD is 9:40 a.m., which I understand is less than an hour
before your arrival ...)  Thus I shall regrettably miss your current UT
visit, which we had hoped to also use as an opportunity to present/discuss
my enterprise-wide risk management model.

2.  That said, I shall be presenting an abridged version of this model at
Power 2000's first day, 5/9 4:15 - 4:55 p.m.  While I realize you'll be
very busy over Power 2000's two days, should your schedule permit, I should
most welcome the opportunity for you to see the model.

3.  Per your suggestion in San Antonio, I would like to take this
opportunity to inquire whether I might obtain an Enron On-Line account to
obtain electricity prices quoted by Enron.

I look forward to seeing you at Power 2000.  Best Regards,
Ehud

I think that you should spend here at least 3 weeks.

Hi Vince,

One of my only windows of opportunity right now is to schedule the Houston 
visit for Monday 10th July for a single week only.

Vince, Dale

Here are our proposals for Houston visits from our group:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.
Matt  Not a permanent Research Group member.  I'm asking Richard's group to 
pay for his visit, probably in August.

Steve

Attached are our contingent Call Options Trading Limit request.  Could you 
please review and I will (hopefully) get your signature on Monday.  Thanks 
and have a great weekend.

M. Mugabe avait fait adopter, le 19 mars 1992, par le Parlement, une loi
permettant d'exproprier les riches fermiers blancs pour installer sur leurs
vastes propri,t,s un grand nombre de petits paysans noirs. Poursuivant son

Comment d,couper Microsoft ?, par Fran?ois L,vque???  Mis . jour le vendred=
i 28 avril 2000???Le d,mantSlement de Microsoft est envisag, pour mettre fi=
n aux pratiques?anticoncurrentielles de l'entreprise de Redmond. Dans quel =
sens d,couper la?soci,t, et en combien de morceaux ? Il y a plusieurs solut=
ions possibles mais?il est difficile d'en choisir une.??Une premiSre option=
 consiste . d,couper Microsoft selon un trait horizontal?qui s,parerait les=
 activit,s d,di,es aux logiciels d'application de celles du?systSme d'explo=
itation. Ce d,membrement en deux morceaux r,sout la question?des produits l=
i,s, comme le rattachement abusif d'Internet Explorer .?Windows, mais n'ent=
ame pas le monopole de Microsoft sur le march, des?systSmes d'exploitation =
pour ordinateur personnel.??DeuxiSme solution : proc,der . un d,coupage ver=
tical qui diviserait?l'entreprise de Bill Gates en mini-Microsofts identiqu=
es. Le nombre de ces?Baby Bills (nomm,es ainsi par la presse am,ricaine par=
 analogie avec les Baby?Bells cr,,es lors du d,mantSlement d'ATT) doit tre =
au moins de trois pour
instaurer la concurrence.

Un troisiSme d,membrement envisageable est de combiner divisions horizontal=
e
et verticale. Il donnerait naissance . quatre entreprises : trois Baby
Windows, et une Baby Applications, qui conserveraient la libert, d',tendre
leurs activit,s vers l'amont ou vers l'aval.

Chacune de ces solutions entraOne des cons,quences diff,rentes pour le
consommateur et r,clame des mesures d'accompagnement plus ou moins co-teuse=
s
pour l'administration. Le d,membrement en deux morceaux aboutit . la perte
des ,conomies li,es . l'int,gration verticale (c'est l'id,e que la
connaissance complSte du systSme d'exploitation permet de d,velopper .
moindre co-t des logiciels d'application). Ces ,conomies sont toutefois ass=
ez
faibles selon les experts.

Le co-t du d,mantSlement horizontal serait donc modeste pour les
consommateurs. Ce qui n'est pas le cas du d,membrement vertical. Les Baby
Bills vont mener des strat,gies de diff,renciation qui vont conduire . une
fragmentation des standards. Les nouvelles versions de Windows ne seront pl=
us
compatibles.

La troisiSme solution cumule les deux inconv,nients. Sur le plan des
b,n,fices, le classement s'inverse. En effet, le b,n,fice attendu des mesur=
es
de d,mantSlement est celui qu'apporte la concurrence (baisse des prix et
acc,l,ration de l'innovation). Or la concurrence est d'autant plus forte qu=
e
le nombre d'entreprises est grand et qu'aucun monopole ne subsiste sur les
march,s.

Le d,mantSlement vertical et horizontal en quatre morceaux laisse esp,rer u=
n
plus grand b,n,fice que le d,mantSlement vertical en trois morceaux, qui
lui-mme est plus avantageux pour le consommateur que le d,mantSlement?horiz=
ontal en deux morceaux. Du c"t, des co-ts administratifs, le?d,membrement h=
orizontal et vertical est ,galement la solution la plus?avantageuse. La seu=
le t?che des pouvoirs publics est d'empcher les alliances
et les fusions. Les d,penses de contr"le sont trSs ,lev,es en revanche dans
le cas du d,mantSlement horizontal. Des mesures de r,glementation, comme la
tarification administr,e, doivent n,cessairement compl,ter le dispositif
puisque le monopole de Windows est maintenu intact. Le cas du d,mantSlement
vertical occupe une position interm,diaire. Il appelle simplement des mesur=
es
r,glementaires transitoires, comme l'interdiction faite au personnel r,part=
i
au d,part dans les trois soci,t,s de changer imm,diatement de Baby Bill (de
rejoindre par exemple celle qui resterait dirig,e par Bill Gates).

L'objectif poursuivi par les autorit,s de la concurrence est de servir
l'int,rt du consommateur. La solution qui devrait tre choisie par la
division antitrust am,ricaine est donc celle qui maximise l',cart entre le
b,n,fice apport, par une plus grande concurrence et le co-t induit par la
perte en ,conomies d'int,gration verticale et de compatibilit,. La
comparaison entre le d,mantSlement horizontal et le d,mantSlement combin, e=
st
ici difficile. Dans le premier cas, il faut soustraire un faible co-t d'un
faible b,n,fice tandis que dans le second, il faut retirer un co-t ,lev, d'=
un
b,n,fice ,lev,.

On peut en revanche ,liminer facilement la solution du d,mantSlement
vertical. En effet, en compl,tant le d,coupage vertical par un d,coupage
horizontal, l'intensit, de la concurrence augmente fortement et donc le
b,n,fice pour le consommateur tandis que ce dernier subit un faible surco-t=
.
Restent donc deux solutions possibles que seules des ,valuations chiffr,es
permettraient de d,partager. Les autorit,s de la concurrence am,ricaines
s'apprtent . demander un d,mantSlement horizontal, ce qui reflSte sans dout=
e?que la solution combin,e est moins favorable au consommateur.??Si l'objec=
tif poursuivi est l'int,rt g,n,ral - un objectif que l'on peut
prter aux juges - le choix de d,mantSlement doit aussi tenir compte des?co-=
ts des mesures de contr"le pour l'administration. La solution . retenir?n'e=
st alors plus forc,ment la mme puisqu'il s'agit maintenant de maximiser
le gain pour le consommateur net du co-t administratif. Si les ,conomies po=
ur
l'administration que permet de r,aliser le d,mantSlement horizontal et
vertical l'emportent sur la r,duction du gain pour le consommateur (due en
particulier . la fragmentation des standards), la cr,ation de trois Baby
Windows et d'un Baby Applications est une meilleure solution. Rien ne dit
donc que le juge Thomas Penfield Jackson retiendra l'option de d,mantSlemen=
t
en deux morceaux propos,e aujourd'hui par les plaignants.

Vince,

How are you? Hope all is well.

Is there any chance we can schedule my visit to Enron on Friday, May 19,
or Friday, May 26?

By the end of April I was able to attract a top new student to work on the 
project.
The other one for the coming year will be Giuseppe. By spending the summer
at Enron, he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at Stanford to look at these problems.

I must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going.

Talk to you soon,

Nick

Steve,

The schedule is fine with me. One consideration is that in 2 cases
it would require two, as opposed to one, round trips. Please, talk to  Dale 
about it and make sure that it is fine with Richard and the RAC  group (they 
will have to pay for it).

Richard has agreed to pay for Matt's visit, so here's the schedule so far:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
      (No crossover with Matt, ensures power cover in London office.)
Matt  A couple of weeks in August. (Preferably the hottest ones.)
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.

that this was the best MS 150 ever. We know you=01,re anxious to hear some
results, so here=01,s the latest:

&#61623; 7,500 people registered (2,440 registered online at
www.ms150.org)
&#61623; Approximately 6,500 people actually rode (based on packets picked
up)
&#61623; Total online donations at www.ms150.org as of April 28 =3D $186,38=
9
&#61623; Number of hits per day at www.ms150.org =3D 65,000 +
&#61623; We=01,re still collecting and processing pledges daily, so we don=
=01,t
know how much money we=01,ve raised yet. However, it looks like we=01,re we=
ll on
our way to raising $3 million, if not more! If so, this will be the first
time any MS bike tour has ever raised $3 million! Please help us by
getting all pledges turned in by May 19.
&#61623; We=01,re thankful and proud to announce that there were no serious
injuries on the Tour this year. Yes, we did transport one rider via
life-flight to Memorial Herman Hospital for precautionary measures, but he
was treated and released on Saturday evening and he was back in La Grange
by 9:00 p.m.! His brother rode the MS 150 as well, so he wanted to be
there for the finish. He suffered a broken rib and is reportedly doing
fine. All other riders were treated and released by Monday morning. Most
of the medical emergencies were heat related. As you know, it was very hot
on Sunday and people simply weren't staying hydrated.

There are so many people who make this ride happen =01) most of which are
volunteers. We couldn=01,t do the ride without our wonderful volunteers so =
we
can=01,t say thank you enough. Over half the riders participate on a
corporate or social team and each has their own group of volunteers. We'd
like to thank each of you for everything you do; we know it's a lot of
hard work!

We=01,d also like to introduce and thank the rest of the staff of the Lone
Star Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. You may have seen

Natural Gas Supply Chasing  Demand

    Natural gas suppliers face a tough challenge in meeting strong growth in
demand in the near future, experts told an industry conference in Houston
yesterday. The MMS and the National Petroleum Council have projected that
demand for natural gas could rise to 30 Tcf a year by 2010 from current
levels of 22 Tcf. Finding and delivering enough natural gas to meet such an
increase, even if demand takes another ten years to reach such levels, will
be not be easy, the conference was told. The Gulf of Mexico currently
provides about a quarter of the nation's natural gas requirements and is
expected to generate the majority of future production growth. The MMS says
that natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico would likely rise from
about 5 Tcf a year now to a peak of 6.1 Tcf in 2005 and then start to
decline.  At best, production would peak at 6.7 Tcf in 2010 then bedin to
decline. Chevron says that to meet demand of 30 Tcf by 2020, average daily
gas production in the Gulf of Mexico would have to rise to 22 Bcf cubic feet
from about 14 Bcf now. The GRI says it expects the Gulf of Mexico and Canada
to be 'key pillars' in meeting US demand for natural gas. The GRI projects
that Gulf of Mexico production can reach 8 Tcf a year by 2015, while Canadian
imports will rise to 4 Tcf a year from 3 Tcf. Over the same period the GRI
forecasts that supply in the lower 48 states can grow by 5.7 Tcf, with the
Rocky Mountains region contributing a third of the increase. Ziff Energy said
planners and forecasters might be taking too pessimistic a view of production
decline rates from mature gas wells in the shallow waters of the Gulf of
Mexico. Those wells usually show a rapid decline in production in the early
years of their life but then they tend to maintain stable output for
relatively long periods. Also, the MMS said new technologies such as
gas-to-liquid conversion, could help to harness stranded gas in remote
locations where pipeline systems cannot be built. Storage will also play an
increasingly important role.

Offshore Drillers Beginning to Recover

    The offshore oil and natural gas drilling sector has enjoyed a modest
upturn in fortunes for the first quarter, but their mood remains far from
jubilant as earnings lag well behind the peak levels of 1998. The benefits of
the strong recovery in oil prices over the past year have been slow to
trickle down to drilling contractors because most large producers have not
raised their drilling budgets. Over the last week most US drilling companies
have reported sharp earnings declines for the first quarter of 2000, compared
to a year ago. However, many of them posted better numbers than in the final
quarter of 1999 and even managed to better Wall Street's estimates of
earnings per share by a few cents. Although earnings are still showing scant
upward momentum, their stock prices have performed strongly since last year
in anticipation of a gradual improvement. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange
oilfield services index, rose 66.8% in 1999 and is up another 31% so far this
year. So far, the recovery has been largely confined to the shallow waters of
the Gulf of Mexico, fueled by a scramble to produce more natural gas.
Day-rates for Gulf of Mexico jackups have risen 30% compared with the final
quarter of 1999, with utilization rising to 99% from 87%. Day-rates for
jackups in the North Sea and Asia, however, have fallen with utilization of
down to 77% from 81%.

Vince,

 I am traveling at this time, attending a NSF meeting in Washington.
However, I wanted to touch base regarding plans for your presentation in my
class on real options next Thursday (May 4).  As you recall, the class is
from 3:30 to 6:30, and you could plan to take a significant part of that
time for your presentation.  Sheridan Titman has agreed to join us after his
class at about 6:00 for a 30 minute "panel discussion" with the students on
issues related to real options in practice.l

 I am not sure about your travel plans, but we would be happy to plan
lunch on Thursday with several of my colleagues.  I would also be delighted
to be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you.

 I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward to
hearing from you.

 Dear Vincent,

 With respect to you wanting to know more about our company here is
some background.

 Rochester was formed in 1982 to focus on the executive search for
senior individuals within Investment Banking and Commodity markets. The
operation is based in London with a global network of associates. Business
is primarily generated in Europe with an ever increasing demand from both
Asia and the United States.

 More specifically with respect to Enron, Rochester has been involved
in the Energy markets since the opening of the International Petroleum
Exchange in London. In the early 1990's, with the advent of UK deregulation,
Rochester was placing electricity traders. As always, with politicians
changing their minds, deregulation did not happen and market interest in
Energy and Power declined.

 Now that Europe is to deregulate a number of trading houses,
investment banks and the utilities have expressed a strong interest in
building their market presence. Subsequently we are working on a number of
projects that not only require traders but also complete staffing solutions.

 This includes:

 1.) Board level directors
 2.) Asset management
 3.) Corporate finance
 4.) Trading:
   - Vanilla ( financial and physical ) instruments
   - OTC derivatives ( Credit / Equity )
   - Options
   - Structured products

 5.) Relationship management
 6.) Management consulting
 7.) Corporate lawyers

 Whilst power and energy are growth areas in themselves emissions and
weather derivatives are rapidly becoming a great source of interest. For
your guide a former employee of Rochester is now heading up the emissions
marketing group at OM here in London.

 Rochester has a strong track record, and through repeat and referral
business, is rapidly establishing itself as a leader in this new and
exciting global market.

 Should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to
contact us here in London. I look forward to speaking with you again and
promoting an understanding of mutuality between our two organisations.

 With kind regards

 Damian Goodburn

Good morning, Vince.

We deposited the check and made the 7 purchases today.  The one Ginnie Mae
did have enough but the minimum purchase amount was $25m.  I purchased it,
you wanted 20m and you still has plenty in money market to cover it.

The CMA Tax exempt money market has a 7 day yield of 3.71%.  We can change
your money market to that if you would like.

We signed you up for ML on.  The web address is www.newmlol.ml.com.  The Log
on ID is 0400432840.  The pass word is the one you gave me last night.  Take
a look at it and tell me what you think.

It was nice visiting with you last night.  Next time, we will have a drink!

Call me if you have any questions.  I will call you on Monday.

Today's focus: Getting Linux-certified
Most networking professionals are probably familiar with certification
programs for various operating systems and technologies. With more
enterprises using Linux, several companies have started to offer Linux
certification and training.

One of the most popular programs is run by - not surprisingly - the top
Linux company, Red Hat. The leading Linux distributor offers training
and certification of its product for network professionals in a program
similar to system-specific certifications such as Certified Novell
Engineer and Microsoft Certified Software Engineer.

Red Hat=01,s Certified Engineer (RHCE) program is a five-day course that
consists of four one-day labs followed by a certification test taken on
the fifth day. Prerequisites for the course include knowledge of basic
Intel- and Intel clone-based hardware architecture, familiarity with
basic Unix file structure and shell programming, TCP/IP networking
skills and network administration experience. The test can also be
taken on its own, without the four days of labs.

Unlike the widely accessible Microsoft or Novell certification programs,
RHCE courses and tests are only available at Red Hat training
facilities in Durham, N.C., Portland, Ore., San Francisco and Santa
Clara. The course costs $2,498; the test can be taken alone for $749.

Red Hat certification can be valuable for companies investing heavily
in Red Hat Linux as an alternative network operating system, or for IT
professionals looking for a certification feather in their caps.
However, the program has been criticized by some for its poor
accessibility and high cost. The single-distribution focus of the
training has also been at issue with some Linux users looking for
certification options.

For Linux certification and training that isn=01,t tied to any specific
distribution, the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) has less expensive
certification test offerings.

LPI offers basic, advanced and expert levels of Linux certification.
The beginning level certifies users beyond a basic help desk or
power-user level of knowledge. Prerequisites for this course are equal
to the Red Hat program. The second level requires more in-depth study
for people looking for a system administrator=01,s level of certification.
The third level is for certification in more advanced and specialized
areas, such as database server administration or kernel and device
driver development. Each level involves two tests, which cost $100 each
to take. Currently, only the requirements for the first level of the
LPI program have been finalized; requirements for the second and third
levels could change in the near future. LPI=01,s tests are administered
through Virtual University Enterprises=01, 1,700 test centers worldwide.
Among LPI=01,s backers are Caldera, SuSE, Linuxcare, IBM and TurboLinux.

Another option for distribution-neutral Linux certification is the Sair
GNU and Linux Certification program. Similar to the LPI model, the
program offers three levels of certification: Linux Certified
Administrator (LCA) for basic administrative-level certification; Linux
Certified Engineer (LCE) for advanced system managers; and Master Linux
Certified Engineer (MLCE) for senior systems managers. Four tests are
required for each level of certification, with LCA, LCE and MLCE
programs currently available. Certification tests cost $99 each and can
be taken at 2,000 Sylvan Prometric testing centers worldwide.

Today's focus: Get ready for virtual businesses
The ASP model as it is currently formulated is not really viable in the
long run.

Though hosting applications has opened a world of possibilities and
cost savings for end users, application service providers who simply
host applications don=01,t have much to offer. They also have the problem
of being the customer contact. If the network fails and customers can=01,t
access an application, they blame their ASP, not the network provider.

For these reasons, many ASPs are expanding to offer more value, such as
delivering network services along with their applications. Enterprise
Management Associates advocates this approach - but looking to the
future, as analysts are supposed to do, we see a much longer value
chain. Providing other services along with applications is one step up,
but beyond that, we see a huge potential in the virtual space ASPs have
created.

We are already beginning to see pioneering companies exploring the
possibilities. For example, Minnesota company Agiliti is building an
online suite of applications with a consistent front end. This
coordinated suite of business applications is accessed through third-
party partners who provide customer care and support. The value that
Agiliti offers is the integration and maintenance for a complete,
business-enabling software infrastructure. In a sense, this is an
online corporate back office.

As ASPs evolve into full-service providers, more of them will offer
service and support combinations similar to Agiliti=01,s. But what about
the front end of the business, the product development side of things?
We=01,ve found one ASP that has evolved quickly to become a full-service,
front-end infrastructure provider, offering product development,
fabrication and prototyping.

Toolwire, a Silicon Valley start-up, provides a complete, integrated
tool set for electrical engineers. This tool set incorporates state-of-
the-art design and fabrication software, as well as online information
and training in the latest tools and support from various electronic
suppliers and fabricators. Toolwire=01,s vision is to provide a virtual
space where engineers worldwide can collaborate on the design of
advanced electronic devices. Through an extensive partner network,
Toolwire provides not only tools but also collaborative space,
processing power, training and supplier support. In a nutshell, the
company sells a virtual corporation to any entrepreneur with a good
idea. Ultimately, Toolwire expects to expand to incorporate the supply-
and-distribution chain through its site as well.

As e-commerce speeds up, a significant advantage is gained by reducing
the latency involved in delivering new products to market. In the area
of electronics, latency is often due to the acquisition of new tools to
facilitate the design process. Toolwire=01,s approach dramatically reduces
latency for start-ups by eliminating the need to invest in highly
volatile and very expensive design tool sets. Likewise, Agiliti reduces
latency by off-loading the IT infrastructure support from an enterprise.

Breaking new ground, of course, carries with it the problem of
definition. What do you call this new virtual workplace, which combines
all the necessary tools to design, produce, market and deliver a
product without the need for any physical infrastructure? (Agiliti and
Toolwire haven=01,t reached this goal yet, but it is within their sights.)
The label we=01,ve come up with is =01&virtual business service provider.=
=018
This entity transcends the full-service ASP by not only providing
access to the services and applications a company needs but also
actually providing the entire company itself.

Companies like Agiliti and Toolwire are commodifying the enterprise.
The day is coming, very shortly, when an entrepreneur with a good idea
will be able to sit down at a terminal; design a product; ship the
specs to a fabricator; order components; plug into the appropriate
accounting, billing and inventory systems; line up distribution
channels, sales and marketing resources; and obtain financing. And the
entrepreneur will be able to do all that without touching anything more
physical than a keyboard.

Today's focus: Get ready for virtual businesses
The ASP model as it is currently formulated is not really viable in the
long run.

Though hosting applications has opened a world of possibilities and
cost savings for end users, application service providers who simply
host applications don=01,t have much to offer. They also have the problem
of being the customer contact. If the network fails and customers can=01,t
access an application, they blame their ASP, not the network provider.

For these reasons, many ASPs are expanding to offer more value, such as
delivering network services along with their applications. Enterprise
Management Associates advocates this approach - but looking to the
future, as analysts are supposed to do, we see a much longer value
chain. Providing other services along with applications is one step up,
but beyond that, we see a huge potential in the virtual space ASPs have
created.

We are already beginning to see pioneering companies exploring the
possibilities. For example, Minnesota company Agiliti is building an
online suite of applications with a consistent front end. This
coordinated suite of business applications is accessed through third-
party partners who provide customer care and support. The value that
Agiliti offers is the integration and maintenance for a complete,
business-enabling software infrastructure. In a sense, this is an
online corporate back office.

As ASPs evolve into full-service providers, more of them will offer
service and support combinations similar to Agiliti=01,s. But what about
the front end of the business, the product development side of things?

Mark,

Thanks a lot.

Vince - attached is the most recent E&P version of the old corporate cash 
flow model that I could find.  Note that "most recent" still dates it back a 
few years.  A couple caveats:  I did try to clean it up somewhat from old 
macros, but no guarntees offered.  Also, some of the underlying methodology 
is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic 
processes, and perhaps decline rates.  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.

Vasant,

My preference is C, because of its portability. The hardware and operating 
systems
change so fast that we have to use the most flexible
development environment.

Vasant Shanbhogue
04/26/2000 10:03 AM
I have spoken with Bryan Seyfried and Ben Parsons on the issue of  model 
development platform, esp for Credit Trading group.  People besides Ben will 
be modeling in Bryan's group, and C is not a language they know.  One of them 
is coding in MATLAB, and the IT group is doing Visual Basic.  IT prefers not 
to support MATLAB, and would also prefer not to support C, because this would 
make their life easier.  Bryan and Ben need to make a decision as to what is 
the common platform of choice that is best for them, taking IT in mind.  Ben 
has said that if the choice is C, he can enforce everybody learn C, and can 
look into getting some function libraries (if needed).  Similarly, if the 
choice is VB, he can enforce common use of VB.
We need to of course ensure that other members of Research can crosscheck the 
code.
What are your thoughts on C, VB, or MATLAB? 

Vasant

Grant,

It  typically  costs too much time to manage one
of these special situations. We have no time
unless he brings something special to the table.

Vince

   

Vince:

The enclosed is from another of the people in the audience of my Kao 
presentation.  I talked to him, and he seemed slightly  flaky.  However, any 
research he does would be free.  He's looking for direction.  I doubt we 
would want to waste our time and effort on him, but I thought I should send 
this to you on the off chance that you might have a need for such a guy. 
(maybe doing some research for Trish?)

Grant.
Steve J <timely_trader@yahoo.com> on 04/22/2000 10:02:11 PM
Hi Grant,

Thanks for writing.  I have attached my resume and
transcripts for your perusal.

As you can see, my background is not finance.  I became
interested in finance via trading the markets.  So my
research interests initially revolved around the central
concept of trading....pricing, technical type thinking,
insider transactions, volume, and such.  But with exposure,
my interests have grown and I have discovered that I really
enjoy economics.  Also there are many issues in finance
that sound interesting as I am exposed to them.  The point
is, I am too early in my career to set strict limits on my
interests.

My goals are to get introduced to research and to new
ideas, to associate with good people, and to work on
strengthening my weaknesses.  I am interested in starting
to build a network within the field of finance and
especially quantitative finance.  Ultimately, I have to
prepare myself for independent research in order to succeed
in my field.

This brings me to my final point.  Publications are
important for me.  Thus I would want to work on topics that
Enron would be willing to publish.  I would be willing to
work on proprietary models, as long as there was a portion
of the research that could be written up for publication
without jeapordizing the proprietary aspects of the model.

Just to let you know.  I was not in Dr. Kao's energy class.
 I took his stochastic processes class.  Dr. Kao just
mentioned your talk to me as he thought I might be
interested in meeting you and learning more about what is
being done at Enron.

Thanks again.  If you need any more info or want anything
clarified, just write me.

Steve

Today's Focus: Social engineering
Here's an interesting topic that came up in a Butler Group OpinionWire
e-mail newsletter: social engineering.

Instead of using technical skills to break into computers, hackers
often use the weakness of the human mind to gain access to corporations.
Hackers befriend users and trick them into giving away sensitive
information that can be used to gain access to systems. These hackers
also use trickery such as pretending to be from tech support to get
unsuspecting users to give up their username and password information.

Serbian hackers used the technique to gain access to Web sites
registered by Network Solutions, Inc., according to the Butler Group.
The hackers then defaced these sites as a form of political and social
protest.

While no data was stolen, the incidents bring up an interesting point.
While you may have security in place, it is still important to educate
users on security practices, such as never giving passwords or other
sensitive information out to unknown people or Web sites. AOL warns its
users all the time that administrators do not ask for password
information when dealing with customers.

Make sure your employees aren't unwittingly leaving the front door open
to attack.

One other note before we get to the latest alerts. Last week, a brain
cramp had me misreading information about the alleged backdoor
passwords in Microsoft software. The problem is associated with
InterDev 1.0, not Version 7.0 as previously reported. Also, I was
remiss in not mentioning that Microsoft recommends deleting the
DVWSSR.DLL library that installs as part of a number of Web software
applications, including FrontPage 98 Extensions. The library could be
used in buffer overflow attacks.

Now on with the latest patches and alerts:

Panda Software warns of W95/CIH virus

W95/CIH (or Chernobyl) is set to go active on April 26, the anniversary
of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. The virus infects various
executables with 1K byte of code, and on the 26th is set to destroy the
Flash BIOS of Intel Pentium processors, rendering the computer useless
until the Flash BIOS is restored to its original settings.

Microsoft releases procedure to eliminate  "Server-Side Image Map
Components" vulnerability

A vulnerability in several Web server products from Microsoft could let
a malicious Web site visitor perform actions that the system
permissions allow, but could not have been accessed without this hole.
The risk is in FrontPage 97 and 98 extensions htimage.exe and
imagemap.exe, which provide server-side image-mapping support.
Microsoft says the affect of this bug is limited, but the company is
providing a means of remedying the situation.
For more information on the procedure:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-028.asp
**********

Buffer overflow in Red Hat's imwheel module

A buffer overflow condition in the imwheel module that comes with Red
Hat Powertools could allow a local user to execute arbitrary commands
as root.
For more information:
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/
**********

Red Hat releases new openldap packages

The new openldap package fixes a vulnerability in Red Hat Linux
Versions 6.1 and 6.2. The old version of the package creates a link to
the /tmp directory that is world writable. This could allow users to
destroy any file on a mounted file system.
For more information:
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla
**********

RealNetworks releases patch for denial-of-service vulnerability in
RealServer

RealNetworks' RealServer streaming media server contains a
vulnerability that could allow a malicious user to cause a stack
overflow and shut down the system until it is rebooted by an
administrator. RealNetworks says the problem lies in the PNA
protocol-handling scheme.
Download the patch:
http://service.real.com/help/faq/servg270.html
**********

Bug in Netscape Navigator could allow others to view bookmarks

A flaw has been discovered in Netscape Navigator that could allow a
malicious Web site operator to view a person's bookmark file. By using
a combination of JavaScripts, cookies and frames, an operator could
view the contents of a bookmark file, if the browser user is set to
"default." Also, support for cookies and JavaScript needs to be turned
on. The problem could be part of Microsoft Internet Explorer as well.
While no code can be run on the client machine, the problem could
expose private information in the bookmark file.
http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,2553337,00.html
**********

Patch available for "Malformed Environment Variable" vulnerability

A vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 could allow a
malicious user to make some or all of the memory on a server
unavailable, effectively slowing and shutting down the machine. The
CMD.EXE command processor has an unchecked buffer in part of the code
that handles environment strings. Microsoft does not believe this to be
a major threat.
For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-027.asp
**********

Patch available for "Mixed Object Access" vulnerability

Microsoft scores the hat trick with its third vulnerability of the
week. This patch fixes a limited problem in Windows NT 4.0 and 2000
that could allow a user to change information in Active Directory
without permission. The scope of the problem is very small and only
pertains to certain object attributes.

WM97/Astia-AI reported in the wild by Sophos

Many people like to write these Word macro viruses. For hackers, these
must be the equivalent of the little Pascal programs that sorted simple
lists, which I had to write back in my early days as a computer science
major. Hackers must start with these viruses before jumping to the big
leagues of distributed-denial-of-service attacks. This particular
strain creates Book.dot and Book.src files in the Word StartUp
directory and affects the Normal.dot file. The virus will pop up a
window titled "TITANUS" if a user enters the Visual Basic Macro Editor.
It will then attempt to infect an open document. Just another pain to
be aware of.
For more information:
http://www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/wm97astiaai.html
**********

Georgi Guninski reports another IE problem

Georgi Guninski is the king of finding bugs in Microsoft Internet
Explorer. This time, Guninski has found an error in the way Microsoft
implements its Java Virtual Machine that could circumvent the cross-
frame security policy built into the browser. This could allow
malicious users to use the Document Object Model to gain access to
files on a vulnerable machine. Guninski reports that fixing the problem
is not as easy as turning off Active Scripting.
For a demonstration of the problem:
http://www.nat.bg/~joro/jsinject.html
**********

Problem with Panda Security 3.0

DeepZone is reporting a problem with Panda Security 3.0's key handling.
Local users could override their privileges and gain access to
administrator rights. This could allow an unauthorized user to
uninstall the product.
For more information and patches:

**********

Denial-of-service problem with some versions of Cisco IOS

A defect in multiple Cisco IOS software versions will cause a Cisco
router to reload unexpectedly when the router is tested for security
vulnerabilities by security scanning software programs. The defect can
be exploited repeatedly to produce a consistent denial-of-service
attack. Cisco recommends upgrading affected systems as soon as possible.

Libsafe 1.3 stack protection software

Some engineers at Bell Labs and MandrakeSoft have developed software
for preventing "smash attacks" against the network stack of a Linux box.
The software is said to prevent attackers from smashing the return
address and taking control of the flow of a running program.

Alcatel and Funk team to tighten LAN security

Alcatel is making it possible to keep unauthorized LAN users out of
resources they shouldn't be using with a security package from Funk
Software. The package uses Remote Authentication Dial-In User service

Steve,

I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a 
presentation on Enron
(for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.

I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The 
industry
does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its
flexibility).

I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow
and send it to you.

Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start
showing up).

Vince

Lenos got back to me, and said he'd prefer a high-level overview of real 
options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants 
me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.

Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and 
I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date 
have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I 
obviously don't have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get 
the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.

If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely:
1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation;
2. Gas storage;
3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.

I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we 
prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I haven't used AMC myself up 
till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price 
curve scenarios being run through.

I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach 
- people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and 
they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my "Real Options 
Strategy" document.

Cheers,
Steve

Darrell,

I am sending you 2 technical notes on Enron default swaps: I hope that they 
will
be useful. I shall read the articles on weekend. I am curious if you
find these explanations satisfactory.

We are very slow in preparing a number of technical documents
for you for model reviews. We still hope you will be able
to find some time to review our credit models (for our London
credit trading) and  VaR and option pricing related models.

Also, please check your invoices. I still think we owe you money.

Vince
 

Darrell Duffie <duffie@stanford.edu> on 03/28/2001 08:07:38 AM
Vince: According to a Bank of America
publication, your (Enron) default swap spreads
are consistently trading about 80
basis points wider than your asset swaps.
Any idea of what is going on here?

Thanks for any guidance, Darrell

Dear Vince,

Firstly, I really appreciate your time and our meeting last week.  Learning
about Enron's use of leading-edge practices was quite enlightening and I
truly benefited from our visit.

Secondly, I've summarized my key "take-aways" as stated below.  Before
conveying it to my management, however, I really appreciate it if you can
pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss-stated.

Again, thanks so much for your time and wisdom.  I was also honored that you
gave me a copy of the "Managing Energy Price Risk" book and shall reference
it with interest.  THANK YOU.

I really look forward to seeing you again next time I'm in Houston.

Best regards,
Soussan

PS.  The latest Fortune article on ENE is a great read and substantiates the
company's innovative and creative approach to business.
Our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re
leading-edge practices within ENE.  My key findings are summarized below:

1. ENE does not use corporate price premises.  They use market price info
only and adhere to mark-to-market accounting.
2. ENE uses the "Heath, Jarrow, and Morton" methods for modeling price
dynamics (I've asked BIC for a copy of the associated paper).  They have
their own "home-grown" software, however, they periodically review selected
external developments for internal inclusion and advancement.
3. Vince's group comprises of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Operations
Researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of ENE's
risk management tools.  These models are religiously used by the traders,
risk managers, and BUs across ENE.
4. Investment proposals are screened, risked, and "ROVed" by a separate
corporate group (similar to our Special Studies and with business and real
options skills) who work in conjunction with the BUs.  All evaluations and
transactions are marked-to-market.
5. ENE does not use efficient-frontier portfolio concepts.  They "VC fund"
any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its
own.  They believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market,
project-financing in not an issue for a "good" opportunity.  However, they
closely monitor the development of each opportunity, within their deep
portfolio, at the corporate level and know how to "fail fast".
6. The employee reward system is based on P&Ls as well as the creation of
new business.
7. Most employees have stock options.

I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next time
I'm in Houston.

Soussan,

It looks fine.
Look forward to meeting you again in Houston or New York.

The person I was dealing with (Shan Millie) passed on my paper to her=20

article in Risk's "Game Choices" real options book, which is being publishe=

in June, along with a summary version for the magazine.

I'm supposed to be waiting for them to get back to me, and it's not been at=
=20
the front of my mind until now.  I think I'll chase them up.

Interestingly at a recent Risk course Phelim Boyle expressed an interest in=
=20
my work to appear in one the the journals he edits, I think it's Decision=
=20
Science or something like that.  Do you think this would be a more=20
appropriate home for the work?

One more thing that may be of interest to you is that I've now worked forwa=
rd=20
recursive DP into my notation too.  It's simply a matter of putting the=20
decision nodes on the left hand side of the value symbols!

Should I chase Risk, or pursue the peer reviewed Phelim Boyle option?

                    Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a 
generation of
                    consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they 
claim, requires
                    new principles of valuation. 

                    C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in 
business-to-business
                    commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market - 
annual sales by 2010
                    are likely to be Dollars 500,000bn. If C.com can maintain 
a 5 per cent share
                    and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective 
annual earnings will be
                    Dollars 250bn. 

                    If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent 
and discount future
                    revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com 
is Dollars 5,000bn -
                    about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of 
Microsoft, Cisco or General
                    Electric. 

                    You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in 
C.com right now for
                    less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called 
Citigroup and in addition to
                    its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I 
have described, you get
                    its other wholesale, retail and investment banking 
activities and a leading
                    insurance company thrown in. 

                    Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value 
Citigroup in this way. Yet I
                    have followed more or less exactly the methodology 
recommended in the
                    latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era 
companies. They use
                    precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation 
of Dollars 37bn for
                    Amazon.com. 

                    Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at 
J.P. Morgan, recently
                    used similar principles to confirm that assessment of 
Amazon. He then
                    performed the same calculation for internet service 
provider Freeserve. 

                    Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year, 
that 25 per cent of
                    sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per 
cent of these, that
                    Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and 
maintains an 8 per cent
                    commission on sales. Multiply these together and you 
establish that in 2017
                    Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn). 
This, he argues, justifies a
                    value today of o6.50 per share. 

                    But I prefer T.com to Freeserve. T.com has a customer 
base four times larger
                    than Freeserve. Its franchise is stronger. Its customers 
are concentrated in
                    the affluent south-east of England, where it faces 
virtually no competition.
                    Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its 
customers use its
                    essential services every day, many of them several times 
a day. 

                    T.com also has ambitious plans for expansion. At present, 
its geographical
                    coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in 
England and Wales. T.com
                    has an interest in south-east Asia. The population of 
China is 100 times the
                    number of people who today can access T.com services. 
Even after the recent
                    market correction, T.com, better known as Thames Water, 
still has a market
                    valuation below that of Freeserve. At the widest point 
between the old and new
                    economies, Freeserve was worth four times as much. 

                    The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is 
simple, but fundamental.
                    The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary 
widely. If you buy
                    small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much 
wider than 1 per
                    cent. If you are a large corporation trading major 
currencies, the margin is
                    wafer thin. Entry and competition force prices down to 
the related costs. 

                    In Mr Gibbs's model, Freeserve earns profits of o2bn, 
about equal to the
                    current profits of Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Marks and 
Spencer together. And it
                    earns these on revenues of only o2.5bn, so that profits 
are 80 per cent of the
                    value of its sales. No established business earns margins 
of that size. 

                    Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose 
market position is
                    so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if 
it charged five times the
                    current price we would have little choice but to pay. We 
do have one option -
                    to insist the government intervenes. It confines Thames 
Water to a return on
                    its capital employed of about 6 per cent. 

                    The idea that profit is a return on capital invested 
still has some role in new
                    economy valuation, at the level of the overall market. 

                    There is a key formula in the new math. The required 
yield on a security is
                    equal to the difference between the rate of return 
demanded from that class of
                    securities and its expected rate of growth. So, if you 
expect a return of 5.5 per
                    cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per 
cent, calculations show
                    that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent. 

                    This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin 
Hassett in their
                    book Dow 36,000*. Claiming that sustainable dividends 
average half of
                    earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of 
100 - implying a target
                    of 36,000 for the US index. 

                    The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to 
produce what the
                    investor is looking for. Investors will receive only 
two-fifths of the cash
                    sustaining the valuation this century. One-third of the 
total depends on
                    dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200. 

                    Two hundred years ago, well before the Dow Jones average, 
prudent,
                    diversified investors would have owned slave traders and 
sugar plantations, or
                    perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new 
economy -a canal.
                    The next 200 years may be more stable than the last and 
Microsoft and Cisco
                    may prove more enduring than plantations. But we can 
hardly be sure. 

                    While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the 
growth rate of
                    dividends in the US economy as a whole, it is likely that 
well before 2200
                    most of these will come from companies not yet founded. 

                    Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett's protests that 
their dividend
                    growth expectations are conservative. If you raise them 
only from 5 per cent to
                    5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the Dow Jones 
average is 72,000. At
                    5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares 
of US companies
                    are infinitely valuable. Not even the most credulous 
dotcom investor believes
                    that. 

                    The math also works in reverse. If expectations of return 
are 6 per cent rather
                    than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and 
the value of the Dow
                    Jones from 36,000 to 18,000. And if equity investors 
require a return of 8 per
                    cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth 
only half their current
                    level. 

                    An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for 
an equity investor. A
                    day trader might think you were talking about a weekly 
profit rather than
                    annual. Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5.5 
per cent - the return
                    on Treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have 
so consistently
                    outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated 
with equity
                    investment. In other words, because equities are sure to 
offer higher returns
                    than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the 
same as on bonds. 

                    You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw. The 
rules of logic hold
                    even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of 
economics. Profits are hard to
                    earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not 
competitive are
                    usually regulated. The value of companies ultimately 
depends on their
                    capacity to generate cash for shareholders. Distant 
returns are uncertain.
                    Share prices are volatile, and investors need to be 
compensated for the risks.
                    These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old. 

                    By all means do the math. Isaac Newton, who could do the 
math better than
                    most, gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in 
the South Sea Bubble.
                    In addition to the math, you need the econ, the pol, and 
perhaps the
                    psychology.

Clayton,

 my thought is that you should attend the presentation, because it is our 
responsibility to ensure that the groups have the best model available.  Try 
to gauge how well the model backtests (is it just another academic model?), 
and what are the sources of data.  Do not elaborate on your model -- your 
story is that you have the responsibility to analyze economic models of this 
sort in the Research Group.

Vasant-

This guy Mark Breese called Thursday, (a Manager in "Long Term") saying there 
would be a presentation to their group of this commercial model of his 
just-ex employer, and I called him back and said I'd wait to hear from you or 
Vince before attending. I told him I was finishing my model, that Vince 
hadn't decided what we had, that Vince would tell his group what we had, and 
that I was uncomfortable attending these kinds of presentations right now 
because I wasn't clear what all of the agendas were (he's obviously pimping 
for the company he just worked for).

Clayton

Rick,

Aram is coming to Houston, in my view, to explore the possibility of coming 
back to Enron
(given uncertain situation under the Scottish rule at the old Pacificorp). 

I shall suggest that he meet  with you and/or Ted Murphy as well.

I can wait for Karen to come back. It's not urgent. We are still working on
the volumetric  risk module and the team is making a very good progress.
They gave a  presentation today to Rick Carson and me.

We have to decide what comes next  (Asset/Liability Model or
Operational Risk Model).

Vince

Shirley,
Please, put on my schedule.

Dear Vince,

Attached please find an updated resume of mine.

I have been continuing my research in the area of pricing, risk management
and asset management of power industry.  It seems to me that the framework I
have been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues and
allows describing the salient features of power markets.  I feel a brief
info may inform you what have I been up to.

Conceptually speaking, my approach relies on the understudying that the
absence of cash and carry implies non-hedgibility of the most fundamental
building blocks of power market - forward contracts of hourly duration.
This clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices.  I have been
able to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium, and calculate its
impact on pricing of other products.  In particular, the method allows
consistent generation of hourly forward curve (per each geographic region),
hence generation of forward curves of longer duration.  It provides us not
only with forward curves, but also their physical (not risk-neutral)
distribution.  It also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forward
curve with respect to the volumetric risk.  As a fundamental  input ,  I
consider the ratio of properly compounded generation output (load) and the
corresponding maximum available generation supply.  The first one is well
observable and forecastable due to its stationarity.  The second one  is
defined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of the
region.  Much of the required information is in the public domain.

The market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio and
the calendar time.  This time dependence of the market price of risk allows
capturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time, and its
dependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and the
reality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply higher
compensation do the investors expect.

I have also realized that the transmission related factors may be
incorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner.

This approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochastic
process dependent on the volumetric factors, among other things.  It allows
posing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keeping
their variance under control in a very elegant and robust way.

I have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototype
software reflecting all these issues.  My inability to complete this program
has been resulted from the severe instability, lack of access and the cash
flow problems I have experienced in the last few years.  I have also
understood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the
"grandpa's garage."

Nevertheless, I think I have developed a very systematic and robust
understanding and methodology, and at least, I have convinced myself that
this approach leads to a comprehensive system.

With all this said, I don't want to make an impression of a stiff person,
who has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push it
forward.  I have always been very flexible, and in my consulting experience,
I have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients.  In my short
period of employment with Altra I have been very ethical, I have played by
the rules, I have done whatever I have been asked to do, and have been a
team player.  The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to do
with me personally.  They have been respectful to me, they have valued me as
capable person, but have found that given the direction of the company
(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), "further
Altra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go."  It was almost
formulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.
As an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,
something that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to its
end, too.  I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation from
Altra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.
corporate style, etc.  I have no doubts that I can function equally well in
either environment.

I wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that my
joining Enron becomes a possibility.

Martin

team player.  The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to do
with me personally.  They have been respectful to me, they have valued me as
capable person, but have found that given the direction of the company
(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), "further
Altra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go."  It was almost
formulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.
As an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,
something that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to its
end, too.  I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation from
Altra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.
corporate style, etc.  I have no doubts that I can function equally well in
either environment.

I wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that my
joining Enron becomes a possibility.

Regards,
Martin

Tony,

Earl Harvey and I are located on the 19th floor inside the Corporate Research
Group's area, which is in a secured area.  They are a very supportive and
cooperative group, and conditions here are ideal for research, analysis, and
writing.  I don't want to jeopardize their security in any way, but, if
possible, I would like to be added to the after hours and weekend access list
for situations such as meeting deadlines and research & development.

The Research Group's director is Vince Kaminski (Ext. 3-3848) and Shirley
Crenshaw (Ext. 3-5290) is the group's administrative coordinator.  Their
security procedures require that Mr. Kaminski authorize Shirley to add people 
to
the access list.  If you concur with my request, could you please extend the
request to Mr. Kaminski?

I have discussed my request with Shirley and am copying her with this memo, 
but
I didn't want to copy Mr. Kaminski because I believe that you would see that 
as
your responsibility; and that if you did not concur with my request, then 
there
would be no reason to copy him at all.

Thanks,

JAY

Grant,

Let's invite him for a preliminary interview.

Vince

   

Vince, Stinson:

I gave a talk to a bunch of UH MBA students taking a course on options.  One 
of the more interesting of the inevitable stream of resumes is the enclosed. 
Perhaps an EBS hire?

Grant
Dr. Masson,

I attended your lecture at UH and enjoyed it tremendously.  If possible, I
would like to investigate a career opportunity with your group in particular
or Enron in general.  Would you please review my resume and/or forward to
potentially interested parties?

In tandem will all of Enron's other propaganda efforts, your top-notch
lecture at UH spurred me to do some soul searching.  I currently work at
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, but have been extremely impressed with
Enron's cutting-edge research and market-leading position.

I have a Ph.D in electrical engineering from Rice (statistical signal
processing) with two years of experience at Duke relating to the valuation,
risk management, and risk measurement of financial derivatives and physical
assets.  I seek a similar position that would allow me to leverage my
quantitative skills and grow within in the corporation.

I believe I would be a great fit with Enron and hope you would consider me
for a potential position.

Best regards,
Matt Crouse

Van,

Thanks for your message. We are taking a  number of interns this summer,  but 
the A&A
program has closed the books for this year. We were able to reopen the list
to add one candidate a few weeks ago, but cannot do it again. We promised it 
would be the last addition.

Vince

Van Ngo <vngo@rice.edu> on 04/23/2000 11:42:54 AM
Dear Vince, 

I'm writing to let you know that I have been in touch with Christy Young from 
the A&A Program and will be finding out my assignment for this summer soon.? 
I am very excited to be back at Enron, and I hope to see the Research team 
again. 

I'd also like to inquire about summer positions within Research.? Will the 
Research group be taking on another intern this summer?? Since I know there 
is no busier place at Enron than the Research Group, if there is a position 
available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open 
for consideration, I would love to connect you to another Rice student. 

Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this 
summer.? If so, I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone, a 
senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with 
both his B.S. and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May.? Brad has 
gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years.? His 
academic focus gives him a strong mathematical, quantitative background and 
excellent computer skills.? I believe his skills are transferable and 
relevant to the Group, and he is a deeply dedicated individual.? If the 
Research Group is looking for a summer intern, I hope it will continue 
Enron's strong support and recruit of Rice University students. 

Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion. (As I 
realize the summer months are not far off, if it is easier, an arrangement 
through ProStaff may be made similar to my work extension at the end of last 
summer).? I have attached a copy of his resume for your review.? Brad will be 
in Houston this summer.? His contact information is given below. 

James Bradley (Brad) Aimone 
6320 Main, Houston, TX? 77005

imaknee@rice.edu 
? 

Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.? I sincerely 
hope that you will have the opportunity to discover the contributions Brad 
can make to the Research Group.? I certainly know that he would gain 
tremendously from the experience as I did last summer. 

Thank you very much for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Van

My column

Vince

Hi Vince,
?
I was wondering how the chapter of the book is coming along??! Do you want  
me to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?
?
Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have been 
throwing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk's 'Energy 
and Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would 
write an article a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy 
modelling and energy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles 
would be based upon sections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to 
reduce the effort/time involved by using?already produced material.  We would 
like to cover some very practical topics, but we?won't be giving  too much 
away as the articles are only 1 or 2 pages long.
?
Each article would be of?the  form;
?
- introduce?the concept
- give an example using real data
- discuss the problem with a case study?  
- provide a discussion
- sum up
?
I've included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. For 
example, for the first one,  "Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy 
prices", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of 
an equity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate 
the parameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and 
finally, discuss the  results.
?
We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Your 
involvement needn't take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind of 
input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?review 
the list of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, 
suggest reasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, 
and then to run your eye over  "near finished" articles, which?we would 
supply to you for  your?practical experience?input.? Would something like 
this  interest you? If it did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a 
regular  monthly "feature" of EPRM, authored by all three of us.
?
We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks, so 
please let us know if you are interested.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
?
?
Potental EPRM articles;
?
1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parameters 
estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over  different seasons)
?
2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated for 
oil, gas, and electricity data over different  seasons)
?
3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energy 
derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)
?
4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energy 
derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)
?
5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for 
pricing energy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot 
electricity)
?
6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spot 
price model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the 
Forward curve and volatlity structure)
?
7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swing 
options
?
8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices 
and variation of parameters thru time
?
9- adding jump volatility to the tree
?
10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forward 
curve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and a 
discussion on the differences between the two  approaches)
?
11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models 
(with estimates of oil data over different  periods)
?
12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model 
from market option prices
?
13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise 
strategy
?
14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativ 
portfolio.

GPCM Modelers,
Here's an article from Powermarketers.com regarding a recent IPAA short-run
forecast.  Note that the title is wrong.  The information in the article
implies a year 2001 22.56 tcf total US consumption not output (production).
 And, that consumption includes pipeline fuel and lease and plant fuel.
 Production in 2001 is est at 18.94 tcf (not sure whether marketed or dry,
but probably dry.)
It could be an interesting point of comparison for your own near term
forecasts.

Hi Vince,

Can you e-mail me your mailing address in Houston and I will send you a hard
copy of the above today.  Apologies for delay, but I wanted to ensure that
Les Clewlow had received his copy in Sydney before distributing any other
copies.

Incidentally, today (March 27th) is a red letter day in the UK as the NETA /
new electricity trading arrangements have gone 'live'.  Should be
interesting to observe the development of the paper market in the coming
months - you're no doubt aware that IPE have just launched an electricity
futures contract.

Regards

Bernard

Bernard,

Yes, I can  read a DVI file. You can also  cc
my home address: Vkaminski@aol.com. I shall
try to send you an answer to your question on weekend.

Vince

Vince,

I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read
SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or
the
External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the
Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to
both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time
to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly
implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options -
rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a
rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be
made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.

In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and
essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :

1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is "incomplete"
(synthesising
the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) -
note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with
'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and
Das and;

2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the
price
of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth
process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of
CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).

Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done
much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation
framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded
optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward
gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion
and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of
out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a
pure-diffusion
framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available
market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve
for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition
means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility
function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

Regards

Bernard

Bernard,

I am forwarding your message to my assistant and she will mail you a
reprint.
I would be glad to take a look at your dissertation. Is it available as a
publication, working paper?

Vince

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les
Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at
Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at
University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Today's focus: Intellectual property and ASPs
The deeper we get into the e-business paradigm, the more concerns we
discover.

The other day, we were talking to a manager at a large
telecommunications company who was anxious over the contractual
arrangements for an electronic-business relationship her company is
developing. Specifically, she was worried about the protection of
intellectual property in such an arrangement.

Intellectual property - or IP, as it is known to lawyers - refers to
copyrights, patents and trade secrets upon which your company depends
for its competitive advantage. In short, it=01,s anything you don=01,t want
your competitors to get their hands on. It can also include intangibles
such as goodwill from current customers.

How is IP put at risk in an application service provider (ASP)
relationship? In any ASP arrangement, a customer is forced to disclose
intellectual property to one degree or another. The property may be
simple business plans or proprietary customer information. In any event,
it is information that could do a great deal of harm if it were leaked
to competitors or the universe at large. In the case of full-service
ASPs (those that provide integration and Web design services), IP can
also include the look and feel of the business in e-space.

The problem is trust. An ASP must convince its customers that their
information is secure. But how does an ASP even know what information
needs to be protected? Customers must retain full rights to their
intellectual property and ensure that it is secure from disclosure.

The most effective way for a customer to secure IP rights and
obligations is through a contract that clearly states who owns what.
Just like a prenuptial agreement, both parties go into the arrangement
with rights and property. It is important to get these on paper prior
to the business relationship. And this contract is different from a
service-level agreement SLA). While the SLA is a performance document,
the business relationship contract is one of rights and responsibilities.

This also applies to the look and feel of the business. If an ASP
develops a Web presence for a customer that provides a unique advantage
to that customer, it is essential that the customer get its IP rights
in writing. One peculiarity of the IP world is that unless you
specifically say something to the contrary, the creator of the IP is
the owner.

The guidance Enterprise Management Associates always gives is: when in
doubt, write it down. If it offends the other party, at least you know
where the sensibilities are. If it doesn=01,t, then that tells you
something as well. In any case, having an obligation or right expressed
on paper establishes a point of reference if things get fuzzy in the
day-to-day ASP operation.

As our telco manager friend noted, many things are uncertain in the new
e-business world we are creating. She is right. But we will be more
confident as we proceed if we remember that the obligations of good
business practice have not changed.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH
on LINUX
Today's focus: Getting embedded with a penguin
04/19/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Announcing FREE, LIVE webcast with John 
Gallant!

Introducing, "The Networked World," a FREE monthly webcast that
features Network World's John Gallant going head-to-head with network
industry movers and shakers. Premieres May 5 at 1:00 p.m. ET. Register

Today's focus: Getting embedded with a penguin
Linux may be red-hot as a server operating system, but it's also
creating some heat in the embedded operating system market.

Developers have been putting Linux on small devices and cramming the
operating system into a space the size of a SIMM for some time, but
embedded versions of the operating system are on the verge of coming to
mainstream devices, such as slimmed-down Internet clients, handheld
devices and network appliances.

One of the major markets for embedded Linux systems lies in e-business
and enterprise networks. Last fall, Red Hat bought Cygnus Solutions,
which develops embedded Linux tools and embedded operating systems,
creating the biggest open-source company in the world. The merger
brought together the Red Hat development team's expertise in the
operating system (they are the leading Linux distribution company) and
the unique gadget-related technology of Cygnus, such as its embedded
configurable operating system (eCos), embedded Linux tools and
application programming interfaces.

Last month, Red Hat began offering eCos as its own product, coinciding
with the release of Red Hat Linux 6.2. Red Hat is banking on Linux to
emerge as the standard technology in enterprise handheld and server
connectivity. The leaders in server and handheld operating system
development are currently Microsoft and Palm Computing, but Red Hat
proclaims that having the same core operating system running on the
front and back ends of these post-PC, wireless handheld network
environments will lead to better performance and scalability. With
Linux running on the client and the server, business applications will
come to market more quickly as software can be written once for server
applications, then only slightly modified for compatibility for the
wireless handheld client, Red Hat says.

Lineo, of Lindon, Utah, has also made strides in embedded Linux
technology development recently. Lineo currently offers its own
embedded Linux distribution, Embedex, in addition to the Embedex
Browser - an embedded, graphical user interface-based microbrowser
and a software development kit. The Embedex operating system, browser
and development kit are aimed at the handheld and information appliance
markets. Lineo is currently compatible with X86 and PowerPC processors
and runs on less than 4M bytes of RAM and 2M bytes of read-only memory
or flash memory. The company last week announced a new development
partnership with MIPS Technologies, so look for embedded Linux running
on the MIPS architecture in the near future.

Also on the embedded bandwagon is Pennsylvania company Neoware Systems,
which just announced its NeoLinux embedded Linux distribution based on
Red Hat's Linux distribution. The company is offering NeoLinux for
small handheld devices but is focusing more on "information
appliances" - that is, network devices dedicated to a single task such
as firewalls, routers and security devices. To complement its own Linux
distribution, Neoware has also released its own hardware to run
NeoLinux - the Eon Anything Box - which lets users configure the
hardware to act as a variety of network devices.

With all these various flavors of embedded Linux sprouting up, embedded
system and network device companies recently formed an industry board
to help the technology's development. Created in March, the Embedded
Linux Consortium (ELC) - http://www.embedded-linux.org - comprises over
two dozen companies that specialize in embedded system hardware,
software and Linux, including Red Hat, Motorola and IBM. The goal of
the group is to spur "the advancement of Linux-based solutions in
embedded applications," the ELC says.

As information appliances, thin servers and handheld devices become
more prevalent in the enterprise, it appears that Linux will be a big
part of the post-PC networking era. As a result, network managers will
need to become more familiar with what makes these embedded devices
tick and with trends in the embedded Linux industry.

Hi,
I'd like to make a personal invitation to you to attend RDI's annual user
conference at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, just north of San Diego.  We are
planning two sessions for GPCM users (and prospective users) which I think
you will find very interesting and useful.  Plus we are also going to
schedule individual sessions for those that would like them, as was quite
successful last year.  The details are included in the attached Word file
below.  I've also included the program in pdf format.  The last page is a
signup form you can fill out and fax in to RDI if you haven't already done
so.
Please let me and Mike know how many are coming from your team.  You can
reply to this e-mail to let us know.
Looking forward to seeing you there.
I think it's going to be fun.

Dear Friends of the Institute for Energy Economics and Policy

The attached power point presentation "Oil and Gas Markets: Myth and Reality"
was given today to a major luncheon (April 18th)  meeting of the American
Association for Petroleum Geology Annual Conference in New Orleans.  The
presentation looks at current oil and gas markets during the last year and
the next twelve months.

IEEP makes occasional papers, research, and analysis available to the friends
and supporters.  This work asks the question of whether current prices are
sustainable and examines the impact of weather and non market factors on the
market.  If you would like to know more about our efforts to develop EWxAS,
our analytical and risk managment product, please contact us.

I thought you might find the attached presentation interesting and perhaqps

Margaret,

First of all I apologize for not sending you the information to complete the 
chart that you gave me.  I have been travelling because of work and then 
vacation, maybe I spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4 
weeks.  Now that I am going through my to do list I cannot find that page 
that you gave me .  Could you  please send it to me again?

On the other hand I was wondering if maybe within Enron possibly at Info 
Central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a 
copy of a book titled:                   Chicago Board of Trade Commodity 
Trading Manual 
                      ISBN: 1579580025
                      Publisher: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Incorporated
                      Pub. Date: December  1997
 It si not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long 
time to deliver.   I need this bbok in order to produce a document that Steve 
Kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago.

Thank you very much for your help.

Please, give him my phone number/E-mail address

Vince

Dear Vince,

A faculty member in our department, namely Dr. Keith Baggerly,
 is interested in pursuing other employment. He is currently an
assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member  of
our department. We hate to lose him, however his interest has shifted
from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application
and development of statistical methodologies including
stochastic modeling.

Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the same
group of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at Los
Alamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He has
been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation
(and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receive
tenure.

Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background
to support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statistical
computing, empirical likelihood, categorical models and areas
of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of "data mining".
He is a creative thinker.

I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group,
however
I believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.  Would you
have an interest in speaking with Keith? If so, I will suggest that he
contact you.

Best regards,

Kathy Ensor

Steve,

I shall talk to Anjam about it. Our impression here in Houston is that Thomas 
is quite qualified 
and we are very interested in him. A few days will not make much difference 
in the hiring process.

Vince

Steven Leppard

Dale, Vince

As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a 
result of Prof Lane Hughston's recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of 
Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).  
Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was "too old and too 
experienced".  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to 
have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview 
process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  I'm 
somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it 
seems he's trying to put up barriers to these interviews.

I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he 
recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call 
from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking 
how he got his CV into Enron (I'd shown Anjam the email and CV back in early 
February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was 
contacting him at that moment).

Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking 
Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working day's notice).  
Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that 
he'd have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things 
at work.  He said he'd contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his 
availability.

Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn't make it, and that 
he wouldn't be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought, 
given that we're losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the 
position might be filled in two weeks' time.

Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didn't even realise 
it was leaving so soon!

Can anyone shed any light on this?

Shirley,

No problem.

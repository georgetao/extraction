Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six
days.
Eventually, Michael the archangel found him, resting on the seventh
day.
He inquired of God, "Where have you been?"
God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards
through the clouds, "Look Michael, look what I've made."
Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, "What is it?"

"It's a planet," replied God, "and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to
call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."
"Balance?" inquired Michael, still confused.

God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth, "For example,
Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while
Southern
Europe is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot
spot.
Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a
continent of black people,"
God continued, pointing to different countries. "This one will be
extremely
hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice."
The Archangel, impressed by Gods work, then pointed to a large landmass

in the top corner and asked, "What's that one?"
"Ah," said God. "That's Canada, the most glorious place on Earth.
There are beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, streams and an exquisite
coastline.
The people from Canada are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous
and
they're going to be found traveling the world. They'll be extremely
sociable, hard working and high achieving, and they will be known
throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace. I'm also going
to give
them super-human, undefeatable ice hockey players who will be admired
and
feared by all who come across them."

Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed; "What
about balance, God? You said there will be BALANCE!"
God replied wisely. "Wait until you see the loud-mouthed obnoxious
idiots I'm putting next to them...."

This is a simple psychoanalytic test to measure your memory. 
Open the first superman picture. 
Memorize it and open the second. 
Without reopening the first try to note each of the differences between the 
two pictures.  There are at least three.  If you can find five or more, you 
are of above average intelligence.

I like number 6. I should put a sign on my desk that says that.

    1. Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again... 
      2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to 
pronounce. 
      3. How about never? Is never good for you? 
      4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in 
public. 
      5. I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to worship 
me. 
      6. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. 
      7. I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message... 
      8. I don't work here. I'm a consultant. 
      9. It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're 
saying. 
      10. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of crap. 
      11. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid. 
      12. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. 
      13. I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a damn. 
      14. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
      15. I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. 
      16. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely 
coincidental. 
      17. What am I? Flypaper for freaks!? 
      18. I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. 
      19. It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off. 
      20. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. 
      21. And your cry baby whiny-ass opinion would be...? 
      22. Do I look like a people person? 
      23. This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. 
      24. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left. 
      25. Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. 
      26. If I throw a stick, will you leave? 
      27. Errors have been made. Others will be blamed. 
      28. Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. 
      29. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
      30. A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. 
      31. Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? 
      32. Too many freaks, not enough circuses. 
      33. Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it? 
      34. Chaos, panic, & disorder -- my work here is done. 
      35. How do I set a laser printer to stun? 
      36. I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted pay checks. 
      37. Your village just called..... their idiot is missing.

Chris buddy!  How's it going?  I was chatting with Dan this morning and
I was able to track down your mailing address, so I can send you a
wedding invitation.  You're still M.C. right?  Just kidding, but it'll
be good to see you.  I hear everything's going good down there, speaking
for the rest of your buddies up north though, I'll be looking forward to
when that career path steers you back a little closer to home.  The
wedding is on August 18th(saturday), Mike & Nate are planning some golf,
camping and a little drinking as well on the August long weekend too if
you were planning on being back then as well, although that sounds like
a lot of travel.  Anyways, I suppose II'll see you at Sue and Dionne's
wedding?  Should be a good time.  Take it easy, Chris.

Matt Engelhardt

TJ,

This has something to do with my cell bill. Can you make sure it got paid.

Jackie,

I'm glad you made it through another Dancentral production. All is going we=
ll hear. Work is very busy. I didn't know that Andrea was expecting again. =
Be sure to send my congrats and best wishes. I hope Mark is feeling better.=
 He is too yound to be so stress. Sounds like your new house is beautiful. =
I bet you are looking forward to being all settled. Better get back to work=
. Great to hear from you and please send my best to everyone.

Chris

Hi Chris!  Hi Dan!
=20
Surprise, surprise, surprise!  I  just wanted to take a minute and express =
what a fan-tabulous video it was that  ran at the end of your mom's show th=
is year!  Your parts in it were  absolutely wonderful - came off beautifull=
y.  Was a teary ending to a L - O  - N - G show!  Of course, I put Mark on =
the spot immediately following the  show when we saw him and I said "OK Mar=
k, the camera is on you.....what great  things do you have to say about you=
r mom?"  He replied "Are you  serious?  You're not serious are you?"  To wh=
ich I said, "Yes, of  course I'm serious - you should have heard the great =
things Chris and Dan said  about their Mom!"  Well, he didn't let me down..=
...and then I had a few  more tears!  You guys did a great job with your pa=
rt of the video and I was  proud of you.
=20
Well, we are going through some major  changes here as I'm sure you know.  =
We took possession of our new "Red  Deer" home on June 1st and the first th=
ing we did was get Gunner in to install  hardwood flooring.  They just fini=
shed yesterday and it is awesome!   Originally there was hardwood in the fr=
ont entrance way, but we had that all  refinished to match the new stuff th=
at we had installed in the family room,  kitchen, and atrium.  I just love =
it!
=20
Today we meet the painter there and  choose colours and she will get starte=
d on Tuesday.  We'll have the whole  house painted pretty much and then we =
can start shuffling our "stuff" from here  to there.  It's quite overwhelmi=
ng moving everything from a barn, two  oversize double garages and this hou=
se into the city.  We had all the "farm  stuff" to sell and dispose of and =
that is pretty much all done now.  Dave's  tractor was his pool table fund =
and it just sold a week or so ago, so off to Red  Deer Billiards to purchas=
e the pool table.  He is having snooker rails put  on - I guess that's what=
 your folks have too, isn't it?  They tell me it's  harder to play and that=
 I should get practised up at home and then hit the bars,  challenge the un=
suspecting to a game of eight ball and then whoop their butts  (because I'd=
 be so incredibly good after practising on the snooker table).   Makes me l=
augh!  I'm pretty positive challenging anyone for a game would be  a joke o=
n my part, but hopefully I can get into "pool" mode and have fun with it  t=
oo.
=20
The yard at our new home is just  incredible compared to most Red Deer yard=
s.  The home is on a huge pie  shaped lot and has been landscaped beautiful=
ly, so we are quite pleased with  that.  And I LOVE the house.  It's really=
 very nice and I can hardly  wait for the whole move experience to be over =
and to be settled in there with  everything in it's place.  We overspent at=
 Sim's and that's going to be fun  receiving all that new furniture!
=20
Andrea, Michael and Braedon are doing  just fine.  They purchased a home in=
 Clearview Meadows and it's really very  nice!  Has a fenced yard with lots=
 of mature greenery and Braedon just  loves his new swing set and sand box.=
  Andrea & Michael are finding it  a real treat to be back in town and reli=
eves me that Andrea is so much closer to  the hospital.  She usually is wor=
king evening shifts and I always worried  about her travelling the highway =
so late at night, especially in the  winter.  They are expecting baby numbe=
r 2 and it would appear to be a girl  from the ultrasounds she's had so tha=
t is pretty exciting.  Miss Jordyn  Marie will be her name (they haven't de=
cided on a boy's name yet in the event  that Miss Jordyn Marie has a "Mr. W=
iggley" - but are pondering it).
=20
Mark, of course is a whole other  story.  That boy gives me a few new grey =
hairs on a regular basis.   He's no sooner apart from Nikki and "enter Alis=
on".  Alison is 18 years old  and very very quiet, so hard for us to get to=
 know her, but she seems quite nice  so that's a good thing.  (Not sitting =
around with a scowl on her face like  Nick usually did)  Mark and Alison ar=
e "in love" and are just ga-ga over  each other.  We are very nice to see h=
im so happy, although worry that it  all happened a bit soon.  But, what do=
 we know?  Mark has been having  trouble with his health and I'm somewhat c=
ertain it is stress related, however  he denies that.  He experiences such =
severe chest pains that he actually  passes out from the pain.  This has be=
en happening more frequently of late  and he had to leave the job he was on=
 in Fort St. John and return home to try to  get healthy before he moves to=
 Cold Lake on July 1st!  (That's the other  big change)  They've run EKG's =
(or ECG's) on him, taken blood, chest  X-Rays, etc. and results all came ba=
ck clear, so they are unable to determine  what is causing him his problems=
.  I guess he's dropped alot of weight and  is now underweight for his age =
and height.  The Dr. has now determined it  is a muscle related problem and=
 has him on muscle relaxants and apparently they  are helping somewhat, so =
hopefully it will be as easy as that.
=20
I'm sad to see him leaving for Cold Lake  again as it is so far away and we=
 won't get to see him much - but you guys know  all about that!  He, on the=
 other hand is quite excited to get away and get  a "new" start so to speak=
, once again.  Alison is moving up there with them  and they are pretty exc=
ited to set up their own home.  Right now Alison is  in Australia - a trip =
she has been planning and saving for for quite some time,  but she is missi=
ng Mark terribly and trying to come home early.
=20
We are going to the production "Chicago"  with your mom and dad next weeken=
d and I'm really looking forward to the  day.  Dave and I are planning a tr=
ip to Toronto Dan - just a quick 4 dayer  with another couple and I think w=
e've pretty much decided on August 16 - 19th,  but tickets haven't been pur=
chased yet.  We will go see the Lion King and I  want to drive out to Niaga=
ra Falls while we're there also.  Should be  fun.  Hard for us to focus on =
too much until we get this move  completed.  We have until August 1st befor=
e we actually give up possession  here on the farm and thank God for all th=
e time - we seem to be needing it and  it's just flying!
=20
Well boys, I better get off the computer  and get back to my packing.  Will=
 do some packing and then head into town  to run some errands before we hav=
e to meet the painter.  Take care you two  and once again - Great job with =
the video!
=20
xoxo
Jackie

Would you like to buy some $84 ENE Calls? How is you day going? Did you come to an agreement regarding your trip? Let me know what time you are going to be home tonight and I'll give you shout. 

Chris

The girl of my dreams.

 - wish.jpg << File: wish.jpg >> 

I checked out the whiskey on Saturday. Pretty cool club but the music has to go. And the whole no one under 35 policy really detracts from the talent. Mike is coming to town on Saturday and we are going to hit the town. Talk to you later. I have an excellent instilling jealous rage in the ex story for you but I'll save it to tell you in person.

Chris

apparently if you're so pissed you can't talk and the only place you can get into is the drink, girls are not going home with you. it sucked so i left pretty quick.  sorry i dragged you out.  i'm moving saturday so i'm not going out that night, but i think we might be going to the whiskey tonight.  after last weekend, i'm not expecting much though.  anyway, talk to you later
max 

How about TD bank. The gift that keeps on giving. Power still weak.

Have you made a packing list yet? I would have. Getting excited I bet. Better get back to work. Talk to you later...

Chris 

Hello Ladies and Gentleman!

Hopefully, everyone is well and did not suffer any damage.

I attached photos of the tunnel system.  Amazing!

No chance of me getting back on the cougar trail. I have devoted myself to scouting out dumb blondes under the age of 25. Ideally I will find some 22 year old Britney Spears look alike. Wish me well.

Chris

To sleep.....I bet the next time you have a couple drinks and no talent is in sight you'll be giving her a call.  Hottie from picture has a large E and blow problem - had to split - too much for this hayseed from RD.  Matt's stag is on Aug long.  I think you told me you weren't going to make it but you are coming to the wedding, right?  I'm just trying to plan how many dudes for golf.  

I'll be there for the wedding. No stag for me though.

I had to put the cougar to sleep. Too annoying for words. What happened to the hot from the picture?

not a whole lot new - except I went back to banging that broad from the office....I know, I'm weak.  I hadn't seen her for about a month, then I saw her in the office - she got tanned!  I buckled.  Still playing with Cougar?

I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing. My car is on the 4th floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine. I love the MTV movie awards. Shannon Elizabeth rules. Halle Berry naked in Swordfish. Can't wait. What's new with you? 

Holy shite! 
A little wet down there apparently...Did your car get flooded out in the parkade?  
Mike. 
PS. 
Did you see Nadia from American Pie on the MTV Video awards?  Wow.

Grant,

Who is your contact at Zargon? We have a discrepency between tagg and the confirm on the term of a deal and I need to talk to the marketing contact to figure out what is correct. We sold them a cal 01 crude put (according to the confirm) but the system has it continuing until feb 02.

Thanx Chris

What's up? I nearly drowned on the way home the other day. Beautiful weather we're having. Are you feeling better? I got a cold but I feel better today. The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night. Tonight is the MTV movie awards. I really need to get a life. I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene. I'll let you know if they are coming tommorow. Talk to you later.

Hi Chris,

We have done a cash allocation of $7011.69 that was sitting in your RRSP as
cash.  I will fax you the form to sign and you can fax it back to me.  There is
also $3570.89 cash sitting in your Locked-In RSP- we will allocate that near
the end of the month when a new fund from Mackenzie is released- Brad wants to
put some of this $ into it (Growth Trends).  Please e-mail a good time to fax
this to you so it is not laying around the office at your end.  Thanks.

Lee

John,

Rob and I are both in for golf on Sunday.

Chris

No problem.

Give me a day or two if you can. 
Rod 
Rod, 

I was thinking of buying my dad some cd's for father's day. Any 
suggestions? Be sure let Christina know I hope that she is feeling 
better. 

Chris 

You are in charge. I think some DVD's is a super plan. I was also thinking that a really nice hammock would be a great gift but I have no idea where to get one. I will talk to mom and see if she knows where we could get one. 

Chris

Rod,

I was thinking of buying my dad some cd's for father's day. Any suggestions? Be sure let Christina know I hope that she is feeling better.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 1600 Smith garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

I replied to this message earlier that I would like to move to the Enron Center garage but have not received a reply. Can I just go to the parking desk on level 3 and change my 1600 Smith card?

Very nice! I hate it when that happens. How is you week going? Mine has been pretty crazy but we're half way there. Talk to you later...

Chris

Rod,

When I am in the US can I buy/sell securities in my RRSP?

Chris

What's going on? Making some $? I having a pretty good month. What do you think of the stock market? I am practically all cash and Enron. Thinking of buying some TD and Royal Bank. Any great ideas?

Chris

Thanx!

I'm glad you had a good time. I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.

That guy has a huge pussy!

I think that you should make her something. Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache. I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).

Later skater...

Rod,

What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter. 

Chris

Did you send Amanda a card?

Hi

Sorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges. Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. Hope you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun. I shouldn't have gone to the bar. Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home. He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up. I imagine he picked up some lonely girl. I would love to do lunch one day next week. Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi. Take it easy.

Chris

Hi Chris, how's it going? I heard you stopped by yesterday but I wasn't
here...I was actually sick! Not still recovering from Saturday, I try to
keep my weekend binges on the lowdown here, not that they believe me but
I try.
Did you have fun Saturday? How was Crazy Horse? I actually had the same
cabbie as you guys who drove me home, he said he picked up 2 guys that
seemed to be angry with women and looking to go out on the town! That's
not how I figured it out...he said he picked you guys up at the same
house.
We'll have to make plans to go for lunch sometime soon. My work # is
294-3362 ext 224.
Talk to you soon,
Leslie

Hey,

What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...

Crystal,

Scott is off to Dallas for the weekend but I think I can swing checking out a game on Friday. How many people? I'll try to find some Enron tickets. Let me know...

Chris

Tych,

I'm looking for 4 tickets for Friday's Astros game. If you stumble upon any let me know. 

Thanx

Chris 

Stock market is exploding. Dow 11133 (up 260). Nasdaq 2150 (up 60). It has to be higher than where you bought now?

Are these change meant to keep me from losing 30% again this year?

Chris
Yes I did.
Please give me your correct address so I can mail you the copy of the cheque.

We will forward all mail to your new address instead of your parents from now

elequently written

Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the past two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario. I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get back to me with more specifics on my role within Netco and to see if I have the opportunity to get into trading. It came as quite a shock to me when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any commitment to join him on a retail venture or empowered him to speak on my behalf!

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding. I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my future earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organization.

Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any miscommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland

How was the Polo match? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale? A little disappointing if you ask me. I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms. A little uncomfortable. Bring on the Advil. Talk to you later...

Chris

You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas? Did she get her flowers for Mother's day? Father's day is coming up June 17. Maybe we should give Dad that Arnold Palmer flag for father's day. Later...

Any interest in playing golf Sunday with Ryan, my Dad and I ?

Dad,

Please don't forget to make tee times for Saturday and Sunday. I was thinking around noon Saturday and around 4pm on Sunday (Ryan can't make it untill then). 

Thanx,

Chris

I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know. If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back. Let me know...

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2923;

INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR? RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS

Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war could occur between India and
Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is not inevitable; diplomacy could
still pull the two parties back.

*  Such a war--if it does occur--need not prompt doomsday predictions or
excessive global concern so long as both countries see short-term political
advantages accruing from a tightly contained conflict.

*  It would have a complicating but manageable impact on the American-led
counterterrorism effort in south and central Asia.

*  A very limited-duration conflict could even lead to intensive multilateral
efforts to solve the Kashmir dispute, the central dispute between India and
Pakistan.

I have cooking class #2 tonight (soups and stocks). Should be a good time. Starting to get a little busier at work. Hopefully we will be up and trading sometime next week. I am coming to Red Deer this weekend. If you aren't busy we should do something on Saturday night. Have a great week and I will talk to you soon.

Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S. 
Unit remains solvent: Part of package to sell trading business, Milnthorp says
Claudia Cattaneo, Calgary Bureau Chief 
Financial Post; with files from Bloomberg News 
CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading operations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executive of the Canadian unit said yesterday.
Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be "critical" to a deal to sell Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company.
The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.
If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a white knight of its own, he said.
"We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time."
Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.
In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.
Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.
Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a "significant but undetermined" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.
Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation "has nothing to do with Enron Canada."
The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.
Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called "Netco," short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.
Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.
"To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process," he said.
Enron Canada's remaining employees are "trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid," he said.
The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.
Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.

Sandi, 

The exisiting contracts on Lone Star are sufficient to cover deliveries to 
the plant (95,000 Mmbtu maximum daily quantity).  In the event that we have 
to transport excess gas to alternate locations, we will be using an ENA 
transport agreement and charging the expense back to Tenaska IV.

D

Daren,
Will there ever be a need to utilize transport to get supply to the plant 
other than through the 2 Lone Star agreements? If so, would we be using 
Tenaska transport agreements or ENA? 

Megan, 

For 8/1/00, allocate the receipt of gas a Cotton Valley to the exchange 
deal.  Since we did not deliver anything to them on that day, the settlement 
will occur at GD-.10.  Originally, we were working on a spot deal for this 
day.  Then, after the fact, we agreed to let the deal fall out under the 
exchagne deal.  I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.

For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.  Due to 
operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the 
deliveries on Monday.  I apologize for not getting this info to you earlier.

D

   

Daren:
I am having trouble with 8/00.  The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at 
Fuels Cotton.  We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange 
deal 157288.  You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had 
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.  Since there was a 
spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.  Duke says that 
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at 
GD - 0.10.  The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.  Please let 
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.  
The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/00.  Duke is telling 
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are 
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.  This 
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline 
shows all of the gas on the 7th.  This is a daily swing meter which 
electronically feeds into settlements.  We don't normally change these 
meters.  If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The 
emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.

Megan
mkhenderson@duke-energy.com on 10/10/2000 02:25:30 PM
Read information below and see if this helps one of the unresolved problems
for August.

 Megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for August 1?  I do not
know why August 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the Fuel Cotton Valley gas.  This is
priced at HSC daily - .10 per paragraph 3 of the contract.  If a different
price was worked out with Darren, I do not have record of it.  Darren is
out until next week.

Please disregard the memo below and the following will apply for 8/4/00:

Deliveries to Eastrans will be 7,800 MMBtu/dy
Redeliveries into HPL from Fuels Cotton Valley

For 8/5, 8/6, & 8/7 (Saturday, Sunday & Monday) deliveries to Eastrans will
be 7,800 MMBtu/dy (23,400 MMBtu for 3 days).  The deliveries of this gas
will occur in a batch on Monday, 8/7.
Redeliveries into HPL from Fuels Cotton Valley
Marta K Henderson
08/03/2000 08:58 AM

Please increase deliveries to Eastrans to 30,000 MMBtu/dy effective 8/4/00

The redeliveries will be:

7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
22,200 to PG&E

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

D

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi 

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Thanks,

With regards ti the Koch Midstream, you could talk to Daren Farmer about it. 
Also, Carlos Rodriguez could help.

The price should be 3.56.  There had been alot of price and volume 
discussions for this gas day and 8/1/00.  I checked the notes and found that 
we actually settled at 3.56 instead of 3.58.

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers.

Suzanne, 

I was out last week, so I am just now getting back with you.  We primarliy 
served the Texas Desk commercial team, with about 10% of time spent on 
Producer Services.  The non routine activity should be allocated to the Texas 
Desk.

Thanks for your spreadsheet.  One thing I still need from you is what 
commercial teams your group was supporting overall ?  In addition, I noticed 
you allocated 15 hours to the activity ES002 - Non Routine Trade Monitoring & 
Reporting.  What commercial team(s) was this 15 hours spent supporting?

Thanks!

Megan, 

I have made these adjustments.  HOwever, I would like for you to double check 
August.  We knew that Pan Energy would be over delivering at Cotten Valley 
for 8/9/00 through the end of the month.  So I changed the pricing on the 
deal to the GD-.10 settlement price for that time period.

D

   

Here are the cashout entries for 7/00 and 8/00.

July 2000
Deal 157278 ($759.75) excess charge
  $33,992.14 cashout
  $33,232.39 Total
(There is no purchase cashout for 7/00.)

Aug 2000
Deal 157278 $90.18  cashout
  $6,745.50 excess charge
  $6,835.68 Total

Deal 157288 $9,575.45 cashout

Thanks,
Megan

I fixed it.

   

I am having trouble pulling in the demand charge for 6/00 on deal 157278 for 
$1,129.09.  The only thing that is different from May is that the demand 
volume is 0.  I think it needs to be a 1 for the charge to come through.  
Please take a look.

Thanks,
Megan

Done.  I could not seperate the excess charge and cashout charges under the 
demand expense.  They are combined on the ticket.

D

   

Here are the cashout amounts for 5/00 and 6/00 for Duke Energy Field 
Services.  We also need to enter a demand fee to account for the excess of 
103% charge on the sale side.  I have those amounts below.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

May 2000
Deal 157278 $2,486.00 excess charge
  $2.38  cashout

Deal 157288 $71.85  cashout

June 2000
Deal 157278 $920.21  excess charge
  $208.88  cashout

(There is no purchase cashout for 6/00)

Thanks,
Megan

I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any 
problems with Ocean Energy.  Sorry.

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.

These are not spot deals.  PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange.  
However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley.  According to the 
contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.  So, in 
order to correctly estimate our economics, I changed the price on the 
delivery to reflect how the deal will settle.  This occurred in August and 
September.  Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets.

Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in 
place.  (PanEnergy overdelivered about 7,800 per day, which we buy at Gas 
Daily -.10)

D

   

Daren:
I am taking over the Duke account from Katherine and am having trouble with 
8/00 production.  It looks like we have some spot deals included in the 
exchange deal 157288.  I think days 9 - 31, which are priced at GD - 0.10, 
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot.   Let me know if you 
agree.  Also, can you confirm for me that days 8/5 and 8/6 are suppose to be 
exchange?  The sale volume for those two days was zero, so there was no 
exchange.  We have not received any statements from Duke yet, so there is 
nothing to verify our volumes.

You may also want to look at Sept. 2000 for deal 157288.  It looks like spot 
deals are being included in the exchange deal.  Those will need to be moved 
to a new ticket if they are spot.

Thanks,
Megan

I rolled this deal for day one in October only.  

Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it 
roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.

Attached is the preliminary agency agreement related to the Cleburne Plant.  
This is strictly confidential, so please do not pass this info on to others.  
I will let you know when we have finalized the contract and send you a copy.

Attached is the red lined draft of the Gas management Agreement with the 
changes we discussed. Please review and give me your comments. If you can 
supply any of the needed Notice info in Section 8 please let me know---

Melissa, 

It would help us considerably if Vance would include the prices for new deals 
in the monthly nom.  In order to manage our postion and schedule the gas, we 
need to put the deals into Sitara.  We will enter spot deals with the info 
Vance gives us.  When the deals are ticketed, the risk group will adjust 
Sitara with the finalized terms.  

Thanks for your help.

D

   

Daren, 

Per our phone conversation, please find the following information:

Camden Resources Inc., Driscoll Ranch #1, meter 9858, price:  HSC less $0.10
North Central Oil Corporation, McMurrey-Talbert #2, meter 5228, price:  HSC 
less $0.14
KCS, Dickenson, meter 9797 - Susan Smith will be preparing a formal ticket 
for the Buy and the Sell for the month of October.  We will be watching the 
gas specs on this package, and if all goes well, we will book the rest of the 
term at the end of October.

On a go forward basis, for gas that we provide in the monthly nomination that 
we know is not ticketed, can Vance just include the price in the comments 
field on each package to help you estimate for bid-week?  Let us know if this 
information will be helpful in the future.

Thank you, 
Melissa

I have entered the following deals into Sitara for October:

Camden Resources Inc. @ mtr 9858, 3000/day #420113  (This counterparty is not 
currently in the system)
North Central Oil Corporation @ mtr 5228, 3000/day #420114

These deals have not been finalized as of yet.  But, I have entered them to 
assist us with managing our postion and scheduling the pipe.  Let me know if 
you have any quesitons.

D

Mark, 

It looks like we will probably take over the Cornhusker deal in October.  So, 
I need you to get the following information for Lone Star, Williams, and 
Apache:

Contact Name
Phone #
Fax #
Mailing address

We will be sending notices to these parties indicating our agency agreement 
with the plant (Tenaska IV Texas Partners Ltd.)

Additionally, we will need this information from the plant manager.

Please gather this information as soon as you can from Nancy Stivers.

Thanks.

D

Please adjust the deals in Sitara to reflect this change.

Mary Poorman@ENRON

Per gas control, Shell has requested that we lower meter 1581 by 5M and 
increase 1095 by 5M; net effect is zero.  Please let me know if the deal 
needs to be adjusted to reflect the change.

Mary

I have rolled or input the following deals for October.

Crosstex 138553  2
Duke  418429  139
Hesco  394798  500
Swift  418431  322
Tri-Union 418432  700
Vintage  403367  300
Whiteoak 418434  96
Whiting  418436  100

So, I am showing that the only deals we have outstanding for Oct are:

Camden/9858  3000
Heatherlock/6879 544  (previous deal#133010)
North Central/5228 3000

Julie - Please check these deals for the correct contract/terms.  Also, 
please look into Heatherlock.  Vance is noming gas for this deal.  However, 
the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag. When I tried to roll another 
month, I got a message that another contract was needed.

Thanks.

D

Done.

I have entered a one month deal in Sitara - deal # 416019 for referenced sale

This delivery is subject to an external expense transport fee to Entex - see 
old deal Sitara 93471 for details

Fee to Entex is 5 cents

PLEASE :  someone enter this transport info into deal # 416019 as I don't 
know how/what to do ....

FYI
FYI - did a baseload deal with Union Carbide at Seadrift HPL meter # 1332 for 
Oct00 that will require some coordination with Terry Calvert of Union 
Carbide, who can be reached at 713-973-5665.  I want to pass on details in 
case I'm out when he calls - I'm going to pass on y'all's phone #'s to Terry

Here's the deal:

10,000/d @ IFHSC - $0.04
10,000/d @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

PLUS

0 to 10,000/d swing to be nominated day before @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

So Terry knows he's supposed to call us by 9.30am if he wants gas to take any 
of the last tier.

All the above is in Sitara 415267

Thanks

Lee

KH, 

HSC-.0825 is the correct price, based on the final agreement.  I have 
corrected the deal in Sitara.

Deal #231757
Purchase

The deal in sitara indicates that the price for East Texas Gas Systems is  
HSC, Index -$.085.
Per the contract, the redelivery  at ETGS Carthage Hub Tailgate should be 
priced at  HSC Index -$.0825.  
Are these the same points and is the price correct?

Thanks
katherine 

KH, 

We created deal 229758 a while back to correct this.  You will need to get 
Vol Mgmt to reallocate volumes from #157288 to this deal to close it out.

Deal #157288

It appears that the price on PGEV should be Index less $.06 not Index less

The Cleburne Plant will be down for an outage during the following time 
period:

9/24  1/2 day
9/25-10/4 entire day

So, we will have about 45,000/day to sell.  The supply costs are $2.777 for 
25,000 & $2.742 for 20,000.

D

I think Mark got everything in last night.  You may have to have Vol Mgmt 
send things through.  Look into it and let me know how it looks.  I will 
probably be out of the office on Monday, returning on Tuesday.

Please read the message below.  What do you think about increasing the fee?

Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the 
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

Well, I got selected.  The judge estimated that we would probably be there 
through Friday.  I will be in the office each morning until 9:15 and may 
return some evenings.  If you need anything, you can leave me a voice mail or 
call Liz and Stacey.

D

FYI.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, 9/19/00, for jury duty.

Please contact Stacey Neuweiler (3952) or Liz Bellamy (6029) if you need 
anything.

D

Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me 
know where we stand.

Thanks.

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV
 July 399763
 Aug 399773

Sell to Tenaska Marketing
 July 399791
 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP
 Aug 399814

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.

Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend 
from Texas.  I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members

Mark).

Let me know if you have any questions.

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL

Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC

There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.

2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.

Let me know how you want to handle it.

Robert, 

There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for 
HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?  
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract 
and HPL contract?

that's fine

You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but 
you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not 
be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them 
later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with 
me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 
8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather 
meeting.

Michael Olsen@ENRON
12/07/2000 02:29 PM
Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike

under ENA.  So, we don't need to sign the contracts you sent earlier.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.  Nothing should 
be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks 
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the 
16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis 
(Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter 
balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal. 

Daren J Farmer
08/23/2000 12:59 PM
Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

D

	
	

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

I rolled deal 331917.

Aimee Lannou   09/05/2000 11:04 AM

Daren - can you get a deal set up for meter 1459 for 8/00?  The last deal 
number associated with this meter is 331917 for July 00. Counterparty - GSF

Daren,

I believe the best way to enter the fee into Sitara would be as a Demand fee 
in your example #1. 
If we do the fee this way, we will not  double up the volumes.

I have attached my spreadsheet for support:
THE MOST CURRENT WORKSHEET IS TAB #2 MARKED FINAL

Column G is the Over-Delivery quantity total is 17,278 mmbtus
Column S is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due HPLC  
$1,008.87 
Column T is the Daily dollar amount for the over-delivery quantity due the 
customer $519.73.

Thanks-

You probably haven't had time to look at the Duke Energy price.  When you get 
a chance could you please let me know what the correct price is for May 2000 
production.

	
	

Elizabeth,
Sorry, I can't remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what.  
Were you looking into this issue  for me or was it passed to someone else.
Please see the email below.  I believe the system is pulling in the wrong 
price for WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I.. for 5/00 production.  The deal # is 250237.
 I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2.95.  
The price of $2.95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2.96 which is what Duke 
is 
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3.95.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

	
	

Elizabeth,
I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or 
Oneil.  
It's for Duke Energy, 5/00 production, deal # 250237.  Duke believes our 
price is too high.  The system downloaded a price of  $3.95 
The price should be WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. , which is $2.95 for that month.  ( 
WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. + 1 ) Duke believes we should have paid them $2.96.
I think the system pulled in the wrong price.  Could you please let me know 
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else?

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

We're working on it.  We have had alot of issues with the colder weather.  I 
will let you know as soon as we get Oct in.  I adjusted #514353, so hopefully 
the demand will come through better.

D

   

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created 
and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.

Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system 
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would 
create).

Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no 
meters, so they are not set up.  I will try to find the meter numbers for 
these locations.  I don't think we will be using them much.  So, it may be a 
few days before I get the info together.

The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I 
need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  Please add the 01.

We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is 
this the same point???  This is the same point.

Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.

I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates:

Mar 11-31    15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045

April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.  An

until the   12th.

I thought it might be easier to reply by email of the

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

D

	
	

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Please see the attached Tufco file for July.  The 2,500 under the Wagner 
Brown contract on the 24th has been zeroed out (no flow at LS Katy for that 
day).  This resulted in a change between contracts/deals on the 31st also.  
Let me know if you have any questions.

D

These deals should be converted to ENA-IM Texas.  Is there a way that you can 
change all of these deals systematically?

D

   
	
	

Should these not be converted to ENA - IM Texas ???  Some time ago - we were 
told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end.  This desk is not 
included in any Texas desk portfolios.

The ECT desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep 
rolling - and 
someone created some new ones?   If the desk is active - should we change it 
to ENA - IM Waha - 
as ECT is no more ???

You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.  Ask them about their 
Lone Star transport allocation.  They had to transport the gas on Lone Star 
to sell to us.  So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their 
transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match 
the sale volume.  Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the 
transport allocation.

D

Rebecca Griffin@ENRON

I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from 
8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they 
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where 
we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided 
meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am 
unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.  

For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased 
1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows 
the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase 
piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered 
deal?

August 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas  deals# 104975, 104256, 104738
Lone Star Gas Co. deal# 101985
Purchase

Daren- Was 10/99 the only month we transported this Carthage gas on Tejas?
Mary Poorman@ENRON
08/17/2000 02:55 PM
I phoned Doug Trachta at Tejas regarding this issue.  I appears that 
nominations were made under ENA's agreement 6520 on Tejas Pipeline Company 
from Carthage to Indian Hills.  However, both of these points are actually on 
the Tejas Gas Operating.  ENA doesn't have an agreement to ship on Operating, 
but HPL does.   I think we need to set up an accounting arrangement to 
accomodate this deal, it appears as though ENA would be "piggy-backing" on 
HPL's agreement as they actually own the gas.  It appears as though we need 
to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating, at the very least.  How have 
other months been handled with respect to this transport?

Please let me know if I may be of any further assistance in resolving this 
deal.

This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL.  
However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, 
who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015.

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport

Our game is at 7:00 tomorrow night, can everyone make it?

Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.

 We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take 
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each 
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we 
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within 
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual 
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.

D

   

Robert,
There is a large variance between noms and flow at this meter.  Is everyone 
in the loop on this.  Pat

Mike, 

You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but 
you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not 
be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them 
later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Is this single or double elimination?

John, 

I need information on the following questions related to Cornhusker:

1)  I understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of 
the supply, transport, and sales contracts.  Who will be handling the 
financiol accounting  and reporting for these deals?

2)  Is someone in Legal currently assigning the contracts to ENA?

3)  What is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant?

4)  Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the 
pipeline for July and August activity.  Is this true?  I thought we weren't 
taking responsibility for this until September business.  We are not prepared 
to pay the suppliers for July.

5)  Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book?

Thanks.

For faster viewing, I would suggest you go to the first page of pictures and
click the "Small Slideshow" link. This will bring down all the photos at
once, and will cycle through all of them four times in a slideshow. Please
note that it might take some time to download all the pictures, depending
upon the speed of your connection to the Internet.

After the slideshow starts, all of the regular-sized pictures on the other
pages will temporarily be on your PC, which should make clicking through
each page a little faster.

If you run into problems viewing any of the pages/pictures, please drop me a
note.

Tonya/Daren: You will probably be more interested in the pictures on pages 5
and 6, which is also the fifth and sixth rows of the index page.

Thanks,

-Ram.

An adjustment is required on the Tufco contract for July 2000.  The volume 
for the 23rd was overstated by 5,000.  This resulted in revisions on the 23rd 
and 28th.  Please see the attached Tufco.  If you have any questions, give me 
a call @ 36905.

Is it very dark in color?  And how big around is it?

B, 

I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:

1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to 
Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to 
interview her.  Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times, 
even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.  Pat Clynes 
fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately 
called Toni to get it straightened out.  Toni called me at home, which is 
good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to 
discuss information with me.

2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.  This has 
improved over the last week.  She has called me a couple of times awaiting my 
decision on salary concerns.  So, I think that she is trying to stay on top 
of this now.

Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.

The term contract with Four Square attached to deal #138049 has been 
terminated.  Therefore, we need to take that deal to zero for August 2000 
forward.  Additionally, we entered into a base load (August only) deal to 
purchase the gas from Four Star at mtr 6599 (#348446).  The 1,500/day should 
be schueduled on this deal.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.

Pat, 

This is the Texaco Fee CP, it flowed a total of 1,517 from Dec 99 to Apr 2 
2000.  There is a Strangers Agmt. set up to take allocations, however, this 
must be a wellhead related pt. that has declined.  How do I go about finding 
out who this belongs to?  I thought about ringing Texaco, but, wanted to 
check before I made any calls.

Stephanie, you are correct.  There's no deal set up for this meter from 12/99 
thru 4/2000.

Mary, please take a look at the meter for the months in question and let 
Stephanie or myself know whose gas this belongs to.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

	
	

Anita, 
If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the 
correct person.

For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for 
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume 
management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the 
volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know.  

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

I'll be there.  I mean it this time.  Really.

Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request.  There 
has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.  If you are 
planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It 
is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   

We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL 
Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to 
appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you 
by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we 
acquired from HR.  Please print this memo for any employees who do not have 
access to email.

Thank you so much for your help.

Dave, 

This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.  We did not get this info., 
so Sitara was not adjusted.

D

Lee,

On Saturday, April 1st, Lubrizol will cut over natural gas supply from Enron
to Coral at Lubrizol's Bayport plant.

In order to accomplish cut over activities, we will need a technical
representative(s) from Enron at Lubrizol's Bayport plant to participate in
the activities and to insure Enron's interests and assets are protected.

Would you please make arrangements to have an Enron technical
representative(s) report at 12:00 noon, April 1st, to the Main Guard House
at Lubrizol's Bayport plant and ask for Lubrizol's David Massigill.  David
is coordinating all the cut over operations.

If you have any questions about this, please contact me (at the numbers
indicated below) or David Massigill at (281) 479-2851, ext 2511.

Thanks and best regards.

Team,

We are still waiting on the Agreements to be returned to us for the Camden 
Driscoll Ranch #3 Well.  We should receive them by Monday, December 4, 2000.  
I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well 
would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine 
plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just 
an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please 
forward this email to anyone that I might have left out.

Thank you!

We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.  
So, we shouldn't pay for this gas.

PanEnergy purchase: Deal #231758.
 
Gas in the amount of 271 mmbtus for April 1st was purchased from PanEnergy on 
deal # 231758 . 
However, scheduling has indicated that they have no sale for that gas on day 
one and as a result, it is not pathed in the system.
 
Could you please review this item and see if it should or shouldn't be a sale 
so that Scheduling can either path April 1st or I can dispute the volume 
being billed to us by Pan Energy. 

This is part of Pan Energy's exchange deal.

 As I  told Thu before (see below), I did not see any volumes for that deal 
in 4/00. I think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in 
March and probably should be allocated to that month. I dont show a deal to 
purchase or sell that gas in April. If you have any more questions please let 
me know, thanks.

Katherine,

 This is a brokered deal (Buy Deal 231758 and Sell Deal 93472).  This first 
day was not pathed, that's why you are missing volume of 271.  Per Carlos 
(see below) the deal was not for day one.

Thu
Carlos,

 I don't think I can allocate April's volume to March production.  Could you 
please extend the deal to April 1 so that I can allocate it.  Thanks

Mary, 

Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I 
am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs 
acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in 
July, so we should not be receiving anything.

Daren,

Mary Gregg from LCRA said that Sitara #283939 should have been for 
$4.50/MMBtu.  Currently in Deal Manager-Sitara, it is at $2.50 and that is 
the price that I billed them at.  Please verify the price and let me know 
what you find out.

If you have any question, please, call me.

The Methanol Plant is still on target to begin making spec methanol on 
Friday, July 28.   The plant may start taking some natural gas late Tuesday, 
July 25.  

Because of dredging at the Oxy dock, no barges can be loaded July 31 to 
August 3.

Megan, 

I have created deal 514353 to capture the $.04 agency fee for the Tenaska 
deal.  This deal will have zero volume and zero commodity price with a demand 
charge of $.04 on 45,000/day.  Since there is no volume, Mark McCoy will be 
scheduling this deal as a zero nom.  Hopefully, this will allow the demand 
charge to flow through the system.  Let me know if you don't see this 
happening.  For Sep and Oct, you will need to get someone in Volume 
Management to create an accounting arrangement for this deal (pathed to the 
imbalance pool).  When actuals come in, you can give me the volumes and I 
will change the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off of the sale 
ticket (#384258).

D

In order to account for the same day change at Katy, please schedule the 
following deals for 7/24/00 only:

At Exxon Katy (Mtr 4132):

 Allocate -0- to deal 284599
 Allocated 4,500 to deal 339604

At Lone Star Katy (Mtr 67): 
 Allocate 5,000 to deal 341801(new deal)
 Allocate 5,500 to deal 341808 (new deal)

Please remember that EOL deals are firm.  This means that we can't change the 
location, volume, or price on these deals.  If questions arise around an EOL 
deal, please make sure that your audience (traders, myself, etc.) knows that 
your are discussing an EOL trade.

Let me know if you have any questions.

During the month of June there is flow at meter 6347, but there is no deal.  
There is a deal in May (deal 290472), "Could you extend that deal for the 
month of June?"

Esther, 

Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've 
invited him on.

  Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from 
Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.

The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 
pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.

I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 
3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.  I will probably have 
to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.

If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.

can have Vol. Management create an accounting arrangement for it.  If you are 
not the person that I need to contact, could you let me know who I need to 
talk to.

Hillary, 

Can we extend deal 77352 for the rest of the year?  I tried to do this, but I 
got the message to add a contract.  This deal is set up in case GSF needs 
compressor fuel and should roll each month.  However, there is no line for 
July.

October deal by mistake.  The marketer immediately called the desk and we 
agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a 
second deal in EOL.  Coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it 
was unwound.  But, since EOL deals are automatically processed and are firm 
transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to 
zero volume and price.  Logistics will be brokering the transactions in 
MOPS.  Please be sure that Coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.  
Again, they will not have a record of the deals.

The Sitara deals are: 287946 and 288653.

Let me know if you have any questions.

 FYI...ONLY !

 Gary agreed to let the deficiency volumes hit the buyback that is set 
presently.

	
	

  Effective March 11th  Valero has not pulled any gas on a 35.0/day 
nomination.
 
  Do you want to arrange a buyback for this activity. There is a buyback 
ticket { # 148381} available
  to handle any underage.
 
  I am being told this interconnect will be down 2-weeks; effective March

handle it?

I have rolled # 143559 through July 2000 to cover the purchase from 
Republic.  We sell this gas to Duke Energy Field Services (#143558 for Jan - 
Apr,  CES-Duke Energy Field Services, Inc ).  The counterparty on this deal 
has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke 
Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC.

Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke 
counterparty to this deal.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Republic Royalty is one of my CES deals.  They sent me an invoice for May

Gary, 

Does the workhseet mentioned below assist you with the monthly operations 
related to the industrial customers?

D
 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.
 
      I am on vacation during the week of July 5th thru July 10th.

   

Robert,
How do we look on the industrial deadlines?  Please let me know.   Thanks,  
Pat

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

Wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might 
involve your desks via EOL in the near future. We already have one in the 
East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments 
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is 
happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and 
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will 
include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or 
exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the 
counterparty desires.
I hope this helps...THANKS!

	
	

Can you all meet this afternoon or tomorrow to discuss this. 
Call me 3-1488.

	
	

Got any ideas on how this transaction should look.  This looks like a monthly 
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once 
the counterparty has made their decision  (I would imagine logistics will be 
the one communicating with the counterparty).  We probably need EOL to 
indicate whether it is a 3, 5, 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this 
as comments.

Linda/Karen -what are your thoughts on how separate GTC would work on this.

If we could all do a little homework.  I will get something scheduled for 
next week to discuss further.

SRM (x33548)
We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will refer 
to as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting a 
GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I 
will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type 
description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the 
transaction works:

Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index

Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take 
delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three 
forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated 
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If 
Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

I understand that this type of transaction is currently done 
over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of 
Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.

Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then 
my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to 
the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will 
require three different Product Types?

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Daren,

I left you a message regarding this matter 2 days ago.  Was wondering if you 
had time to look into this.

Conoco is saying that we are missing one day of sale to them:  5/5  10,000 
mmbtu at 2.95, deal #256686.

I am not seeing this in Sitara.  Could you please confirm?  

Customer has already called twice asking us to invoice them for this.

Thanks for your help on this.

Joanie

Sitara #139066 has a max of 9500 in the flex nom.  Is this correct?  Should 
the additional 1500 be on a swing ticket or included on the index ticket?

very small volume.  Could you please create a deal for this?

Thanks.

This is to confirm that we need to take our delivery to HPL meter # 1428 to 
zero !!

Beaumont Methanol started a controlled shut-down last night (they will be 
down in Dec00 due to high gas prices) .... and it became an "out-of-control" 
shut in and they had to shut down last night, and are now taking no gas from 
the DuPont header.

I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.  Late Friday 
night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of 
HPL.  The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will 
be 11,300/d.  Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at 
Gas Daily.  I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday 
forward.  Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market 
impact.  We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume 
changed and adjust if necessary.

D

Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 
forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes 
to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.  
You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  

The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time 
involved in updating the deal.

In 1925 Houston Pipe Line Company was formed to fuel a growing Houston 
economy.  Over the past 75 years, we have expanded our physical network 
across the Texas Gulf Coast, and we now offer a wide range of financial, 
commodity and risk management services.    HPL is the largest single supplier 
of gas to Entex and is one of the most flexible intrastate pipeline systems 
in the country due to our 118 Bcf Bammel Storage field.

To celebrate our 75th birthday, I am pleased to invite HPL employees and 
their spouse or guest to a company-sponsored event on Saturday the 9th of 
September at Moody Gardens in Galveston, Texas.  The attached invitation 
provides the details.  Additional information will be sent to you over the

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of 
day Friday, June 2.

Please note the following updates:
For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the 
survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please 
provide statistics accordingly
If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email 
Jennifer Reside
If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, 
please call or email Jennifer Reside

If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the 
surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will 
eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like 
us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next 
month, please let Jennifer know.

Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation 
this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted 
time.

 

I changed the dates to 1999.

Daren:

Thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter, I appreciate it.  

There is a slight problem however, I couldn't find the deals for July and 
November 1999 in Path Manager.  I looked in Sitara and I see where you put 
the deal 269123 in for May 1999, but it is also in for July and November of 
2000.  Did you mean to put the deal in for July and November of 1999 and 
inadvertently put it in for July and November 2000?  If so would you put it 
in for July and November 1999 and send me an e-mail when you are done.  
Thanks,  

Fred

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

The message below was sent Friday afternoon and came back with an incorrect 
address. Merry gave me the corrected e-mail address shown above.

New developments. Merry and the baby went home this afternoon and he has now 
been named. He is Brandon Aaron Byington

Hi there, Darren & Tonya,

Merry and Doc had their new baby at 9:26 AM yesterday. No name yet. They are 
still trying to settle on one, so in the mean time, I'm just calling him "New 
Child" Byington.

He weighed 7 lbs 2 oz and was 19 1/4" long. Merry, Doc, and "New Child" are 
doing fine. Doc was in there during the whole delivery (C section) so he says 
he was a bit shakey there a time or two.

Here are some digital camera pics I took when "N. C." was less thasn an hour 
old.

Daren - I need to get with you to find out when things (Industrials)  need to 
get in to the system for December.  Since this is a weird month, I thought 
things might have to be in sooner.  Let me know.

Aimee

BH, 

Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than 
planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to 
trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing 
reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to 
hire an additional person, this will change.  Let me know if you have any 
questions on my list of accomplishments.

Kim, Mary, 
Please forward this on to your people. 

I hope you are ready to BOWL!!!!  Tomorrow we will meet in the lobby at 2:45 
and begin to load our buses and depart for the bowling alley.  Their will be 
two buses departing at 2:45 and at 3:00 just to make sure we get any 
stragglers.  

As soon as we arrive you will join your team members (your teams have already 
been chosen and there is no swapping, negotiating or shuffling allowed).  You 
will be notified tomorrow as we depart who is on your team and their will be 
signs at the bowling alley marking the lanes for each team. 
 
Our plan is to bowl three games or until time allows.  At 5:30 we will gather 
for prizes and awards and depart at 6:00. 

Please see your admin today for your bowling shirt.  We highly encourage you 
to wear it tomorrow, either with jeans or khakis, whichever you prefer.  If 
you don't wear your shirt, you run the risk of being ridiculed by your 
co-workers, sticking out like a sore thumb when you bowl, or being left out 
of any future reindeer games (just teasing).

If you have any questions please see your admin. 

Thank you!
Yvette

Steve, 

I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 
2000.  Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.  But since 
our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where 
HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.  ENA then transports the 
gas to a delivery point.  If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an 
additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery 
point.  This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and 
completing the scheduling in reasonable time.  Plus, it just doesn't make 
sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as 
HPLC.  Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.

Thanks for your help.

Daren
Daren J Farmer
04/04/2000 04:47 PM
Steve, 

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Thanks.

Daren

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport, 
especially Oasis, and I disagree that it should be HPL cause most of the 
things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be.
Daren J Farmer
03/22/2000 12:05 PM
Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.

Daren

The Oasis contract #s are:  028 27099 201

PG&E parking and lending contracts awaiting approval: PLE00004

This is a estimate for UA4, fuel, loss, and various other operational 
usages.  This deal should be handled like the other operational tickets in 
the system.

Daren - Is there a reason there is a nom of 20.000/day at meter 385?  This is 
a non-allocatable meter.

AL

Bob, 

Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not 
El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a 
higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom 
there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as 
possible to what we have in the system now.

D

   

Daren,

Charlotte Hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5,733 with El 
Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their 
nomination as follows:

C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.  
Thanks.

Bob

You need to get with the East desk on this.  Were they allocated this volume 
on Tetco?  If so, you can adjust the deal and have the East desk approve it.  
If they were not allocated this flow, the volume should go on the OBA.

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

still beleives that we owe them for this gas.

Thanks, Stephanie (3-6004) 

	Anita Luong
	03/03/2000 02:11 PM
	
Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.  

Thanks
	
	

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Let's keep the current noms in the system for now.  After a few days have 
flowed, we will look at all the wellhead volumes and adjust if needed.

D

   

Daren,

We have received revised nominations from Prize Energy Resources, L.P. for 
June, 2000.  The revisions are as follows:

Meter #  Original Volume  Revised Volume

5579  2,209   2,536
6534  1,906   1,123
6614  2,215   2,128

Do you want me to enter the revised volumes?  Please advise.  Thanks.

This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES 
information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not 
mean that there isn't one.

Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas 
at the Gulf Plains plant as it relates to the CES acquisition?

The position reports to me and is budgeted.

June volumes on Tejas are attached.

I will be out 6/9 on a customer trip (San Antonio with Aquila).

I will be on vacation in July from 1st-7th.

D

CR and AL, 

We bought 8000 from Richardson (#245410) at Teco - Lone Star Katy and sold it 
to Tufco at that point on 5/12/00.  At 3am Tufco cut us on the sale, 
resulting in only 6,000 flowing to Tufco for the day.  We need to find out 
what PGE did with the remaining 2,000 we bought from Richardson.  Did they 
deliverit to us at HPL?  Or did they cut Richardson?  Or, are they showing 
that we have gas stranded at that point?  Please look into this and let me 
know.

D

AC, 

You may need to fax a copy of the invitation for the July trip to Tim.  When 
I talked to him today, he hadn't seen anything.  (My fault, I turned the 
names in late.)  The real invitaion should be delivered to him soon.

   Please feel free to fax or email to your customers as you see necessary,

After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few 
discrepancies with the Tufco volumes.  
 
   HPL   PG&E

5/8   137.500   139.583

5/11   103.750   100.833

5/19   108.333   8.333

Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19 
discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that 
it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what 
flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and 
corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this 
decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL 
4.649.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

HPL is ok.

Julie, 

What info do you have on the Praxair deal (#70171)?  Should this be on ENA or 
HPLC?

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I 
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda 
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial 
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it 
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to 
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl, 

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas 
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc

ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most 
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be 
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me 
know if you need something like that.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.

Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

ENA Gas Assets Group Outing

You have between now and June 6th to practice and get ready.  It's time to 
get in touch with you inner bowler.  That's right, we are going bowling!!!!  
Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.

 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

No.

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete 
required daily tasks such as P&L?

No.

You've got to love idiotic calls, don't you?  An onside kick after you've won 
the game?  What was Barnett  thinking?  

I don't think I'll ever watch another Aggie football game...ohh, the misery.  
I can't handle the emotional rollar coastar.

Anyway, How was Thanksgiving?  Did you make your trip out to pick up the 15 
ft christmas tree?  Or was it bigger this year?  We made the journey to 
Tuscaloosa.  The trip wasn't too bad.  That TV/VCR is a lifesaver.  I ate way 
too much, but it sure was good.  

Hope everthing's going good for you and the family.

Sorry about the game.

It was not a good year for the Corn Boys and  Aggies.

Tom, 

Please handle this.  The deal is already out there for this time period.  You 
will probably need to send a zero nom.

Daren - During the Saxet Thompsonville outage, May 8 - May 11, the meter 
flowed a small volume with no nom.  Can you set up a deal for the days that 
flowed?

Attached is the Entex file I mentioned in the voice mail this morning.  We 
really need to have these adjustments made in POPS today.  Please let me know 
if you can help with this.  Thanks.

Daren

I have reviewed the Entex actuals and adjusted Gas Control's Entex factor for 
the month of May.  I have found that Entex estimates have been overstated by 
approximately 10.0 Mmcf/Day.

Romeo:

Will you make sure the estimates that are in POPs are corrected to reflect 
the new volumes.  This should help reduce some of the UA4 that Daren and Pat 
are trying to locate.  

The attached file has the changes that need to be made.  Please let everyone

Hi Daren,
I received an email from Kenny Soignet to make sure everything was in the 
system for me to pay Cannon on Friday, 5/19/00.
The deal # is 257141.  I see that the volume has not been scheduled, so 
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay.  
Are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me 
to pull up this deal?
( I see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5/00 production, does that 
matter? )

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

The purchase from Cannon is on Sitara deal # 257141 and the sale to CPR 
Storage is on Sitara deal # 257144.

Just wondering ... are you going to take any of the vacation days that you 
have written in the calendar for this week?

If you need it, I've got a contract brief that lists the transport cost and 
fuel from each location (there numerous receipt points).  It is possible that 
we may need to purchase extra gas for the plant on occasion.  In that case, 
we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other 
pipes also.  Any expense we incur to deliver gas to the plant will be passed 
on to the plant.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Kathy-----Here is what I know about Cornhusker:

Our supply comes from Apache & Williams

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or 
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.

For October, Tenaska IV should be paying us.  We bought gas from Apache and 
Williams on Lone Star Pipeline.  We sold that gas to Tenaska IV when the 
Cleburne plant was operating.  On days the plant was not operating, we sold 
that gas to other counterparties (the sales on Lone Star you see for ENA).  
For September, we may need to pay them an amount, but I need to check into 
that.  With the way this deal has been in the structuring process over a 
couple of months, there are some questions on how to handle Sep.  I'll let 
you know what I determine about Sep.

D

   

Daren:
Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal?  James Armstrong is 
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska 
IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them.  I do not see a 
deal in Path Manager for either month.  I also need some detail on who we are 
buying and selling this gas from and to.  There are a number of 
counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this 
deal.  Is there a schedule you can email to me?  James is looking for an 
answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be 
appreciated.

Bob, 

On the Texas desk, the majority of our deals are nominated manually (on Excel 
or preprinted forms), with most of the information pulled from Sitara instead 
of Unify.  So, these noms were not late.  For a couple of 3rd party 
pipelines, we do use Unify.  But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.  Our 
only problem was sending noms to HPL.  Which is sending information to 
yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline.  
This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Please provide Bob Superty with a list of pipelines whom were late or had

Please share with your organizations.

Last week you all received a memo from Brent Price which described changes 
within Gas Operations, excluding Texas.  Attached is an organizational chart 
for the Texas region.  

We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our 
customers.  We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage 
Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.  I am 
pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal 
Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos 
who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead 
position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group, 
continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook 
also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the 
next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.  
Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the 
Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under 
Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day 
responsibilities and projects are not cohesively aligned with this group.  
Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members 
who will continue in the group.

Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which 
includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory 
Reporting.  In addition, Clem Cernosek and Jennifer Pattison will be assuming 
new responsibilities in Logistics and Volume Management, respectively.  Both 
Clem and Jennifer have been on the Unify team, focused on POPS.  Please wish 
these folks success in their new roles.

All responsibility changes are effective 5/1/00.

Please share this with your staffs.

wired to Cannon Interest @ the corrected ABA on May 20th.

If I missed anyone who needs this information, please forward it.

Thanks,

Mike, 

What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few 
items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal 
with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is:

We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for 
each meter.

D

That's fine

   Aimee Lannou                04/25/2000 12:14 PM

Daren - Have you had a chance to check this out?  I know you are busy.  At 
least we can get a head start on May.

- Aimee
Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been 
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter 
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom 
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only 
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.  

Please let me know if this makes sense.

- Aimee

Aimee,
Please check meter #1591 Lamay gas lift.  It doesn't appear to have very much 
flow and the
BAV is showing the nom volume.  This could be adversely affecting the risk 
numbers.  Pat

This is the course.  The 7th is fine.  I also have Brandy looking into the 
tuition reimbursement deal.  Apparantly, the person she needs to talk to is 
out of the office.

Stacey Neuweiler   11/21/2000 04:36 PM

Daren-

There is an effective communication course on December 7 (Thursday) from 
1-5pm.  Is this the one you suggested for me, and if it is, may I attend this 
one?  Please let me know.  It is listed through Ernie and is $200.  Thanks 
for looking into this.

Go ahead and make those changes.

Daren,   Cody has a new well coming on Friday behind the 985333.  Right now 
we don't have any nominations at that meter so I'll get with vance on that .  
The increases according to the fax is going from 230@day to 1700 on friday 
and 1700 to 3200 on sat.  PRIZE Energy would like to make some changes,  

Meter

4028       from 1270 to 820          has been flowing from 600 to 800 this 
month

4965       from 112 to 45                has been flowing mid 80's this month 
                 from 97 to 104

Craig re-negotiated this deal, begining with April 2000.

D

   

Cheryl,

Do you have any documentation on a gas lift deal with Coastal?Engage? at 
meter 098-1520?  Thanks.  George x3-6992

Lauri A Allen
04/19/2000 02:40 PM
Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
(IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

   

I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal 
States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it 
has been allocated since March 1).  Did you want a premium rate for this?

I will not be in the office on Friday.

Katherine Herrera@ENRON
04/19/2000 05:29 PM
Daren and Brian,

Would you like for me to confirm the conference call that Duke has requested 
for Friday? 
I am available at anytime for this discussion.

Pls let me know.  
 
Katherine
We are trying for a conference call on Friday, April 21 at 10:30 CENTRAL time.
We are going to be discussing the HPL buy/sell agreement.  We are very close 
to
agreeing on procedures except for one issue:  the allocation of volumes at the
Fuels Cotton Valley delivery point and the Valero delivery point.  If you can
not make it please let me know ASAP.  If anyone has any questions please feel
free to call me at 303.605.1804.  Otherwise I will talk to all of you on 
Friday
at 10:30 CENTRAL.

Robert

Yes, you can create the deal ticket.

D

   Aimee Lannou                04/17/2000 10:56 AM

Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378 
for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation 
process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.  
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this 
done today.  Thanls.

Aimee:

The ENA 012-27049-02-002 and HPL 012-41500-02-016 contract are not at Meter 
378 for March 2000.  I need for you to put the correct deal number for both 
contracts in Path Manager.

We need the ENA 202 contract as a delivery and the HPL 216 as a receipt.  
Please get the deal in the System this morning and let me know what the deal 
numbers are and I will set up the arraignments and let you know what the 
Track ID's are.

Thanks,

Fred

Charlotte, 

I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on 
Channel.  Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL 
#6490. (Deals 83084 and 83088).  Why has this occurred each month?

D

   
	
	

No deal for March or April 2000................  but I have flow..... in 
March a total of   3804 flowed (delivery) and for April it's averaging about 
100/day as a delivery.   in February this was on the  213 contract, deal 
#83088 as a receipt at this delivery meter.  Do we have a deal at this city 
gate to sell Palacios this gas?

THANKS!!!

Charlotte

March is consistent with Feb.

03/31/2000 12:22 PM
As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our March price model. 
I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your 
costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please 
select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver 
for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver 
survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If 
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed 
data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list 
beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey 
every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone 
within your team beginning next month, please let me know.  

Please take this opportunity to verify the following:
1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to 
perform these activities for each commercial team.
2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified 
(please let us know otherwise)
3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or 
"80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not 
changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new 
allocation is).

In reference to these surveys, please note:
If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams 
listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business 
support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly 
among these teams.
The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out 
for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial 
team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).  

Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.  

Regards,
Shari

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

I have created deal 244531 to cover this flow.

Julie - This is actually volume related to the term deal 93804.  Volume 
flowed in March due to timing on changing the meter.  Can you attach the term 
contract to this deal?  (I copied the term deal to create the March ticket.)

D

   Aimee Lannou                04/14/2000 09:01 AM

Daren - I know you have been busy, but I left you a voice mail yesterday 
about meter 1517.  There was flow of 14 mmbtus on Mar. 1.  We have no deal at 
the meter until Mar. 14.  Could you either set up a new deal to cover this 
flow or extend the deal from Feb.? February's deal number was 93804.  Please 
let me know today.  Allocations close today.

Thanks.

- Aimee

Leave as is in Sitara.

04/14/2000 08:27 AM
This must be change day,  Shoreline would like to change meter 6886 from 490 
to 220.  Daily meter  actual show it's been running 398 on the 1st and  2nd 
and 6 mmbtu on the 3rd.  looks like it may be falling down.  Let me know 
Daren thanks. 

Just leave the nom as is in Sitara.  We will look at all wellheads next week.

Bill Moore called this morning and said he sent in a nomination change for 
the 15th on for meter 989826.  He would like to go from 1100 to 1250.  The 
daily meter volumes are ranging for the month from 1164 to 1334 Bill feels 
the 1250 will be the avg. Let me know what you think Daren.  thanks.

Gary thinks that we will not have any problems with this.

Are we going to have some quality problems with this gas?  EDG

Well- I have officially NOT heard from Hilcorp after numerous voice and email 
messages.  Please plan to have the gas rerouted back down the valley line for 
the Dec 1 forward.  Call if you have any questions-

Daren J Farmer
11/21/2000 10:08 AM
Thanks for the info.  I appreciated the call the other day.  It really helps 
me out to recieve info early like that.

D

   
	
	

According to Gary Hanks, we would like to have the gas on the valley line 
anyway
I can not believe you are sending emails form Hawaii!!!!  You are crazy.  I 
took care of Camden for the month-
It is now 330 and Hilcorp has not responded.  I spoke with Jerry Bubert 
several times today- emailed Mike LAnnou and left messages, and had him 
paged, and copied Hildebrand (the president).  If we don't hear by 4pm, we 
are supposed to bypass the gas...........

Charlotte Hawkins should be able to help you with this.

   
	
	

	

Daren,
I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you 
are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set 
up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.
  The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal 
was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using 
is
Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032 
).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.
( this was for 2/00 production )
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is 
something that I need to do.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Have you asked Karry Kendall about this meter?

Jackie Young
04/12/2000 02:38 PM
Daren,

Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I 
was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL.  
This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch.

Thanks

Jackie:

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert 
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily 
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and 
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jackie:

I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from 
Anita Luong.  In January 2000, and going forward, please make sure that 
Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002.  The contract is currently out of balance by the total 
volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning 
I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Fred

I rolled deal 128952.

Jackie Young
04/10/2000 05:10 PM
Here I go again....................

98-6373, Sitara deal #128952 expired 3/31/2000.

Flow for the following days are:

4/1 .461 decatherms
4/2 .453         "
4/3 .62           "

This meter has a 16-day chart.  Don't know if more volumes will show up later.

Help?

I have created deal tickets 241558 and 241560 for July 99 - March 00 based on

Are you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets 
for Equistar?  After talking with Bryan Hull and Anita Luong, Kyle and I 
decided we only need 1 additional sale ticket and 1 additional buyback ticket 
set up.
You'll may want to run this idea by Daren Farmer.  I don't normally add 
tickets into Sitara.

Tina Valadez
04/04/2000 10:42 AM
Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337 
below:

The pricing for the new buyback ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara 
#156342 below:

If you have any questions, please let me know.

I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Knig 
Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I 
forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of 
contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is 
negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we 
will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a 
gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.  
HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not be 
future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned 
from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything will 
be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different 
counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts 
and different counterparties.

Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss 
the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion 
also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper 
scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we 
be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling, 
transport rates and risk are affected.

Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.  

Thanks for the info! 

As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this 
restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00.  The impact is potentially 
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate 
transport/gathering agreements, etc.  If any rates are changing, then those 
need to be changed in our systems also.  There may be other areas of changes 
also - I'm not attempting to list them all.  Rather I just want to make 
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

Thanks for the information.

Pat/Daren:  Can you get with Mike and/or Brian to determine the potential 
impact, if any?  Thanks. 

   
	
	

Brenda,

Per your request, attached are the Draft documents which will be used to 
finalize the new  Gathering Arrangment between HPL and Coastal, the revenue 
sharing arrangement between Exxon and HPL (Transaction Agreement) and the 
Residue Gas Purchase Agreement between Coastal, as Seller and HPL as Buyer 
(Amendment to Wellhead purchase agreeement).  

I do not have a copy of the Processing Agreement between Exxon and Coastal, 
as such agreement does not involve us (and I believe it is far from 
finalized. The only other document that I plan to prepare is a termination 
agreement relative to the current Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between 
Exxon as purchaser and HPL as seller--this termination will be affective as 
of 4/1/2000.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.

Steve

Mtr 1600- A deal already exists for this meter (#159194).  If you view the 
meter in MOPS you can see the deal.  (It had zero volume before today.)

Mtr 6725 - This gas is traded on the spot market, so there is no deal to put 
in.

Jackie Young
04/06/2000 10:15 AM
Daren,

I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters:

98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was 
on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new 
deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.

98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new deal 
referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly 
and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied.

Thanks

Mtr 6725 - This meter is traded daily (spot) so, we can't extend the deal.  
When Elsa gets back next week, I will check with her to see if she did a deal 
with Encina on this day.

98-1534 is on the 215K for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in Sitara, 
on deal #163005.  Can you see if it is o.k. to extend the deal for the rest 
of the month?  It has flow every day after the 1st.

98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and 
covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to extend 
the deal to cover this day?

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517

Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)

Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).

(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

   

	
	                           
	

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

How are things going with this request?

FYI.  The majority of deals we transact on Oasis are done as HPLC.  Only 
sales to LCRA and term sales to Tufco are done as ENA.

Thanks.

Please forward this to whoever in the Pipeline group does transport, 
especially Oasis, and I disagree that it should be HPL cause most of the 
things off Oasis are ENA and will continue to be.

Dan, 

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to 
HPL.  Or, we need to enter into new agreements as HPL.  What is the process 
used to accomlish this?  We would like to get this set up as soon as we can.

Thanks.

Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary

Are you going to nom these volumes for the rest of the month?

D

   
	
	

Daren:

Just wanted to follow up with you on the April noms at Texas 
City..............   the volumes recorded for April 1 were 5300 and 1165...  
since we have been directed not to change Sitara deal tickets for now, would 
you please correct?

Thanks!!

Charlotte

	
	

For April 1, 2000:

Cross Media                         989815 =    903 MMBtu
TNCT                                      989816  = 5878  MMBtu

Any questions, just call.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks
-Jackie-

Jackie, any luck on the issue w/ the gas allocated to "stranger's gas" at 
this meter..........

	
	

Anita, have you found out any further information about this meter.  Encina 
still beleives that we owe them for this gas.

Thanks, Stephanie (3-6004) 

	Anita Luong
	03/03/2000 02:11 PM
	
Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.  

Thanks
	
	

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

	
	

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.

The deal for March was actually #210507.  I rolled it for one day.

Can you please see if you can roll deal 156657 for day 1 for April?

This deal expired 3/2000.  There was no new deal # referenced nor was the 
evergreen flag applied.

This meter flowed 556 MMBTU's on April 1, 2000.

Daren,

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Thanks

For volumes in excess of the 60,000 on our term agreement which were 
redelivered to HPL at Mobil Beaumont, we agree to pay Inside Ferc HSC-.045 
for the month of March.  The price at which HPL delivered the gas at Eastrans 
remains at Inside Ferc HSC-.04.

Daren Farmer

Our nomination into Eastrans is 75,000 MMBtu for 3/7/2000.

Redeliveries

7,000 MMBtu from FCV
50,000 into PG & E
3,000 at Carthage
15,000 at Mobil Beaumont

Per Brian Riley, the price for the incremental 15,000
above  60,000 will be per our Transaction Agreement,
(i.e., PanEnergy purchases 15,000 MMBtu at 1st of Month
HSC - $.04 and sells to HPL 15,000 at Monthly HSC - $.0375.

Please confirm the incremental 15,000 transaction.

Thanks.

For April, 

We agree to nominate 60,000 into Eastrans.  With redeliveries of:   50,000 
into PG&E
            7,800 into HPL at Fuels Cotton Valley
             2,200 to HPL at Carthage

Pricing for any additional volumes will need to be renegotiated.

You may contact either myself or Stacey Neuweiler.

Effective 4/1/2000:

Nomination into Eastrans of 75,000 MMBtu/d.

Redeliveries:

50,000 MMBtu/d into PG & E
7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
17,200 to HPL at Carthage

Currently, since 3/22/2000, we have been at 75,000
with the following redeliveries:

43,482 MMBtu/d into PG & E
7,000 from Fuels Cotton Valley
3,000 into HPL Cartwheel
21,518 to Mobil Beaumont

I previously showed 44,382 MMBtu/d since 3/22 .  Is 43,482 right?

There is no change in deliveries and redeliveries for tomorrow, but
could someone clarify what the nominations are on the redelivery side?

The buy and sale should net out, nothing to be billed to paid to TGLO.  The 
volumes should be the same on both sides.  Whoever backs up Tom should 
reallocate in POPS to make this happen.

We had to show a buy/sale in order to schedule the delivery to TGLO on a 
third party pipe.

Deal # 421859 Sales
Deal # 421847 Purchase

Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land 
Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for 
anything. 
Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together? 

 If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on 
deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus. 
Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be. 

FYI
I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be 
out until after Thanksgiving.

Were these deals confirmed?  What are the pipes and contracts?

in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara 
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

 There are only two deals on PGEV pipeline: Deal #156071- valid 02/01/00 - 
02/29/00, and Deal # 208083 - valid for 02/01/00 - 02/06/00.  Should there be

This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex 
line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, 
I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts 
from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the 
Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you 
may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL 
Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex 
line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy 
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

   Aimee Lannou                03/22/2000 01:24 PM

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the 
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party 
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to 
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let 
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

- Aimee
Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The 
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and 
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the 
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so 
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me 
know.

Thanks.

- Aimee
	
	

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our 
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the other 
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract 
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL 
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I 
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

ENA - Texas currently has tranport contracts on PGEV and Oasis pipelines 
(listed below).  Since we are transacting as Houston Pipe Line for the 
majority of our trades, we need these contractsto be assigned from ENA to

Thanks.

Stephanie,

The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I 
emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I 
am not sure who actually takes care of it.

	
	

Sherlyn,

 I believe this is your meter........
	
	

Thu,
I'm not sure if this is your meter or not.  If it is not, could you please 
pass this email on to the correct person.
For meter # 9814, Jan. 2000 production, the volume was allocated to the wrong 
company.  The gas was allocated to GMT Company Inc., but it should have been
allocated to GMT, Inc.  For Feb. 2000 it is done correctly.
I need to recoup the money from GMT Company, so could you please let me know 
when the change has been made in the system.
Thanks for your help.

has gone out to the Houston company? Please include the amount.

George x3-6992

Nick, it appears that we paid GMT Company, Inc. (BA 01474) of Corpus Christi 
instead of GMT, Inc. (BA 75046) of Houston.  These companies are not 
related.  We should pay the Houston GMT for production at meter 098-9814.  
Would you please make the necessary adjustments?  Thanks.

I was looking in Unify for last month and this invoice was finalled under the 
GMT Company Inc for 15975 mmbtu at meter 0989814.  The check was sent to 
their Corpus Christi address.  The Sitara# was 153864.  The Sitara # you gave 
me is showing February as the beginning month with GMT, Inc. as the payee.  
Do you know if these are different companies?
Cynthia Hakemack@ECT
03/02/2000 04:07 PM
Nick, Can you please handle this?

Cindy, GMT has advised Brian that they have not yet received payment for 
production at meter 098-9814 for the period from 1/14/2000 to 1/31/2000.  
Would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible?  It 
appears that the January deal was 156292 and I believe GMT produced 15,984 
Mmbtu in January.

George x3-6992

Vic, attached is a Physical Well Connect form authorizing you to turn-on the 
GMT Tillison #1 well.  We expect this production to commence either late 
today or tomorrow at Meter 098-9814.

Nathan, WO C59605 on its way to you.

George x3-6992

Brian, for your information.  Please note Robert's cautionary warning with 
respect to additional wells that GMT may want to drill and add to this 
meter.  Does GMT have additional drilling plans?  If so, should we alert them 
to the gas quality issue early on?

George x3-6992
Robert D Morgan
01/12/2000 10:04 AM
Although the gas is non-spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough 
that it can be blended okay before reaching Beaumont.  GO FOR IT.

As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.  
Once we connect a well, we can't go backwards.  Please be specific with GMT 
and limit him to this one well.  Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow 
them ALL through this new meter.

I have created deal 222844 to cover this meter.  The deal ticket has zero 
volume.  Just allocate the actuals at the end of each month.

Done.

FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the 
delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This 
should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, 
we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a

Robert,

I've taken care of 98-6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation 
exception screen).  I'm going to place 98-9676 on Strangers Gas until you 
hear back from Daren or Julie.

Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back 
w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie) 
as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my 
allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting 
arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter.

It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that the 
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.

We have a purchase deal in the system, 205116, for Feb. 2000 production that 
Amoco does not show.  Can you tell me the trader's name at Amoco that the 
deal was done with?

Megan  

George, 

Are you looking into these variances?

D
The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.

Patty Boling from Vintage called and wanted to know why her nom was at 630 
for the first when it should be 320.  This was one of the ones that the 
system pushed the Jan numbers over.   We have it changed back to the 320 from 
the 9th on due you want me to change the volumes from the 1st to  the 8th 
from 630 to 320. Let me know.

Hold off on changing the noms.  Let's see how they flow over the weekend and 
decide on Monday or Tuesday on whether to make adjustments or not.

Daren, EOG  called and said that the well behind 986296 which has been down 
for a week from 7100 to 4400 for the last week or so needs to stay at the 
4400  for the rest of the month.  I  changed the ticket for that.  This was 
per Suzanne Saldivar.  Also Shoreline reduced the meter 6722 from 30 to 24.  
also changed that. last Cody went from 7666 to 7600 at meter 6722.  Both 
Shoreline and Cody were per customer request.

Aimee,

There is a feedback error on swing meter 981595, deal number 151203 for 
January 2000.  POPS and MOPS systems match, however in checking in Sitara, 
the deal number attached expired 12/31/99.  

I am not sure you are the correct person to address this with, if not, please 
let me know.  If you can fix this problem, please do so and let me know.

Hey Sweet Baby!

Can you answer this?

I love you.
HEY! Tonya said to staple copy B of the W-2 to the tax return--But on the
one from camp it says Copy C for payer or State Copy, Copy B for Recipient
(Keep for your records).  So which one do I send?  The one from the school
says send B but I'm confused on the other one.
What did the doctor say about Tonya & the due date? Love, Ma

Hey Ken,

Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you, but...We've had an 
interesting couple of weeks here.  Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some 
time off (I think that this is the 4th week).  So, we have picked up his 
trades.  Tom restructured the EOL trading.  Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I 
have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.  (I'm still 
responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during 
trading.)  In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.  And, of 
course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).  
He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.  I 
don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.  I am getting very 
frustrated with the whole business.  It doesn't see that he even appreciates 
the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.  
Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest. 

Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.  I think that baby is going to come 
along any day now (due date is still 3/18).  We are both definitely ready.  
The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.  That's just 
too bad.  (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.  I've got a real 
quick answer to that.)

How are things at home?  Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?  I 
just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.  If 
things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for 
extra cash!  It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter.  
(Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.)

The grant price on the employee options is $55.50.

I hope everything is going good for you.  I would like to have lunch with you 
sometime.  I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do 
that.  Or...I can give you a call when I'm out for paternity leave and we can 
go one day then.  Talk to you later.

D

I extended both deals.

Daren,

I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close 
week for Volume Management.

98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30 
decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate 
2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000 
production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I 
see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the 
ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled 
differently.  

98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K 
applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal 
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has 
the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen 
flag or a new deal number).  

Thanks

Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.

Stella,
This is Fred's meter but I helping him out.   Can you please extend 2 deals 
at meter 9643.

114096  HPL Resources Liquids Division ( for 1/2000 only)
93210  Cactus Swift (for 1/2000 and 2/2000)

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks

The meters in question are : 616, 894, 2538, 2690, 3396.

Mtrs 616 and 2538 are shrinkage and condensate meters.  Volumes are split 
among HPLR Liquids and HPLC, with the majority going to Liquids. 
Mtr 894 is a gas loss meter.  Volume should be allocated to our operational 
ua4 contract.
Mtrs 2690 and 3396 should be allocated to Liquids.

You can see these allocations by viewing prior months in POPS.  On Monday 
afternoon, Clem Cernosek will verify the above transactions and expain the 
split between parties at 616 and 2538.

I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made 
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having 
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least 
6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a 
HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this 
information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input 
reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes.

We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet 
been entirely corrected.

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

D

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Megan

Can you please extend sitara deal #156657 for 3/1/00, if the deal will 
allow?  It was transported on the 215K, which was the only one out there for 
2/00.

It spilled over into March on day 1 for .423 dec.

Thanks

In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR 
Liquids at King Ranch.  This allocation resulted in a large physical 
unaccounted for loss.  Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our 
systems.  In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been 
zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in 
additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.  I have 
attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in 
February.  This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will 
need to be adjusted.  I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should 
have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for 
February.  See the following:

Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574  18,606/day
Purch by HPLC @ WH:  379,108  13,073/day
Incorrect Liquids Sale:    72,500  2,500/day
     Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986  3,034/day

We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the 
tailgate.  We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.

The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch 
plant through HGPL.  Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC, 
some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three 
producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or 
to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the 
plant.  It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated 
correctly among parties related to these transactions.  The attached schedule 
should assist in doing this.  I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys 
wellhead gas.  The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be 
kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.  A transport usage 
ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.

Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.  Let me know 
what works best for you.

FYI
Mary M Smith
03/02/2000 04:27 PM
Heidi, yes let's check the rates on the transport usage tickets.  Daren, is 
supportive of this decision.  Thanks, Mary

   

The rates are in the system correctly in Unify (so that we can invoice 
correctly), but Daren's group uses a Sitara deal (the transport usage 
tickets) to estimate desk transport in the P&L during the month.  Right now 
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets.  
Our group has not taken that step, since we have been most concerned with 
settling the G/L (after the month is over).  By not having the right rates on 
the transport usage tickets, the risk is that the P&L will be off during the 
month.  Would we change process and let Daren set up the transport usage 
ticket and then have us enter the rate?  If so, we would need to change the 
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the 
correct rate.  Please let me know what you want to do.

Mary M Smith
03/02/2000 03:14 PM
Heidi, we need to ensure the rates are correct on all meters (HPLC/ENA for 
Texas) and that the rates are in the right system.

   

FYI...the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much 
the marketing desk spent in transport.  They can get their expense numbers 
either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates 
in.

One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the 
transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage 
tickets.  I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right 
now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back 
to Lauri's matrix.  For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville 
to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.055.  
This means the economic estimate can be off.  Let me know what you want to do 
with this.

I made the following industrial changes for March 3rd:

Chevron  decreased to 9500/day.  This should remain for the rest of the month.

Lyon-Citgo increased to 34,000.  This is an increase of 10,000 that will need 
to be rolled daily until further notice.

Shell Cogen increased by 5,000 to 45,000.  This will need to be rolled daily 
until further notice.

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Do you mean 12,000 at 6789?  If so that's fine.  Go ahead and bring the Yates 
down also.

Tom Acton@ENRON
03/02/2000 04:00 PM
Daren , I think I may have lost my mind ( no comment Vance) but did I talk to 
you about meter 6789 taking that volume from 12079 to 1200.  Also Yates has 
averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me 
know what you think.  Husker TOM.

It's fine with me to allocate everything to Torch if they are paying for it.

Parker thinks that all of this volume should be under Torch...  What do you 
think?

	
	

Kim,
Have you looked at this yet?

Have you heard anything on this yet?  I need to pay it by Thursday.

Megan
	
	

I have a volume issue with meter 986315 for 1/00 production.  The volume has 
been split between El Sordo and Torch Rally.  I think all of the volume 
should be under Torch Rally.  Please let me know if you find something 
different.  The old months have already been corrected.

Thanks,
Megan

Tom, 

For the EOG piece, bring the nom down to 4400 through the 7th.  For the 8th 
forward, leave the nom as is.  When we get more information next week, we can 
adjust as necessary.

Yates - What did they produce in Jan and Feb?  Let me know that and we can 
decide if we want to adjust the nom. 

Vintage - Adjust our nom to tie with Vintage.

Tom Acton@ENRON
03/02/2000 10:12 AM
 Daren,  EOG  is having problems with that same well 6296 but this time it's 
compressor problems.  They think that it will be for at least a week but you 
know how that goes.  They would like to drop the volume again to 4400.  If we 
change don't Kim will have an imbalance at this meter (she wanted me to let 
you know that).  Meter # 6598 YATES  would like to change the volume from 
4206 to 3366, and Vintage who had been over producing last month would like 
to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow.  I know these are 
bothersome changes but I'm trying to get the best numbers for both you and 
Vance for the up coming month.  Let me know and I'll be on the go  from the " 
THE TOM CAT"

That's fine.  Go ahead and change the deal if you need to.

I changed the price to 2.85.  With the changes in personnel on the desk, we 
don't have a lot of info to dispute their price.  It's not cost beneficial to 
do so anyway.

Hesco is showing a price of $2.85 for tne 29 & 30

Daren J Farmer
11/15/2000 10:33 AM
Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

D

Charlene Richmond
11/09/2000 01:37 PM
Daren would you look at the price for 29 and 30th of March 2000 .  There are 
no prices for these days but volume was scheduled for these days.
Thanks
Charlene

Daren J Farmer

Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

This gas purchase is not a part of the wellhead portfolio but is being traded 
on the Texas desk.  I would suggest you get with Darren Farmer or someone on 
the desk.

Sorry I could not be of more assistance!

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has 
changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran 
into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she 
would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not 
confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want 
950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a 
change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin 
Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for 
the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat 
!!! 

THis is to nominate 65,000 MMBtu/d for 3/1 from HPL to Eastrans.

7,000 MMBtu will come from Fuels Cotton Valley.
58,000 MMBtu will be delivered to PG & E.

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at 
o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each 
month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be 
distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

D

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of 
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your 
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a 
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we 
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark 
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a 
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We 
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to 
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824), 
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746). 

Call me if you have any questions.

The purchase from Swift was shown at mtr 3405 during Dec and Jan.  I have 
created a new deal (#204777) to add mtr 9643 to the deal.

Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.  This purchase is on 138544 
for Jan 2000 forward.

D

   
	
	

Fred is trying to set up accounting arrangments to cover the Swift deal.  Can 
you please verify that you made this purchase from Swift?  If so, is there 
another deal to replace deal #114096 of should this deal be extended into 
January.    If I should forward this to someone else, please let me know.  

Thanks for you help, Stella

Fred Boas
02/24/2000 11:25 AM
Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

I know we transported on Midcon due to problems with the plant at the point.  
I am not sure about the rate.

Midcon is billing us $.05 from Katy to Cogen.

Lauri A Allen
02/24/2000 01:57 PM
Kellie-

I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in 
Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street 
for $.04/mm for the months of August and September.

The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen 
Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows 
a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It 
was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this 
haul?

Thanks.

Mandy MacKinnon
02/24/2000 03:10 PM
FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business 
transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field 
Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at 
that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be 
moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when 
they bought it back in June or July.

If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check 
with the Global contracts dept.

Mary Poorman@ENRON
11/15/2000 02:55 PM
Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary

Bruce, 

I need to hold the deliveries to 60,000 for 2/24.  I'm somewhat limited on my 
transport right now.  I will look into the possibility of increasing the 
volume, though.  If you can increase the deliveries at Fuels Cotton Valley, 
that will work.

Daren

I meant 2/24/2000 as the effective date of this nom.
Bruce McMills
02/23/2000 08:55 AM

Please incerease deliveries to Eastrans to 65,000 MMBtu/d eff 2/23/2000.

7,000 will come from Fuels Cotton Valley.
Maintain sale of 500 MMBtu/d.
Increase PG & E nom to 58,000 MMBtu/d.

The agreement provides for up to 60,000 MMBtu at our option.
Brian Riley needs to approve the increase to 65,000 MMBtu/d.

Got your message.  Jo won't have your tax figured out until we get the 
Langston #.  But, she will be able to give you an idea soon.  The curtains do 
look good.  We are going to have to get a shade to use also, though.  The sun

You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra 
gas on the 14th and 15th.  If they were, we can change the deal.  If not, the 
pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day.

Daren,

Stacey is out of the office today, I hope you can help.  Deal 107937 was 
originally set up for 155,000, but the nom was changed to 140,000.  I show 
5,000 was purchased from Conoco, where did HPLC get the additional 135,000?  
Sitara shows HPLC IM Wellhead.    Joanie Ngo says TXU is saying they bought 
155,000.   I am trying to back track to the purchase invoices to see what we 
were invoiced.  

FYI.  Due to this shut-in, I have taken deal 135714 to zero for the 
17th-29th.  If you hear of this point coming back into service, please notify 
me.

D

Meter 0984179 Hoff Heller Unit #22 CDP was shut-in at approximately 9:20 AM 
today (February 17, 2000).  

On Wednesday, February 16, the meter was found flowing 25 lb dew point gas.  
The pumper was given 24 hours to correct the problem.  On February 17, the 
meter was found flowing 40 lb dew point gas.

Rita and Lisa, 

Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would 
work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early 
afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the 
HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help 
with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas 
where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.)  

I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you 
want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything.  
Let me know.  

D

As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from 
the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.  Due to 
bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99.  
(I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.)  Please see the deal #s 
below.

Teco  113858 &169759
HPLR Liquids  114099 & 169765   (existing deal to cover excess residue)
Swift  93779 & 169761
ERAC  138094 & 169760
Tejones 133173 & 169762

Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR 
Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.

Let me know if you have any questions.

D

You need to get with Aimee and George on this.

George-

In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the 
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well 
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing 
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may 
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently 
show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King 
Ranch.  

Thanks.

The old swing deals should not be used for October.  Please have Volume 
Management allocate any volumes on the old deals to the new deals.

I noticed the new October deals for Valero (414065, 414074, 414071) include 
both the base Index pricing and the swing Gas Daily pricing.  However, the 
old swing deals (148386, 148391, 148382) are still valid through October.   
Should these deals be effective for October?

Thanks for your help.

   Aimee Lannou                02/17/2000 10:01 AM

Daren - Could you please create a new deal or extend the existing one for 
meter 1520 for Jan. 00?  The deal number is 95551 for Engage Energy.  The 
deal ended 12/31/99.  I am helping volume management creat an accounting 
arrangement.

Thanks.  Aimee

jACKIE, 

You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra

Heidi, 

I expect the wellhead volumes to be around 625,000 to 650,00 per day.

D

   

We have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to 
analyze the Producer Services portion of the P&L.  To do this, we have been 
looking at daily volumes on the 96026572 contract.  POPS shows a daily BAV of 
approximately 612,000.  MOPS shows a daily BAV of approximately 601,000.  I 
wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you.  By the way, 
it also looks like the noms for the gathering contract are a lot higher, 
around 750,000 per day.

Please advise as to how you feel these BAv's come in compared to what you 
expect.  Thank you.

Heidi

Where are these meters?  What is happening?  What have we done in the past?

D

   Aimee Lannou                02/16/2000 02:58 PM

Daren - Meters 3002 and 3003 have volume from Jan 99 thru the current month.  
Could a deal be created for these volumes? There is a substanital amount of 
volume each month.

Stella:

I set up the accounting arrangement on the HPLR transport contract 
012-64610-02-052 for January through June per Daren's instructions below.  
The tracking ID for all 6 months is 34500.

I also set up accounting arrangement on the HPLC transport contract 
012-41500-02-015 for July per Daren's instructions below.  The tracking ID 
for July is 34501.  If you would, please put the transport contract in POPS 
on Monday morning and call me when your done so that I can reallocate the 
meters.  I need to call Copano to tell them that their payment is on the way.

I need the transport contracts, HPLR and HPLC put in for all 31 days of each 
of the respective months.

As always thanks in advance for your help,

Fred

Daren J Farmer
08/20/99 04:50 PM
Fred, 

I had the typed the deal numbers incorrectly.  July forward is on 93481.  
January-June is on 69176.

Daren

Fred Boas
08/20/99 12:56 PM
Daren:

I looked in Path Manager and I see two deals - 93480 and 93481, but I don't 
see deal 69176 for July forward that you mentioned below.  Also, please 
verify that the deal for January through June is 93481 and if the 69176 deal 
is correct for July forward.

Stella:

I will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from January 
forward.  From Daren's note below it appears that for January through June I 
will need an HPLR transportation contract put in POPS.  When Daren and I get 
the deal number issue resolved for July forward I will need an HPLC contract 
put into POPS.  Also for July forward, I will need the HPLC contract in POPS 
every month through December to allocate Copano line gain to if it occurs.

Thanks to both of you,

Fred

Daren J Farmer
08/19/99 11:16 AM
Fred, 

I have pathed the purchase from Copano for 1999 in MOPS.  Jan-Jun is under 
HPLR (Sitara 93481).  July forward is under HPLC (Sitara 69176).  I 
understand that I cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months, because the 
callout allocations will be affected.  So, you will need to set up accounting 
arrangements to get the nom into POPS.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren

Fred Boas
08/19/99 08:01 AM
Stella/Daren:

What is the status of this request?  Please let me know when I can reallocate 
this meter, the customer has not been paid for 3 months and is complaining.

Fred

Thanks for your help Robert.

Thanks again, Stella

Daren- FYI.  There are deal tickets in Sitara to cover this transaction- 
#69176 for HPLR and #93481 for HPLC- but they have zero volume and were not 
pathed in Unify.  Could you get someone in your group to set these up for 
Fred, please?  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
Fred Boas
08/12/99 11:19 AM
Stella:

I need the above referenced contract put into POPS for January, May, June , 
July, and August 1999 forward.  I need the contract in POPS for August 
forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.

In 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South 
Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number 
of 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by 
Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began 
allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and 
yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail 
indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - 
Global # 96022367 (I don't have a "Synergi" contract number).  I know that in 
3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.

I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so 
that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated 
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most 
knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be 
directed to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki 
at Copano to set up the contract originally.

Thanks,

Fred

   Thanks! Heather, x33278

Yvette, 

Where is this offsite taking place?  I know you told in the meeting the other 
day, but I didn't write it down.

D

I would like to talk about what we can do to make sure that effective 
training occurs in the future for new hires/transfers.  For example, we are 
giving an HPL training session today.  We should not have to give another 
full blown session in the future.  The group should be able to take this 
knowledge, add to it, and pass it on to others entering the group.  With the 
rate of turnover we have experienced in the past, it seems like some 
knowledge has been lost.

D

Stella and Charlotte, 

I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the 
path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated 
and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a 
bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that 
the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy 
should have been found before we closed out January.

I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id 
in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).  
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, 
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the 
problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an 
explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas 
was confirmed for the 27th-31st.

Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the 
OBA.  Unless you can find a missing transport contract.

D

   
	
	

FYI
	
	

Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need 
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.

Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

D

Charlene Richmond
11/09/2000 01:37 PM
Daren would you look at the price for 29 and 30th of March 2000 .  There are 
no prices for these days but volume was scheduled for these days.
Thanks
Charlene

Daren J Farmer
11/02/2000 02:59 PM
Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

This gas purchase is not a part of the wellhead portfolio but is being traded 
on the Texas desk.  I would suggest you get with Darren Farmer or someone on 
the desk.

Sorry I could not be of more assistance!

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice

Mom, 

That sounds good.  You can bring the curtains when you come.  What time do 
you think you can make it down here on Friday?  We will probably be leaving 
farily early to go to the rodeo (about 5:00).  We can have the girl across 
thestreet take care of Cole until you get there.

Daren

Hey!  The curtains look good--I hope they do when they are hung-- Lacy & I
are planning to come next Friday the 18th. when ya'll go to the rodeo.  I'm
taking a personal day from the bus and leaving early. Thought I would bring
them. Answer & let me know if that's ok.  If you need them before then I'll
try to get them mailed.  Hope sweet Cole is feeling better over his cold.
Love you, Mom

Daren.  I need a nom at this meter for Feb (entex)
thanks.  kim

Also, could you switch the meter 6572 noms for the  past few days to the new 
logical 7346..  thank you.

Tom, 

I changed the meter on deal 156161 from7012 to 7341.  You will need to repath 
and renom this in MOPS.  Also, you will need to make sure that the welhead 
meteres are linked to 7341 in POPS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

D

Tom Acton@ENRON
02/09/2000 08:41 AM
Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter 
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under 
Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be 
under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move 
them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a southern 
term!!)

We have no way to input a storage deal for Cilco.  The way that the contract 
is set up, does not fit into the systems as they are.

D

   Aimee Lannou                02/04/2000 09:31 AM

Daren - Can you set up a deal for the Cilco withdrawal for Dec. 99 going 
forward?  I know a deal has never been set up for this but volume management 
wants a deal set up so they won't have to set up an accounting arrangement 
evey month.  Please let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks.

Aimee

Please plan on attending a training session over lunch on Tuesday, Feb 15th.  
(Lunch will be provided.)  I intend to discuss the operations of Houston Pipe 
Line;  how gas is moved through the system, where our main supply and market 
areas are, locations of specific points, etc.  We will be using a map of the 
pipeline as the basis for the discussion.  So, come to the meeting with any 
questions you have on HPL, anything is fair game.

Yvette is currently working on securing a room.  I will let you know when 
that is finalized.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Carey told me that he has already talked to Jennifer.  He should be able to 
give you any information you need.

Daren

Tuesday the 15th is fine.  I will get a conference room and lunch set up.  We 
can start at 11:30.  I will send out an e-mail invitation to everyone in your 
group, my group and the risk group.  If you want to add anything or if you 
have something specific you want me to cover, just let me know.

Daren

Check out the following dates/times for a training session on HPL 
operations/gas flows/points.  I would allow about 2 hours to cover all 
questions. We may only need an hour.

Thurs 2/10  any time after 1pm
Fri        2/11  Lunch to earlier afternoon
Mon    2/14  11:00am-1:00pm
Tues   2/15 Lunch to 2:30

Let me know the best time for you and your group.  I am also going to invite 
the risk group (their schedule is flexible).

D

Howard, 

The Park  and Ride deals should be booked to a transport contract.  Desk to 
desk deals should be on the transport contract also.

D

Howard B Camp
01/27/2000 10:17 AM
Daren,
Just a quick note to follow up on UA4 issues.

For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not 
a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the 
backscreen.

On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal 
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a 
subsequent month.
If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co 
89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope 
you have some insight on this issue.

Let me know
HC

Mike, 

Thursday the 17th at 1:00 wil work for me.  I have reserved room 3125b.  We 
can meet at my desk (3138C) and walk over there.

Daren

Michael (or Mike..what do you like to be called?),

My schedule is open Thursday afternoon 1-5pm and Friday 1-4pm.  Let me know 
the what works best for you.  Earlier in the afternoon is usually best for me.

Daren

Jackie Young
02/04/2000 03:28 PM
Daren,

The above mentioned meter (delivery) shows a small flow of 24 dec. on 
2-1-00.  The sitara deal (151694) has a stop date of 1/31/2000.

Can you please extend the deal thru 2-1-00 to cover this small volume?

Thanks
-Jackie-

Aimee, 

We don't enter 3rd party storage deals in Sitara.  You may want to talk to 
Kenny Soignet, but I thought that storage contracts were entered manually in 
POPS.

days.  Last deal used was for Oct. - 413538, counterparty Southern Union.  
Will you let me know if you set a deal up for this?

Daren - Deal # 97929, meter 1450 expired Nov. '99.  Is there a way for you to 
extend the deal or create a new one since there seems to be a little bit of 
flow each month?

- Aimee

Fred Boas
02/03/2000 02:02 PM
Aimee:

There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The 
reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine 
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it?

To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you 
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to 
put the deal on.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Fred

Hey, Mom.  I got your message.  Just send the curtains whenever you get the 
chance.  Jo went to the doctor yesterday and everything is looking good.  She 
is going to start going to the doctor weekly.  Carrying the baby pretty low, 
so he's getting ready.  Jo thinks he'll be coming around the first part of 
March, the doctor didn't say that, though.  Anyway, tell Lacy "Good Luck".  I 
love ya'll.

Wanted to let you know that there are still two sitara deals that need to 
have the expected volume brought down to "0" of the list that I previously 
sent you.
They are 114099 and 92918.

I appreciate you revising the ones that you have and you probably were going 
to handle the above two today.  In case you were please disregard this 
notice.  If you had fogotten, this can serve as reminder.

Daren,

 I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your 
help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for 
you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the 
purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s).  
The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has 
been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has 
desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be 
scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters.

Congrats, Boy

Jackie and Stella, 

I need ya'll to get together and work out how to handle this at Stratton.  I 
know that we get the estimated volume from Exxon daily and I would think that 
this volume will need to be allocated among the different deals.  But, Exxon 
will not have them broken out.

Can you please "0" all activity on Sitara Deal Tickets 113858, 93779, 138094, 
120866, 138544, 139661 (relative to 98-3405)?  This activity is now being 
nomed @ 98-9643.  I think that I've referenced all of the deal tickets @ this 
meter.

Thanks

I can meet tomorrow from 1pm-3pm or Thusday after 1pm.

Daren,

 I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your 
help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for 
you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the 
purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s).  
The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has 
been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has 
desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be 
scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters.

Thu

Thu, 

I would be happy to join you in these type of meetings, but I can never meet 
before 11:00.  We begin trading each day at 8:30 am.

D

   
	
	

Just a reminder, we are have the meeting today at 8:30 in EB3749.  

  Daren, if you have time, please join us in this meeting.  You may be able 
to help us resolve some of these issues.  Thanks

Thu

Please plan to attend this meeting on MidTex Pipeline, which will cover the 
scheduling of HPL's transportation expense on MidTex and purchases off of 
this pipeline.

O'Neal:  This relates to the deals I have asked you to modify.  If you have 
further questions, they can be address at the meeting.  

  Room:  EB3749
  Time:  8:30 - 9:30
   
Thanks

Thu

Can we start this meeting later?  We will be trading until 10:30.  Since Greg 
McClendon is out of the office, Carey Metz is trading basis for him.  Because 
Carey is doing that, Stacey is needed to trade Waha.  And she is my backup on 
managing our position.  So, I need to be on the desk during trading.

Daren

   
	
	

Please plan to attend a Texas Budget Meeting this Friday, February 4th, from

Daren,

The above meter began flow on 1/25/00 w/a volume of  295 decatherms versus 
the start date of the 26th as indicated on Sitara deal ticket 148923.

Can you please notify me as to whether the deal ticket will reflect this 
change?

Thanks

FYI.  We need to make sure that this kind of communication conitinues to flow 
downstream.

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.

Thanks

I rolled the deal for Jan and Feb.

EGPFC nominates the following requirements for the MTBE Plant at Morgan's 
Point for February 2000:

This has been corrected.  A transport usage ticket should have been used, 
instead of a desk to desk.

Daren,

The above mentioned receipt meter is on the 215K (Sitara #152638) beginning 
the 21st day of January 2000.  The actual flow date @ this meter began on 
January 1.  Can you please show the start-date in Sitara as 1/1/2000?

I don't know if this information is of any help but 12/99's business @ this 
meter was on the 215K as well.

I am not available at that time.   I have 2 meetings already scheduled for

Daren

So sorry....

I do not know who exactly to send this email to....

I do not know whose HPL nom files these are.  Whoever was trying to send noms 
to HPL between 4:16pm and 5pm on Thursday 1/20/2000, your noms did not get 
uploaded into POPS.  Please re-send if you have not already.

The production unix machine we process the edi noms on ran out of space.  
When the machine runs out of space, it pages me, but unfortunately no data 
can be saved in the edi files.

I was trying to free up space and after I was done (like 1 hour later, ie. 
6pm), did I notice that these nom files had zero data in them.  Because they 
have zero data in them, I do not know what gas dates or contracts were 
suppose to be in the file which is why I do not know if these are ECT, HPLR, 
HPLC.

We are suppose to get a bigger unix box installed the weekend of 2/5/2000.  
This running our of space has only happened twice in the past year that I 
remember and that it affected the edi processes in some way on those 
occasions.

Call me if you think these files are yours and you need some help in knowing 
how to re-send.

Attached are two spreadsheets showing Entex data for Dec. 99.

Jan00_factor shows the difference between the estimates that should have fed 
over to POPs and the actual for all meters in the meter set {2001-2500, 2540, 
3509, 3519, 3530, 3533, 6822, 9544}.  I do not have the actual for Vidor CG 
yet.  I have estimated the volume to be 190.00.

Actuals were 6105.26 Mmcf using the Vidor CG estimate
Estimates were 4870.37 Mmcf. 
Difference of 1237.89 Mmcf.  (About 1,250,000 Mmbtu)

Jan00_scada shows that if we had correct information from the Hempstead CG 
RTU the difference would have been 819.186 Mmcf.

If you have any questions please call.

I think I hate football too.  4th and goal on the 3 yard line, to win the 
game, and RC decides to change his lifelong coaching strategy from run, run, 
run, to pass the ball.  Why not Ja'mar??  The guy who carried 3 defenders 
into the end zone earlier.  Anyway, we beat the spread and I got $20 from 
your friend Mary.  So things are not all bad.

How did the Corn boys lose?  If I would have known about it on Saturday, I 
would have called to console you and the family.  Maybe it's time to just 
turn our attention to the NBA and leave this heartache behind.

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI

Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?  We no longer do business on 
Enron Field Services.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved  We should 
have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved  
We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?  Carlos is looking into 
this.

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved  Carlos nom'd this to 
Channel.  He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

Aimee, 

I assume that you are looking into this.

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave 
Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to 
find out if it would be something worth putting into production.
Thanks.

The above meter is non-allocatable and was off system, actuals at meter #8693.
Thanks, Stella

	
	

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

Sherlyn, 

The base purchase should be brokered with the base sale.  Deal 135563 does 
not replace the basse purchase ticket, it is in addition to that one.  On the 
days where deal 135563 is applicable, the purchases and sale should balance 
out;  no flow.

D

Daren,

Is this a buy/sell?   If not what transport contract do I use?  I also see a 
deal 135563 purchasing from Phillips.  This new deal is not to replace that 
one is it?   I just  noticed it was for 6000/day.

Thanks.

Daren J Farmer

At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips 
sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 
10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.  
So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these 
changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you 
have any questions, let me know.

D

Ken, 
Thanks for your input.  I will definitely take this into consideration.

Also, I want you to know that I really do appreciate all that you've done for 
me.  I have greatly benefited from your knowledge of the market and industry; 
and also from your experience of just dealing with people and issues.  It has 
been very nice having someone to discuss ideas with and to learn from (and 
argue with!).  Thanks, also, for your honesty and openness.  I really 
appreciate you telling me when you disagree, it helps me see things from a 
different view.  (I just want to do the best thing for our business, and you 
help me to do that.)  You don't try to slip anything by, and you take 
responsibility for your work/actions.  That's hard to find these days.  I 
just wanted to let you know that.  Thanks.

But, I will still continue to think of you as in that Dilbert cartoon:  
"Whenever we disagree, I always end up yelling.  That's an indication that 
you have poor interpersonal skills." 

D

Should the entire volume be moved over to ICC now?  Currently on deal 131478 
(ICC), 10,000 is being sold at 2.84.  The sale on the TXU ticket has been 
zeroed out on the deal line, but needs to be reallocated in Vol Mgmt.  If I 
need to move the additional 25,000 to ICC, I will.  But, I want to make sure 
that is what we need to do.

Aimee, 

If you review that deal in CPR, you can see that this is a desk to desk deal 
on ECT.  This is actually our transport of Waha gas on PGE, delivered into 
HPL.  So, the volume should be scheduled/allocated to the ECT intrastate 
contract 012-27049-201.

Someone in Producers Services.  You can call Vance Taylor and he can probably

Who is the Trader that handles Cox exploration?  My experience in the past 
says the trader would prefer to make the call.

Mandey, 

The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas coming 
to us from them.  The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted. The Tribo 
deal is good.  If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.  (I don't think they 
have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.)  Carlos probably has a contat 
with Cox.  Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of 
their interests.

D

Mandy MacKinnon
01/10/2000 11:05 AM
Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve.

Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E 
Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase 
agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I 
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at 
Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to 
be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this 
gas.

We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not 
know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to 
reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm 
and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the 
producer level.

Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at 
the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected 
volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest 
in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas 
after all.

At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips 
sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 
10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.  
So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these 
changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you 
have any questions, let me know.

A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract 
for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November 
and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract.  
Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to

Hi Julie, I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with.  I have a 
new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have 
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a 
total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter # 
9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the 
deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and 
he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  In 
order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???

Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Last month Richard Burchfield sent us the following list of reports that are 
available from CES's systems.  IT is working on a way to secure an electronic 
copy of the required reports and making them available to us online via the 
electronic document management system.  While ENA is not liable for pre-2000 
business, we may need to assist with research as issues arise.  In order to 
get the ball rolling, we need to get a list together of the reports we need.  
Please fill out the attached spreadsheet and list any reports that you need 
and return it to me by Friday, 1/15/2000.  If you do not want any reports, 
please send me an Email letting me know that.  I have included samples of how 
to fill this out, and if you have any questions please give me a call.

If you aren't sure which reports you need based on the names, please get with 
any CES employees you have hired or with a CES transition employee to get 
clarification.  If you need samples of any of these reports please let my 
assistant, Pam Chambers, know and she will coordinate getting a sample report 
printed for you.  

In addition, I will need a list of the users and their logonid's who will 
need to have access to this data.  Please send that to me by the 15th as 
well.

Clay,
     I have had several requests from the ENA business groups. now that the
agreement has been finalized, for report lists from your key applications, 
those
being, Altra GMS and Risk Works( there may be others as people become more
aware). There will be a need for information for ENA to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period. We feel this would be an easier process to 
work
through if ENA knows what kind of information they can request as we go 
through
the transition.

Thanks, Richard

employees to give us a list of what they know we would probably need to deal 
with historical questions on pipeline and customer physical imbalances as 
well as any other information that helps support some of the large customer 
and asset transactions. 

Have each of them put together a list that we can consolidate and forward to

The following summarizes the decisions made during our  user & IT joint 
meeting today regarding the handling of CES historical data.

A.  Bryce Baxter will coordinate with all user groups to identify CES reports 
that need to be actually printed as hard copy or transfered to files that 
will be accessed               via the Electronic Document Management system.
B.  Jeff Peoples will be working with Bryce Baxter to produce reports using 
CES system via ISDN line at Enron building - this will continue to be part of 
his duty until  the job is done (Jeff joined ENA as a member of Sitara group).
C.  Larry Daze will be working with Jeff Peoples and Bryce Baxter to ensure 
all reports are loaded on our EDMS with proper indexing.
D.  No need for manupulating CES history data is necessary  (i.e. downloading 
on spreadsheets).  Therefore, no data will be kept on the disk other than 
EDMS.

Pat, 

You should have been included on this.  I probably won't go to these meetings 
since I won't be dealing with Unify much in the future.  I don't mind going

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL 
Meter #986884. 
 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

One more update to change references to Susie LLinas to DBA on call.

Charlotte, 

This is a desk-to-desk deal.  You need to get with the scheduler on the East 
Desk who handles Transco.  Both desks will need to tie in MOPS.  In this 
case, POPS most  likely tried to update the HPL side, but the East Desk has 
not adjusted their side in MOPS.

D

   
	
	

Daren:

I have an error for Transco Bammel for that 20.0/day on days 23 through 27 - 
do you change the volumes as they are sent back?  

The volumes are:

23     133
24     20783
25     20738
26     20787
27     20123

Thanks!

Charlotte

PS    I have to be clear by noon tomorrow.........................

     

Carlos, 

Please look into your Black Marlin info and see if you can find anything on 
this.  Thanks.

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

Details for the deal to be entered on Jan. 1, 2000:

Buy/Sell:  Buy
Ctpty: Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation
Zone:  Agua Dulce @ 0584
Volume:  5,000/d
Pricing:  HSC -0.065
Period:  1/8/00-1/31/00

This deal will be the second part of Sitara deal #143974.

Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

In case you were not aware, you have the ability to control the Date display 
format on your PC.  As we approach year 2000, you may wish to see all four 
digits of the year to insure that when you enter '00', the system recognizes 
it as 2000 vs. 1900.  Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to 
view these 2 additional digits.  To do this, go to:

Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style.  
You may want to change it from "mm/dd/yy" to "mm/dd/yyyy" then hit OK.

The screen print below may be helpful.  Please forward to others in your area 
that may be interested.  Thanks, d.n.

I have several months that need to have the demand charges either added or 
adjusted.  When Katherine gave you the numbers the first time, there were 
some spot deals included in the exchange deals.  The volumes have now been 
moved to the correct deals and the demand charges need to be corrected.  I 
have listed the changes below.  Let me know if you would like to see the 
spreadsheets.

Deal 157278
3/00 Add demand charge of $73,403.47 for excess charge
4/00 Change demand fee from $1,507.56 to $1,966.93
6/00 Change demand fee from $1,129.99 to $359.97

Deal 157288
3/00 Change demand fee from $3,526.98 to $245.82

pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla &  
Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was 
complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have 
reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that 
this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before

contract shows 089-41500-102 representing a sale in the amount of 9448.

I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into 
Jan 2000.

Cokinos / 9676  95912 - No this is a GTC Firm contract, deal expires with 
contract
Cokinos / 6373  128952 - This is a GTC Spot
Coral / 4120  93883 - This is on a Single Transaction contract, we would need 
to check with the trader
Encina / 6392  93487 - Yes, this is a committed reserve.  I marked the 
evergreen flag.
Midcoast / 5097  92956 - No, GTC 1st Purchaser, deal expires with contract.
United O&M / 5053 93728 - No, this deal was moved to the Wellhead portfolio 
for January, but the deal was terminated per legal.
Vintage / 2540  93750 - Not the right deal number.

It will be fine to use current +1 as the cutoff.

D

   

FYI - what do you all think?
Just to clarify, its not the relative age of the production date, but the age 
of the event itself.

d.n.

Do any of you see a problem with limiting this to the current month or 
current month +1
Need to know soon

Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

Here are the issues for HL&P for 11/99:

The shortage at San Jac meter 1554 (the 95%) cannot be made up at 7268 
because not enough flow at the meters.  What can we do?  Buyback?
Adonis has nom of 10000mmbtu on day 4, should this be kept whole?   If so, 
how?  Day 4 flowed of 153mmbtu at the aggregate meter.

Please advice.  

Thanks

Susan, 

I need you to do the research on this meter.  You will need to review the 
various scheduling systems to see how this was handled prior to 2/96.  You 
can also check with Volume Management to see if they have any info regarding 
the allocation of the point.  Let me know what you find out and I will work 
on getting a deal in place.

Daren,

I have flow at this meter for the first, 118 Dth.  There is an expired 
purchase from Highland at the meter, but, this deal ended August 31st.  HPL 
had a deal with Highland in October to purchase these volumes (deal ticket 
418382).  I think that the deal needs to be extended, it looks like the valve 
was not completely shut by 9 am.  Pat has asked that this issue be resolved 
today, so, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Mary

The 4429 is good.

Michael Olsen@ENRON

This was a weekend deal with Mirant.  On your spreadsheet, the volume shows 
4429.  This is also the volume that I confirmed with Mirant.  The deal is in 
Unify for 5429.  Could you please check and let me know which volume is good. 

Mike

Bob, 

I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet.  Look over these and call me 
if you have questions.  A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers, so I 
moved them down in the sheet.  I would like for you to make the changes 
tomorrow after trading.

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies 
closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) 
we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so 
that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really 
affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on 
May 6th next month.

Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049

Thanks
GG

Julie, 

You need to keep the nom and confirm at 3000 so that the buyback calculation 
will work correctly.

Did you want me to confirm down on this meter  starting today.  (POPs).

Pls let me know ,so that I can redraft the sale through Unify.

Unable to draft volume in Unify due to the expired deal ticket;

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related 
to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going 
a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the 
majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading 
arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda 
rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the 
week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay 
balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split 
into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, 
with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  
It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things 
to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The 
kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to 
turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was 
too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides 
down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow 
bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off 
or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the 
way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets 
right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe 
you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next 
couple of days.

D

Did you survive bid week?
?
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for 
you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff 
left?
?
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
?
Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a ?personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big ?changes. It sucks.???Later,?Ken??????

You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at 
mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All 
other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)

D

Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 
3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that 
change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to 
path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie

The deal with Oxy Vinyls (#276478) will covers the volume for all of

A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day.  
We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas 
was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if 
Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though 
their deal went to zero.  Please advise.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I 
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand 
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand 
fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to 
the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

I am not going with AEP.  So please don't include me in your estimates.

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record 
of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The 
price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you 
don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February 
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a 
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his 
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not 
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Bob says he was not billed for a purchase he made from you at 5K  $5.16 on 
Feb 21st.  Will you check this out and get with
Bob A and Katherine Herrera.

On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to Duke Energy Field Services at Waha.  However, I 
entered the deal (#603484) under Duke Energy Marketing (Can you believe I 
made a mistake?).  To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under 
DEFS.  

Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done.

Sorry for the extra work.

D

No problem.

Daren,

I tried to get KCS to give me the nom earlier but it is just now coming in.  
The nom on Vance's spreadsheet was 7,129.  KCS is reducing the gathering 
piece to 5,500.

Bob
Bob Withers <rww@KCSEnergy.com> on 03/28/2001 11:16:01 AM
This is the estimated Josey Ranch nomination for the month of April 2001.
The HPL nomination volume to be effective 4/1/2001 is:

      5,500 MMBtu/day for KCS Resources
     1,500 MMBtu/day for TEXACO
     7,000 MMBtu/day Total (assumed Btu factor of 1.083
@ 14.65 dry)

If you need additional information, KCS' field contact is Stretch Brennan in
Victoria: 512 / 576 - 1005.

We are finally closing another month.  Please change the demand fee on deal 
157278 for July 2000 from $33,239.39 to $22,159.22.

Thanks,
Megan

Gary, 

Do you have any record of this?

D
Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but 
I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not 
there was a deal for that day?  Thanks.

Aimee

Rebecca Griffin@ENRON
03/20/2001 01:18 PM
Aimee,

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They 
are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything 
for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Patrick, 

The attached file contains the base and spot purchases by zone on HPL  for 
September 2000.  Let me know if you have any questions.

D

Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

D

   

Daren,

Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all 
new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  
Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:

Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period  Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC 9876   85mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.17  3/13 - 3/31 
96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

Thanks,

I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers 
you listed are WRONG.  

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to 
POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).
Deal 529738 is valid for mtr 1598.  It has a zero nom, also.

1.  Meter 0416  flowed the whole month  1-28.  This our ols friends at Pawnee 
gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it.
2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last 
deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 
3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- 
Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620

I'll get Accounting Arrangements for these when you let me know the deal

Please take care of this in POPS.  It looks like we've already hit the 50,000 
mark on #572910.

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets 
correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on 
this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

THANKS

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on 
the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a 
price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my 
understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the 
delivery period

.  If you need any additional information or have any questions, please 
contact me at 35656.  Thanks.  EMV

Megan, 

I changed the demand fee for Jan.  It looks like Trisha has changed the 
Transport ticket for the $.11.  I agree with the header charges.

D

   

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and 
$0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please 
change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They 
have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El 
Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has 
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called 
"Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is 
$0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

Thu, 

I talked with Lee Papyoti about the Equistar buybacks.  I created deal 675086 
as an ENA buyback.  However, after you have allocated the volume between the 
Equistar plants, please get with Lee and have him look over everything.

D

   
	
	

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals 
240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I 
have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough gas 
at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can 
achieve this.  

Thu
Daren's response.

Daren J Farmer
03/14/2001 12:30 PM
We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at 
mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any 
days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any 
shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

D

Aimee Lannou   03/14/2001 11:03 AM

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her 
I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like 
it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA 
deal whole.  What do you suggest? 

AL 
Aimee,

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep 
the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there 
last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there 
is another way.

We do not have storage in a facility on PG&E.  But, we do use parking and 
lending agreements regularly.

D

   

We don't have storage on PG&E do we?  I think that is park and lend.  What do 
you think?  I have put together the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel.

Dave

	
	

Please provide the information requested below as soon as possible.  
Improvement in this process will help minimize flash-to-actual variances. 

Has any progress been made on this?  So far, I have only received information 
on Cove Point.

We show that there is physical storage on the following pipelines:

CENTRAL -  Mid Continent, Moss Bluff, NGPL, and Reliant.
TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, 
Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, 
Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of 
physical storage between flash and the GL.  To that end, please provide the 
book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the 
physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 
inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide 
the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.

Done.

   

Please change the demand fee on deal 157288 for 8/00 from $9,575.45 to 
$6,143.64.  We need to reduce our payment to Duke.  When I adjusted the over 
delivery charge on the days we didn't nom,  the demand amount changed.  I 
waited until Duke agreed before I sent you this change.  

Thanks,
Megan

The $.10 rate should be correct.

That's great.  What about deal 452475?  We have $0.10 and we are being billed 
$0.11 for meter 25000200 on contract 1856.  Also, I faxed the Oct 2000 TXU 
invoices to Trisha Hughes so she can look into the Dec 2000 and forward

Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,

Eric, 

I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).  He is looking to 
market LNG in Europe.  Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I 
didn't get much specific information.  But, I told him I would find someone 
for him to talk with.  His name is Sam Kovacevich.  Phone:  847-971-3369.  I 
would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.  If you aren't the person 
he needs to talk to, please let me know.  Thanks.

Megan, 

I have changed the pricing on deals 452491 and 452475 for October flows to 
mtr 25000200.  These flows should be priced at $.10 + 1/2 % fuel.  The $.11 
that Lone Star billed us is incorrect on the last deal.  I'm not sure about 
the rates for mtr 20014903.  The person who can tell us should be in 
tomorrow.  I will leave a note for her.  We should have similar deal tickets 
for Dec forward.  I will check with Mark and Trisha.

Rita, 

I think that we have the pricing worked out now with the suppiers.  There 
were some ammendments to the contract, reducing the demand charges, that we 
did not have.  I don't have any contacts at Lone Star related to 
allocations.  Mark's scheduling contacts may help.  Stacey has a trading 
contact with the pipeline.  When she returns tomorrow, I will have her give 
you a call.  The beginning imbalance on Lone Star was around 180,000 owed to 
Lone Star when we took on the management services in October.  Mark should be 
able to get you an exact number if you need it.

Daren,

We are working with Mark McCoy on getting some things repathed in the 
system.  It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify 
just the deliveries -not sure why????.  We have been paying the suppliers 
based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller 
number than what we have in Unify.  Also, we have not been able to get a 
contact for the allocation statement.  In some cases, we get the summary 
sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.  Do you 
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on 
a timely and consistent basis?  The contacts on the allocation statements 
that we do have are not returning phone calls.  I also need to know what was 
the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that 
we need from you, I will call you.

Thanks,
RW

We do not have a demand fee for the Feb 2001 Tenaska IV sale, deal 384258.  
Can you please put this in so I can bill?  From your spreadsheet, it looks 
like it needs to be $2,291,888.83, but you can verify.  I subtracted the 
agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number, since we already have that 
booked.

The deals you listed are transpurt usage tickets that we use to estimate the

contracts (We will pay Lone Star and Tenaska will reimburse us.)

Hello friends,

Leslie and I have a sleeper sofa, a real sturdy and heavy one, that we are
wanting to get rid of.  It has a very comfortable bed and would be great
for
an extra room in the house.  It is in great condition other than some cat
claws in the arms...done before I cut out the claws.

I have pictures I can e mail if you are interested.  We will give it away
or
sell it to the highest bidder!

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton.

What are the details on the tv?

How old? Problems? Condition? etc.

Daren

Guys, 
Just thought you might find this interesting.? I was forwarded this 
poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az. 
Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly 
amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB 

Now I sit me down in school 
Where praying is against the rule 
For this great nation under God 
Finds mention of Him very odd. 

If Scripture now the class recites, 
It violates the Bill of Rights. 
And anytime my head I bow 
Becomes a Federal matter now. 

Our hair can be purple, orange or green, 
That's no offense, it's a freedom scene. 
The law is specific, the law is precise. 
Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice. 

For praying in a public hall 
Might offend someone with no faith at all. 
In silence alone we must meditate, 
God's name is prohibited by the state. 

We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks, 
And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. 
They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible. 
To quote the Good Book makes me liable. 

We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen, 
And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King. 
It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong, 
We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong. 

We can get our condoms and birth controls, 
Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. 
But the Ten Commandments are not allowed, 
No word of God must reach this crowd. 

It's scary here I must confess, 
When chaos reigns the school's a mess. 
So, Lord, this silent plea I make, 
Should I be shot; My soul please take!

Mike, 

I don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery.  So, why 
don't you check with Gas Control to see if they know why vol was delivered on 
that day.  I would think that they had to send someone out there to make it 
happen.  Additionally, you can check with Gary Lamphier or Lee Papyoti to see 
if they made a deal with the plant.

Hey Ken.

How are things going for you?  Is the market loving you?

We have been really busy.  We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.  I 
don't think I had it underpriced.  I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales 
in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the 
average.  Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were 
happy.  Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in 
Oaks of Devonshire.  It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.  
It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a 
great game room/sunroom for the kids.  It was built in 86, so it needs a 
little work.  But that's ok with me.  Anyway, we are closing on both houses 
on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.  We will have you and Linda over 
for lunch or dinner one of these days.  We also had tubes put into Jake's 
ears this month.  We hated having to do that, but it has really made a 
difference.  He had a constant ear infection since October.  Now you can tell 
that he feels so much better.  He's learning more and more each day.  We have 
nothing that is "Jake proof".  Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets 
don't hold him.  He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over 
that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.  I'm going to install 
pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.  We'll see if that stops him.  
Anyway, everybody's doing well.  I will be alot better after we finish this 
house business.  I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.  
Talk to you later.

D

That's fine.

Daren do you have a problem if I copy the 2000 deal (362125) for Pioneer and 
make a new one for 2001.  They have flow in Jan. This is giving me a meter 
allocation exception forJan.  Let me know thanks. 

I have done deals with John at this point.  Why are we not being allocated 
any volume?

I am getting several phone calls from Alpine Resources demanding to be paid 
for meter 5892 and there is nothing there to be paid.  

The person name doing the requesting is John Childers and he said that he 
spoke to Daren Farmer.  He is looking for 859 mmbtu's for December, 2000 and 
3,251 mmbtu's for January 2001 .  This is on the Katy Gas Unit.  If anyone 
would like to talk to John his phone number is 281-646-0232

Daren,

Do you know if this deal was supposed to run through 12/00 and 1/01?  It was 
a deal to buy 400 per day from Harman Operating and is currently in for 
11/15/00 to 11/30/00.  Volume management said they are looking for their 
money.

Let me know.  

Thanks.

That's cool.

Mark McCoy@ENRON

FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for 
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I 
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no 
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at 
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up 
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

Thanks,
Mark

I changed the demand to a negative value.  I don't know if this will work or 
not.  If it does not work, I can put the demand on the sale ticket.

D

   

Can you make it negative?  We need to reduce our payment.

Daren J Farmer@ECT
02/15/2001 01:40 PM
Done.

   

I finally heard back from Duke regarding Sept 2000.  They agree with our 
spreadsheet, so I need a demand fee to adjust the price in Sitara.

Deal 157288 - demand fee of ($8,745.69)

Thanks,
Megan

Done.

Daren,

Do you know if there should be a deal in place for Midcoast on this meter for 
January?  Currently, it only shows ENA.  I understand that a deal was added 
in December for Midcoast, but that deal was only good for Dec.

Thanks.

Mike

Attached is a revised allocation file for October.  Please note that the 
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list.  
Also, "Global Markets" and "Industrial Markets" have been broken out for 
billing purposes.  If you have cost centers that are allocating to either of 
these teams, please provide a breakdown of those percentages by Monday, 
November 6th.

All other allocations are due by end of day today.

I have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until 
the end of 2001. 

Thank you for your help.  Please call if you have any additional questions. 

Holly

Done.

We have the actuals for December 2000.  We need three demand fees.  Let me 
know if you have any questions. 
 Deal 529856 - $878,330.63 to offset price difference on Tenaska IV sale
 Deal 384258 - $459,483.51 to bill Tenaska IV for payable reimbursement
 Deal 514353 - change demand volume from 45,000 to 45,333 to update agency fee

Also, I need one more adjustment to Nov 2000 and then we will be done.  

 Deal 529856, day 11/01 - change demand fee from $409,145.72 to $407,547.02

Thanks,
Megan

I have created a spreadsheet to assist in the tracking and booking of the gas 
supply related to Tenaska IV.  If you have suggestions or comments on the 
file, contact either me or Mark.

Megan - You can copy the Jan 01 Est tab and update the volumes with actuals.  
The file should calculate the resulting settlement with Tenaska.  I will then 
update the demand fee on the deal ticket to true-up the month.  Since we 
haven't gone through actuals in the spreadsheet, we may have to do some 
tweaking with the formulas.  Anyway, this should give us a good start and you 
will be able to see where we closed the month in Logisitics.

The file is located in O/Logistics/Cleburne Plant/2001FuelMgmt.xls.  If you 
don't have access, we can look into creating a new location on the O drive.  
The spreadsheet is attached for this month.  This is definitely a work in 
progress.  So, if you have ideas to make it easier, or if you need something 
added, let us know.

I would like to receive the alerts.

For Dec. and Jan. production there are flow volumes without a deal.  Deal 
502952 was good for November.  Do you want to extend this deal or should 
there be another counterparty added?

Thanks.

Heather, 

I will be leaving today at 1:00.  We are buying a house and we have the 
inspection today.  So, if Bob ar anyone needs me they can contact me by pager

I have created deal #604061 to cover the buyback for 12/27/00.

D

Can either of you verify this?
Paul Couvillon@ENRON
01/31/2001 02:45 PM
	

Gary:

For Company 12 could you please put in a buy-back for Reliant Energy HL&P on 
Contract # 96022113 for the volume of 1,286 Mmbtu's on 12/27/2000.  The 
pipeline and point are HPL/UTTC-HARDY STREET MIDCON (BI-DIRECTIONAL) and the 
scheduler is Mary Poorman @ X-35251.  

The pricing should be as follows;
The lower of KATY MID day of flow or day after.

The pricing of KATY MID for 10/27 was $ 10.26
                10/28 was $ 9.63.

The sale counter-part to this purchase should go to deal # 529159.

To forecast Entex:

We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low 
and high temps for each day.  When we get a weather report for the new day, 
we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.  The database 
is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides 
an average volume for that criteria.  (For example:  With temps of 40-60, the 
sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 
to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.  An average is 
then calculated from that volumetric data.  In this case, the average is 
calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)  Upon calculating the average, we then apply 
information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.  
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;  
Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex 
takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating 
volumes each day), etc.

Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to 
estimate the remaining 70%.  If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days 
that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been 
caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates 
more in line.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren

Liz,  

Please look into this.

Rebecca Griffin@ENRON
11/01/2000 02:44 PM
Could you add meter PGE-LS 491-754 to TXU Fuel deal #108672 for May 12, 2000 
in Sitara?  TXU received 2,000 mmbtu on that day as part of the Gas Daily 
contract, however, the volume is pathed under the Wagner Brown contract due 
to the meter.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca

I created deal 602030 under Cleco.

D

Mary Poorman@ENRON
02/01/2001 07:20 AM
I don't know if they paid Torch, I would assume so, as this is October.  
According to Charlene, Cleco is invoicing us for this deal.  Intially, there 
was no deal in the system at all.  

We will need to wait until Janet gets back.  This is a spot deal that was 
done by Gary Lamphier.  Did Janet negotiate something with them after the 
fact?

we have a purchase booked here, we need to reverse?
Jack Simunek
01/31/2001 10:19 AM
Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  PG&E did not fully process the 
gas stream at their Indian Springs plant on December 12 and 13 and took the 
reduced shrinkage, 19.000 MMBtu/d, and sold it to HPL at Gas Daily -$0.04.  
PG&E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that 
volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month 
index.  At the same time PG&E will create an imbalance, for which they will 
pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.  This 
should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the 
beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract) 
and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.  The paperwork is 
on its way to me to close this issue out.

   
	
	

Jack,
Sandra at TECO seems to think you may have some information on how this deal 
should work.   

Mary Poorman@ENRON
01/22/2001 04:47 PM
Ed,

Sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal I have attached below.  
Apparently we bot from PGE Industrial on the 12th and 13th.  PG&E has 
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to TECO, and claim that they are 
net deals.  I do not show a sale in the system at the meter, and I checked 
the 215 K for those days for a corresponding delivery to TECO, perhaps at 
another meter, and could not find one.  

Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated.

Mary 

Paul,

Grab me when you get a minute.  I have your bonus and merit info.  You're 
going to like it.

D

Bob, 

I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.  
The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been 
left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas 
Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:

1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas 
business.
2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.   
3)  Develop a replacement
 a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )
 b.  Hire new person, internally or externally
4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we 
will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.

1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail 
will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of 
activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.  
I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and 
possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need 
to do.

D

Bob M Hall@ENRON
01/29/2001 04:19 PM
Heather will be calling each of up to set up a time to discuss your review 
for 2000.

Please bring with you two items that you plan on working on during the first 
six months of 2001.

These should be items that improve the process around your area or brings 
additional
income to Enron.

thanks

I don't think that we should have any volume on this deal.  It seems like Jan 
2000 was added after the fact to assist with allocations.  But it was later 
determined that we didn't purchase anything from Copano.

D

Daren,

I'm looking into this deal.   There is no volume on this deal for January 
00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Please let me know if you intended to have volume on this deal for Jan 00  

THANKS

Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

should be meter 1373.  The 10.000 is split between two meters, but all should 
be at meter 1373.  Can I change it?  

AL

Daren - here are the Equistar #'s.  There should be a total of 65.000.  There 
is  a new deal per Janice at Equistar at meter 1373 effective 2/01.  I have 
not seen a deal for this.  Let me know if it is legitimate.  No volumes were 
added, just moved from meter to meter.  (Deal # 378904)  Thanks.

Daren,

I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

vlt

Daren J Farmer
01/25/2001 01:47 PM
I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think the 
gas will flow for the month and at what price.  I will use your decision for 
our bidweek postion.

How would you want to handle for February nomination?

vlt
x3-6353

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

The above deal number expired at the end of November 2000 and needs to either 
be extended through December, or a new deal inputted.  Can you assist me in 
this?

Thanks.

Mike

Lee, 

I would like to deliver as much of Midcon's gas as possible to Mobil 
(25,000-30,000) for February.  When the work is going on, we can move that 
around.  Also, we have 10,000 baseload on Centana we need to deliver to the 
plant.

D

Mobil says the low point of their takes will be during February will be from 
Feb 1 to 14.  So any day in that time period would be a good time for HPL to 
do the required maintenance at the Texoma-Beaumont system interconnect.

We need to define our game plan: 
- what day to do the work
- how much gas HPL will deliver through our own meter
- how we use Centana to deliver the rest of the HPL volumes
- if we had planned in Feb to baseload some of our MidCon obligation at Mobil 
as we have done in Dec and Jan, then we will need to do something different 
whenever we do the maintenance

James - we are scheduled to meet with Mobil in Beaumont at 10.30am Thursday 
Feb 1, to go over the game plan with them.

Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend?

Thanks

Lee

Deal has been extended.

d

Aimee Lannou   01/22/2001 04:58 PM

Daren - there is flow on meter 1386 for 1/4/01.  Deal 150325 expired on day 
3.  Could you please extend this deal or create a new one?  Thanks.

AL

Done.

D

   

Please adjust the following demand fees for Tenaska for 11/00 and 10/00.

Deal 529856, day 11/01 - change from 493,365.75 to 409,145.72
Deal 529856, day 10/01 - change from 2,405,706.50 to 2,349,906.50
Deal 529856, day 10/02 - change from 184,138.99 to 128,338.99

Deal 514353 - change demand volume from 45,016 to 44,350

Thanks,
Megan

Jackie, 

I didn't pay any attention to the date on this message.  We should be able to 
handle this on our side with out involving the East Desk.  If the OBA can be 
used, apply the volume there.  If nothing else, we can write it off.

D

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.

Sandi, 

Do you have a complete contract for the Apache purchase under the Tenaska IV 
deal?  Apache is billing us a rate that is $.11 below the commodity rate 
stated on page 22 in the original contract.  In the documents I have, I can't 
find a reason for the adjustment.  I may be missing an amendment or 
something.  I thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could 
help me out.

Daren

Hey, Mom.

I got your e-mail just fine.  Is your computer fixed up now?  

Cole had a great time at his birthday party last night.  When we were walking 
out of Chuck E Cheese after the party, Cole asked me "Daddy, am I three 
now?"  He got some good presents and got to play alot of games.  It took him 
forever to go to sleep.  He really loved the Blues Clues game ya'll got him.  
The packaging was coming open when he got it yesterday, so Tonya let him open 
it before the party.  He played it in the car going to the party and on the 
way home.  I think I'm tired of that game.  He can't play it in the car 
anymore.  It so funny to watch him play though.  He will repeat the question 
and go "hmm".  Anyway I need to go.

D

Hey! Just checking out the new machine.  I sent Cole's birthday present 
today.  Hope he gets it on time.  Let me know if you get this message please. 

Megan, 

I can meet with you on the Pan Energy Swap anytime Thursday or Friday 
afternoon.  Early afternoon usually works best for me.  I can come up to your 
desk if that is easier.  Let me know.

D

I have adjusted the pricing for the Apache and Williams deals for September 
forward as we disucussed in the meeting today. 

D

BH, 

If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend, I would help you out.  
However, we have a pretty important family weekend coming up.  Cole's 3rd 
birthday is today.  We will be doing a little celebrating with that.  Plus, 
we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling 
appointments to view other houses.  Anyway, I hope everything else is going 
well for you.  We need to talk sometime.  I will call you in a couple of days.

D

   

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.

I will not be able to play golf or party.  I was really wanting to go, but 
can't make it.

D

Talked to Gary this morning...

We need a head count...

We are planning to have a golf outing the day of the party...so I need to
know if you are going to play golf, play golf and party or just party....

Please respond as soon as possible so we can make sure Gary has the time of
his life!!

thanks,

Jeff

Hey, Ken.

Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.  We will have a Texas Desk, but I 
don't really want to continue here.  I may look into Brenda's group (Pulp, 
Paper, Lumber, Steel).  I will most likely interview with AEP to see what 
they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the 
Evil Empire.  I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.  Some folks are 
upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.

Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.  Cole 
loved everything.  He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to 
an end.  Jake is a little different.  We spent $60 on a couple of things for 
him.  He hasn't touched them more than twice.  He found his new favorite toy 
the day after Christmas:  it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your 
lunch in.  He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it 
around everywhere.  Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up 
more room in our already crowded house.

We started our house hunting last week.  I think this is going to be a long 
process.  Tonya's out looking today.  I'm letting her make the first cut.  I 
will come in on the second round.  We will probably put our house on the 
market in a couple of weeks.  We have a few small things we want to clean up, 
fix, etc., before we list it.  According to the other sales in the 
neighborhood, we should make a little money.

I hope everything is going well with you and the family.  

Later.

D

Sorry about this, Victor.  I didn't even pay attention to the date.  I was 
thinking this was October business.  We will definitely be able to do 
somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.

beginning that month.  I may be able to help reconcile some of this.

How are we looking on the rest of our estimates thru King Ranch?  do we need 
to adjust Big Cowboy or 3 Rivers?

D

Mary Poorman@ENRON
01/10/2001 11:53 AM
FYI - 

We are having some "after-the-fact" balancing issues with King Ranch.  I just 
spoke with Carol regarding our net position with the plant, she has informed 
me that the Saxet Canales production we are buying at the inlet has been 
averaging approximately 3,850 Dth/day for January, and has been producing at 
or around that level since November.  We don't have eyes at the meter, 
however, Carol was brought online this past week, and I will be receiving 
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries.

We have been scheduling 838 to 1,045 Dth/day at the meter.  We need to gross 
up for Jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do 
not create additional balancing issues with the plant.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, or need additional 
information.

Mary

I have rolled deal 506192 thru 1/1/01, priced at Dec HSC Index -.045.

Aimee Lannou   01/10/2001 09:23 AM

Daren - After checking with MIPS, you are correct.  Jan. 1 only flowed 19 
dth.  The 5882 dth was a bad estimate.  A better estimate was received on 
1/7/00.
Sorry about all the confusion.

AL

Gary - We did not deliver gas to Phillips on Dec. 1.  Also, I am not sure if 
the plant was down, but we did not deliver to them on Dec. 2-4.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know.

Aimee

   

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less 
(.045).  Which is bad!  Let me know what happened in Dec before I can put 
this deal out in Jan.

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

Daren - there is flow at meter 1386 for Jan 1-3.  The average flow is 
828/day.  The last deal associated with this meter is 150325, Dec. 1-4, 
2000.  The counterparty is Hampshire.  Could you please look at this and let 
me know if you put a deal in for these days?

Thanks.

I have created deal 559843 to cover the flow for Nov 1 thru Jan 31.  This 
deal will probably be handled month-to-month from here on out.

Aimee Lannou   01/05/2001 10:37 AM

Daren - There was flow at meter 1351 for Dec 2000.  It flowed every day, with 
an average flow of 151/day.  The last deal associated with this meter was 
274772 in October '00.  It also flowed in November with no nom, it is 
currently on stranger's gas.  Can you please take a look at this?  Thanks.

Gary Lamphier is working on negotiating a price for this.

Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day 
1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal # 
506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.

AL

Deal 135714 is active through Oct 2000.  The volume on the ticket is zero, so 
the nom was probably never sent to POPS.

Deal #135714 was at this meter, but the contract tied to this deal expired at 
the end of August 2000.   Currently, these volumes are being booked to the 
HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics need either (1) Purchase Contract

Done.

All of the outside sales for 11/00 have been paid.  We now need to forward 
the cash to Tenaska IV.  The demand charge for deal 529856 should be 
$341,250.47.  I have attached my spreadsheet.  The number is based on noms, 
so when we receive the actuals I will send you a revised number.

Megan

Megan, 

I adjusted deal 529856 on the 2nd of Oct and Nov for the adjustments below.  
Can you make this work?

D

   

Are you going to make the price changes to the Tenaska IV sale 384258 for 
10/00 and 11/00 that James details below?  Right now, we are showing a short 
pay of $351,201.49 for those two months.

Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before 
reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts 
that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

James

Any sales made to MGI off of HGPL or HPL should be billed by the Texas Desk.  
However, HPL will not invoice MGI.  All trades are done under ENA.

I was informed to bill anything on HGPL by my supervisor, but when I talk to 
Priscilla Hamic she informed me that HGPL should be billed by offsystem and 
not the Texas desk.  The deals in Sitara that relate to HGPL all state that 
it is Texas desk.

Please let me know who should be billing MGI Supply for HGPL volume.

The Global Octanes plant crashed last night.  The undertakes (volume below

notified by either Lee Papyoti or myself.  Thanks.

Jackie, Talk to Darren about this. The deal you reference is an HPL deal with 
Dynegy and I don't have access to it. I'm on the East desk. Yesterday I 
extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need

and by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the

advise when you've extended the deal so that Sherlyn can create an accounting

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Jackie Young
12/15/2000 10:51 AM
Arre you saying that for both days that two (2) ENA contracts should be 
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the 
total volume to each contract?

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Daren,

 I want to thank you angain for your heart-felt generosit y.  The JDF walk is 
this weekend, and we are supposed to turn in our money by wednesday for Enron 
to match these amounts.  It is to this end that I request you make your check 
payable to "JDF" for the $25 pledged as soon as possible, and call me to let 
me know when I can stop by and pick it up. 

Thanks again!

This volume should be allocated to deal 138642 for Jan.  The meter has always 
been on the ticket, but with zero volume.

During the period of 1/1/2000 to 1/4/2000, the above meter has recorded flow 
on the following days with no deals attached:

 Days     Mmbtus

 1/1/00          3,737
 1/2/00          3,713
 1/3/00          3,730
 1/4/00             800
      
        11,980

Deal #120891 was at that meter during 12/99 production month, but it expired 
on 12/31/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1)  have Deal #120891 
extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to writeoff these volumes to 
Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to Clem 
Cernosek).

Thanks, Clem

FYI.

I have added deal # 541123 as a buyback for December 25-31 2000.
Please invoice South Hampton total flow thru the meter 12/01 - 12/24; on 
12/25 they should be invoiced a minimum of 1700 mmbtu per day at contract and 
buy back
900 mmbtu per day per sitara 541123.  Please call with questions.

Daren please forward to client services.

We should probably take this deal to zero.

Carlos - Please check with measurement to determine if this volume is 
correct.  We may have some bad information feeding through.

We billed Wyman Gordon 363 mmbtus at $4.7328 in Sept 2000.

 I spoke with Richard Moran at Wyman Gordon and he indicated that he has not 
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the 
$1,718.01 we billed him for September.

Can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have 
been linked to some type of financial deal.  

Thanks- Katherine

This gas should be allocated to deal 70499 (Unit Gas Transmission).  That 
point is already on the ticket (under ENA).

During the period of 9/5/99 thru 9/6/99, the above meter recorded flow of 
3,962 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

Aimee, 

I have updated deal 15765 in Sitara for this change effective today.

D
got a call last night from Carbide - they rescinded the change from 14,000/d 
rate to 6,000/d rate for safety net gas that was due 9am this morning. 

So here's where we should be now with Carbide:

Seadrift - no saftey net, just the 10,000/d baseload deal

Texas City - 10,000/d of the term deal, plus 14,000/d of safety net, total 
24,000/d

Please add me to your First Delivery distribution.  Thanks.

What is the process to approve this in the system?

Hey, Ken.

Well, the folks are fine.  But, they have a few friends who lost just about 
everthing.  In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) 
items from their home (only one family picture) .  I understand that alot of 
homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.  It was very 
bad.  What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.  When we talked 
to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was.

 Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?  I took friday and Monday off 
and tried my luck at it.  I didn't last too long.  It doesn't seem right to 
be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think 
I'm becoming a scrooge.   Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in 
the Christmas mood.  Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels 
and monster trucks).  Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on 
except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.  We've 
told him "no" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while 
he's grabbing for one.  He is a handful.  Jake has also started taking 
steps.  He just turned 9 months old this month.  That's a little over a month 
earlier than Cole started taking steps.  

Anyway, I need to go.

D

Hi, 
Are the folks in Tuscaloosa OK? Sounds really bad over  there.
?
Ken

I can meet on Friday from 12:00-2:00 or Wednesday anytime after 1:00pm.  
Wednesday would be the best for me since we will be into bidweek on Friday.

I have measurement actuals for the first 14 days at this meter with no deal 
in the system.  This is wellhead production.  Please advise.

Mary

With PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can 
adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.  I am not able to follow your ua4 
calculation.  However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout 
September and October.  (This should have been pathed to the Lone Star 
transport k in Unify).  Is this in that ua4 number?  Williams had been trying 
to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume 
came in greater than booked.  (Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes 
vary each day from scheduled.)  The volumes that they were trying to make up 
would go toward the transport imbalance also.  I would think that Cleburne 
will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.  After Novemeber, 
the imbalance should be fairly small.  Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have 
that number.  (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was 
very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the 
imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices 
if the opportunity came up.)

The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.  But, I will 
discuss that with Legal.  The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and 
fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.

I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.  We can get 
together then if you would like.

D

   
	
	

Darren, 
The demand fee is probably the best solution.  We can use it to create a 
recieivable/payable with Tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes 
each month.  How are PMA's to be handled once the fee been calculated and the 
deal put in the system?

Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the GL for Cleburne as of 
today.  Some of this info will change by the end of the month.  As you can 
see, there are some discrepancies between Megan's calculations and what is on 
the general ledger.  UA4 is also on my schedule.  Unless the buys/sells are 
volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk.  This will 
change the calculation of what is due from/to Tenaska.  Should we be 
recording a UA4 entry for Cleburne?  Is it addressed in the agreement with 
Tenaska?

  

Daren J Farmer@ECT
12/12/2000 04:48 PM
In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

D

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Megan

Tonya and I will be there.

   Good Morning!  

   I was wondering if you all would be interested in going in together to buy 
a 
   gift for Bob Hall.   I have picked out a little something that I thought 
he would 
   like for home or office.  Take a look and tell me what you think, asap.  

   This is completely optional, I thought it might help some of you (like me) 
who 
   have no idea what to get him.  If we all went in on it, it would cost us 
$17.00 each.

   

Description below for the  Audiovox Slimline CD Player & Radio

Slimline Radio w/ CD Player - with FREE shipping
Price: $119.00
 
This complete audio system can sit on a swivel base or be mounted on the wall 
as a convenient space saver. The ultra slim design features CD and cassette 
players 
as well as an AM/FM radio and remote control. 16?"L x 12 7/8"H x 6?"D.

Christy, I think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you, or your office.

I would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the N. Padre production.  I am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter.  Spinnaker expects a Division Order Title Opining within a few
weeks.  I also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final Opinion.  In talking with Ranger and The Houston
Exploration Company, they are prepared to receive their gross (shown below)
and be responsible to their respective ORRI owners.

How do you recommend we proceed?  Will HPL pay taxes on behalf of the
parties?

When you get a minute, please call me at 713/759-1770.

Thanks,

Dan McCue

Hey, Dwight.

Everything is going fine here.  Thanks for your message.  I'm feeling pretty 
confident with how things are going.  I have received very positive feedback 
from my manager and my employees.  I have learned much from you, especially 
related to communication:  recognizing the different types of people, 
different ways to communicate.  And, I appreciate the time you've spent with 
me.  However, I would like to discontinue our sessions for the time being.  
When I'm in need of some "managing expertise" in the future, I will give you 
a call.  

Again, thanks for working with me.

Thought y'all might find this amusing.
	
	

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-

What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and

there is
no problem with y'all,  can we will request the maintenance  between 12-3pm

The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system
'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need
to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to
perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected:

eqtprod
dcfprod
popprod
trdprod
semprod
sitprod2
infprd53

Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.

Robert will be coming too.  He said that he will be buying your lunch, since 
you wouldn't accept his x-mas present last year.

Just kidding.

We are on the 32nd floor now (Thru the glass door and turn right), if your 
badge still works.  Or, give me a call from the Lobby and I'll come get you.

Would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us (Carlos, Lauri, etc)?

Please join us in wishing Ami good luck in her new endeavors as she is moving 
to California ...  

DATE:   Thursday, Oct. 19th
TIME:     5:00 p.m.
WHERE:   Cafe Noche - The Patio (2409 Montrose Blvd.)

The reservations are under Ami's name.  Also, if the weather turns ugly, Cafe 
Noche will make other arrangements for us, so please come celebrate with us!

Lee, 

On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 
12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal 
with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, 
they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.

D

We have adjusted Suemar in Sitara.  And will probably adjust it again in a 
few days.  Since we bridge back estimates daily, the production at the 
Berryman well has been adjusted in the economics.  So, this will not have an 
impact on UA4.

Mary Poorman@ENRON

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are "overproduced" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

Why don't you come to the office around 11:00.  (I'll be trading Waha until 
10:30 or so.) You can come up and say "hi" to everyone.  Or, we can just meet 
in the lobby and walk over.

I have rolled the Hilcorp deal.  I will get Gary to look into the Williams

Another national crown ... It must be nice.  We have to keep referring back 
to our one and only in 1935.  But, we will never forget it!  I am looking 
forward to the 28th.  Tonya and I are going to the Aggie/K-state game.  We'll 
see how that goes.  Looks like your corn boys will be playing OU that 
weekend.  That should be a good battle.  OU also has a week off to get ready 
for you.  (I think they should be rated #2).

Things are going ok here.  I can't remember if we've talked about the sale of 
HPL.  That is getting closer to happening.  I am hoping it does.  I'm ready 
to go on to something else, and that would make it much easier.  Ami Chokshi 
decided that she would leave the co. this week.  She is heading of to San 
Fran.  No job or any specific plans yet, but it's always something whe has 
wanted to do.  It would be nice to be able to pick up and do something like 
that.

How's everything else going for you and the family.  We are all doing pretty 
good.  I actually took last week off.  The only plans I had were to spend 
time with the family.  It was great!  It really drove the point home that I 
need to stop letting people/things around here set my proiorities.

Anyway, would you be able to come down for lunch on Friday?  I'm sure it's 
been a while since you've had your Treebeard's.  Let me know.  Sorry I 
haven't talked to you much.  I'm going to end up losing all my friends if I 
don't change my ways.

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.  
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to 
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o 
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the 
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out 
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if 
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Consumer Price Index

Daren,
Thanks--while I'm certain I should know, I must confess that i do not know 
what CPI stands for???

Sandi

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

D

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi 

JM, 

The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is 
the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in

please?

Has this been resolved?

Liz or Stacey - There is flow at meter 74 on 9/14 (499 dth).  The deal for

I apologize for getting this to you so late.

I should have no staffing additions next year.

Staff 

Manager 1
Sr.  2 Average to High

Training

Both Seniors should attend 1 personal enrichment class (Effective 
Communication) and 1 Technical class.

I think that everything else should roll for next year. Let me know what else 
I need to give you.

SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems.  
Unfortunately, many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your 
staff's salary is.  I have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR 
department to also give me
the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most 
likely are not what
they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using 
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.

Here's what you can do:

1) Make a list of your staff just their positions.
2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to 
average, etc.
 You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that 
position, etc.
3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget.
4) Here is the average:

 Sr. $4,961
 Spec $3,964
 Staff $3,026
 Sr. Clrk $2,548
 Clerk $2,264
 Asst $3,162

Your list would look something like this:

 Assistant Average
 Clerk  Very High
 Sr. Clerk Low
 Specialist Low to Average
 Specialist Average
 Sr. Specialist Average to High
 Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)

You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.

Next Item - TRAINING!!!

Here's what you can do:

1) List your staff and the type of class they need
2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what 
type
 of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or
 Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip)
3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700
4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000.
5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.

Next Item - Headhunters!

Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.

Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the 
year that
people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday
ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these 
items, I will
make sure it is added to your budget.

Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will 
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully 
this helps you some.

BH,

I plan to be on vacation July 5-6 (finally) and on the customer trip on the 
7th.  While I am out, Gary Hanks will be keeping our position during 
trading.  Stacey will be in charge of everything else.  I am comfortable that 
everything will be covered.  

I will be back in town Thursday night.  The primary flight for the customer 
trip leaves around 11:30.  Others leave at 3:30 and 5:30(?).   The latest 
idea we had is that Pat would take a later flight on this trip and I will 
take a later flight on the August trip, allowing one of us to be in the 
office for half the day.  I can also come in for the half day on the 7th if 
we decide that is needed.

D

I created deal #439909 for August.

 people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling). =
 He trained our new hire, Jay Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling =
processes at the Katy Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity a=

 Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effecti=
vely schedule our transactions.  Since June, Mike has handled the logistics=
 activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasi=
s, Guadalupe).  Mike most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he=
 saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tr=
acking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (=
on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees t=
hrough the hub).  Mike used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relati=
onships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we s=
cheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  M=
ike has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his =
business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split=
 my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority o=

Don't order any new equipment.  George can use the existing equipment in the space next to me. EB3210F.

Hello Daren,

I spoke with George Smith.  There is no new hire.  It is just him and he will be sitting right next to you.
(only part time) he is still keeping his desk over by me.  Ed Terry does not have any monitors avaliable.
Do you want me to order new equipment for George?  Let me know!

Thanks,
Brandee

Any deals that were confirmed with Equistar for the first of the month should be kept whole throughout the month.  On days where they didn't pull the nom, the buyback goes into effect.  Any shortages should be allocated to the buyback tickets.

D

Daren - I won't be here on Friday but Tom Acton will back me up. 
Megan Parker keeps asking me for an answer - have you had a chance to decide what to do?
Thanks - Julie

Have you heard from Daren yet?  Equistar won't pay the invoice until we bill it correctly.  Thanks for you help.  I know it's bid week.

Megan

I sent this to Daren Farmer - to give me direction for the missing gas volumes. 
The deals went to '0' in Sitara by the Trader and Amiee confirmed it for the following days. Thanks - Julie
March - 
Meter 1373
Deal 165373 for 10,000 (3rd, 4th, 5th) total 310,000 

Deal 157572 for 5,000 (3rd) total 155,000
deal was taken to zero in Sitara - Equistar said it should of been kept whole for the whole month.

What do you want me to do so Equistar can pay their invoice. Thanks - Julie

Julie, 

You need to look at any industrial meter that has buyback and swing deals.  Make sure that the base volume is allocated to the base ticket and all other swings go to the other tickets.

D

Daren,
Is there any Industrial meters in particular I need to watch the imbalances since we are close to the end of the month?

Thanks - Julie
 

You can extend the deal for one day.

D

Cerrito Lastiendas - has meter flow on the 7th and the deal ended on the 6th.  Can we extend the deal for the 48 mmbtu's that flowed
or can I override the meter and add it to a day that flowed less than the nom? The third had 4861 and the nom was for 5000.
Thanks - Julie

 
 

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Daren -
Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc.,  stated  on 4/24/01, re: ENA deal # SA 639615, that their 03/01 price for ENA  sales on CSGT @ B368-Brazos # 368 (i.e. cowtrap), is IF - $.06.  We are invoicing them at HSC GDP DA.  Need to know which price is correct and copy of confirmation. 

Thanks,
Tess

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Julie -
Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system.

Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,

Ok, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.  But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.  Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.

D

Thanks Mary!
Daren, is the info that you need?

The question is not that "cut and dry". However, for the month of March Enron paid Spinnaker @ IF HSC -$0.085. 
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket  #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to Deal ticket  #144264 with is the IF.

Mary -
Do you pay Spinnaker, for gas purchases? (See Daren's question below, re: 03/01 purchase price from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264), Need to know if  price is at IF or Gas Daily?
Thanks,
Tess

Charlene/Cindy/Charles:
Can either of you answer Darren's question to me below? My sales deal is under ENA.
Thanks,
Tess

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

D

Daren -
Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc.,  stated  on 4/24/01, re: ENA deal # SA 639615, that their 03/01 price for ENA  sales on CSGT @ B368-Brazos # 368 (i.e. cowtrap), is IF - $.06.  We are invoicing them at HSC GDP DA.  Need to know which price is correct and copy of confirmation. 

Thanks,
Tess

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

D

I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selling to Equistar
off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport agreement with
HPL or Channel.

On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that is going
to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that for convenience,
can HPL sever the point some other way?

Someone let me hear what you think.

thanks

bob

I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:

1. Channel -  012-15600-02-069	ENA using HPL's capacity - selling to Equistar on Channel

2. Oasis and PGEV - HPL is using ENA's capacity

3.  Tejas Ship and Tejas Gas - Daren says we don't do business often on these pipes as ENA, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time, so ENA would need it's own transport contracts

Let me know if anyone has questions.  Thanks!

Julie, 

I don't have all the deal numbers.  You will need to run a report out of CPR, or find the deals in MOPS and review the prices in Sitara.

This should not be a problem.  They can make it up after the outage.

What would you like to do with the two day outage on May 8th and 9th. Meter 6722 will be shutdown for two days. 
Thanks - Julie

Three Rivers is scheduling PM on May 8 &9, this will involve shutting the
HPL point at Three Rivers for 2 full Gas days.  The nomination is 10.6 for
the month of May, we will makeup gas accordingly before maintance date or
after to balance for the month. Please let me know if you foresee any
problems with these dates, if no response back will go ahead and proceed
with scheduled work.

Mike, 

I would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.  I spoke with Ed the other day and let him know this.  Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.

D

Daren,

I will get with Ed later to find out what his intentions are for me.  If I am not moving to the new building, then I would like to meet with you soon to discuss how all this will work.  I will be out Thursday and Friday for my brother's wedding in Phoenix, but if we can meet before then, I would appreciate it.

Thanks.

Mike

Mike:

Would you please get the George Smith and/or Daren Farmer.

I don't think you will be moving to the other building.  We still want
you to work on the Texas desk.  As soon as you and Ed are ready, we will move you 
back to the 32 floor.

Thanks  

bob

Bob,

It looks as if my days in HPL are numbered as the transition gets closer and closer.  If you have any time, I would like to discuss with you further the exact plans for me.  

I was told that I would be moving over to the other building with this group.  I just want to set up when I will be moving back.  I would like to slip right in and begin work immediately.  I would also like to get a clearer picture on what I will be doing.  I have a few more weeks to learn from my current group, and I will better be able to take advantage of that time if I can have a better understanding of my role in the new group.

Thanks.

Mike

I've got it covered.

Daren,

Equistar will be bringing the Syngas plant back up effective May 10.  While the plant has been down, Enron has been buying the gas back at HSC - $.02.  Their load will come back up on the 10th and the price will be the fixed price on the deal of $5.75.

I appreciate your help on this.  Please let me know if there are any questions.

Hi Daren,

Sorry for the delay.  Here is a blank contract.  Let me know if I can do
anything else for you.

The price should be 4.955.  I have changed Sitara.

Daren, BP invoiced HPL at $4.955 for the deal below, and Sitara shows $4.95.  Can you please verify the pricing?  Thanks.

Hey, man!

Well, let me tell you what's' going on.  Every evening and every weekend fo=
r the last month and a half, I have been painting and working on the house.=
  The previous owners of the house had the worst color scheme going (pink i=
n one room and a portion of the entry way, lime sherbet green in the other =
portion of the entry way).  There is a lot of trim, 4 doors, and a 20 ft ce=
iling in the living room and entry way.  So it is taking quite a while to c=
omplete.  One reason it is taking so long is other things keep breaking (di=
sposal, toilet flanges, alarm system).  In the middle of trying to finish p=
ainting, we ripped out the floors in the bathrooms and entry and laid tile =
(I got the floors ready, we paid to have the tile laid.).  Tonya wants ever=
ything done now.  It doesn't bother her that I haven't finished a single pr=
oject since we started the whole renovation thing.  But, IT'S KILLING ME!  =
I would like just one finished product.  One small room would be fine.  The=
 house is looking a lot better, though.

I'm trying to not let the work take time away from the kids, so I usually s=
tart after 8pm each night.  Plus, when I do work while the kids are running=
 around I pay a high price.  Last week I was painting the baseboards in the=
 dining room, with the gallon of white semi-gloss next to me on the floor. =
 I had earlier used Windex to clean the window seal and had left the bottle=
 in the middle of the floor.  Jake was coming into the room, watching and c=
limbing up and down the step ladder (6 ft;  he climbs to the very top like =
it's nothing.  Other people come in and see him up there and freak out.  We=
 just let him go.).  He is big into cleaning (guts it from his mom), so whe=
n he saw the Windex he ran and picked it up.  I told him to "take it to Mam=
a".  He started out the doorway, but came back in and walked behind me.  I =
just kept working, thinking that he was watching me.  Then I noticed out of=
 the corner of my eye that he had moved closer to me.  When I turned to loo=
k, I just lost my breath.  Jake had dipped the Windex bottle down into the =
paint can, pulled it out and was holding the bottle over our brown carpet. =
 White paint was just pouring off the bottle.  It looked like someone had p=
oured paint straight out of the can onto the floor.  Thank goodness it was =
latex, after about 45 minutes we got it cleaned up.  Cole has helped me wit=
h some of the work, such as sanding the walls.  But, he carried his work a =
little farther than I wanted.  Yesterday, he had a friend over.  They got h=
is tools (play sander/grinder, circular saw, screw drivers), climbed up on =
his bunk bed, and decided they needed to take the texture off the ceiling. =
 You should have seen the mess.

I am taking a break this weekend though.  Cole and I are going camping at L=
ake Livingston.  I am really looking forward to it.  I'm trying to start so=
mething with him (and will include Jake when he gets a little bigger)  wher=
e we do a guy thing each month.  Last month I took Cole to his first Rocket=
s game.  He loved it.  They are getting too big, too fast.

At work, I guess I'm becoming a full fledge trader.  I will be getting my o=
wn book in a couple of days.  I'm pretty nervous about that.  There's not a=
 lot of activity in the training/coaching area around here (hard to believe=
, huh?).  But, we'll see how it goes.  The last of the HPL/AEP people are m=
oving out of the building tonight.  Everything is on course to close the sa=
le on June 1st.

Anyway, I hope you and Linda are doing well.  We'd like to have you over if=
 we ever get the house in presentable shape.

Hi,
What the heck is going on with you these days? Let's see, job,  family, hou=
se all settled ---- I just can't understand why you don't have time  to dro=
p social e-mails to friends. (chuckle)

Megan, 

We did the swap with Pan Energy on 4/28-30 only.  On those days, we received all the gas at Carthage, nothing at Castle Busby.  When we are not operating under the swap, Duke markets the gas that usually comes in at Castle Busby.  Apparently, they sold the gas to Highland in April.

D
Daren:
Did we exchange with Panenergy in April?  If we did, can you send me your nom sheet?  Meter 7052-Castle Busby looks different this month.  Elsa did some deals with Highland Energy at 7052.  We normally buy all of the gas from Duke at this meter when we exchange.  There also wasn't flow every day, so Duke's volume is very small.

Thanks,
Megan

Rodrig, 

There are alot of names on that e-mail.  I hope you spread all those Pina Coladas over the week and not drink them all at once.  Have fun.

I wish we could have purchased that gas at 4.18.  But, the correct price is 5.18.  I have corrected the deal ticket.

What do you think?

Julie ,  CrossTex  said that they were paid incorrectly on deal 681360 for the days of 3/24 thru 3/26/2001.  

We paid them $4.18 and they said that their price should be $5.18.

<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>

I have changed the demand fee.  But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams?  I don't want to pay Tenaska until we get the money from Williams.  Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45,000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45,000/day.

D

We have the actuals from TXU for Tenaska IV for March 2001.  The receipt from Williams was not kept whole, so we have money to recoup from Williams and repay to Tenaska IV.  Please change the following deals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Deal 384258	change demand fee from $2,653,694.95 to $2,607,176.02
Deal 514353	change volume from 45,000 to 44,590

Thanks,
Megan

Mirant had a problem with an EOL transaction where I bought 5,000 from then at $5.10 for the 1st and 2nd.  I agreed to let them out of the deal.  Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.  We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.

D

We invoiced Mirant Americas for deal 705989 and they do not see the deal in their system.  It was for 5,000/day from 4/1 - 4/2 at 5.10 on PG&E Texas.  Can you tell me who you did this deal with at Mirant?

Megan

Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

Is "not going to AEP" considered an accomplishment?  By the way, most of the people who could give performance feedback on me are leaving or have left the company.  I'm sure they thought that I was superior though.

It's that time again.

Please put together a list of accomplishments for the first six months.

I know you can use the system some how, just not sure how.

The price should be IF Waha.  I have changed the price in Sitara.

I have a price discrepancy with one of Stacey's deals with Texaco Natural Gas for April 2001.  It is deal 695976 for 12,000/day.  We have it priced at WAHA gas daily + 0.005 and Texaco says it should be WAHA IF + 0.005.  Rick O'Bannion, the trader at Texaco, has confirmed their price.  Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?

Thanks,
Megan

See below.  The deal was priced at Index but entered as GD in Sitara.  This is going to give you a $75,000 hit for April.

Need price correction for 04/01/01 - 04/30/01 for deal # 413462 to agree with info from Lee below. Currently, deal shows for 04/01 first 10,000/d @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP DH.    Sitara audit shows dfarmer changed price on 05/08/01/

Thanks!
Tess

SA 413462 is not the buyback, it's the swing ...

the first 10,000/d under SA 413462 should be HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A.
anything over 10,000/d should be HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA

this is for all months from Oct00 to Sep01

What do you think?

Darren-
Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

Thanks!

Sabrae, 

See if you can find Danny's deal book and verify the price for the deal listed below.

D

For once his is not a Panenergy question.  For sale deal 707274, DEFS says the price on 4/4 should be 5.25 and we have 5.20 in Sitara.  Can you confirm this price for me?

Megan

Physically...yes.  Mentally...I've been gone a long time.  I'm trying to make a decision whether to stay or go.  How about you?  How are things going?

D

Daren,

Are you still here?

The deal has been changed.

D

Deal 709296 should be on ASTRA Power LLC,  we have it on ADTRA Resources, Inc.  I spoke with their trader Sherry Wayman and she said that she did the deal with Daren Farmer and it should be ASTRa Power LLC  for April 2001.

Could you fix asap because payment is due on 25th.

Sandi, 

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

D

Darren,
do you know what the situation is with getting that Tenaska agreement signed? it is on a list to be assigned to HPL in the sale and I don't think it has ever been executed--I know you left  me  a message a week or so ago about this--is there any information that i owe you ?

Carlos, 

Is this the gas on Blue Dolphin?

D

I'm trying to get this to pull through to Unify for payment to Spinnaker. Volume Management shows "no detail".
Sitara indicated  685 mmbut 4/1-4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment MUST be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to Spinnaker.
Thank you and Please advise.
Mary Ellenberger 5-8773 (713-345-8773)

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

Thanks,

Joyce

Deal 717768 should be kept whole.  This is a baseload purchase.  Deal 544392 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls.

D

FYI.  Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.  Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings.

Daren -
Howard came by and asked me to check with you regarding deal 717768 starting 
April 6th for 2,000 - it was created by you April 5th. . He wasn't sure if it was a buy back and if you wanted me to
link the buy back deal to 692725. The buyback deal for this is normally 544392(when it was on meter 8216). Do you want
this deal to act as the buy back or stay whole.  Thanks - Julie  

receipt 2,000 deal 717768 - buy back?
delivery 5,500 deal 544388 - daily swing
delivery 8,500 deal 692725 - stays whole first 

Attached is the June 2001 nomination for our takes under the Gas Sales and
Purchase Contract between TXU Fuel Company (previously TUFCO) and SDS.  Please
advise should you have any questions concerning the attached.

Thanks,

(See attached file: SDSNOM.xls)

 - SDSNOM.xls 

First of the Month Nomination for June 2001:

Deliveries into Eastrans from HPl will be 20,000 MMBtu/dy.

The redeliveries will be 17,000 MMBtu/dy from Fuels Cotton Valley and 3,000
MMBtu/dy into the Cartwheel.

I received a fax from CP&L for June 2001.  They nominated 20K a day

Done.

We need to change the demand fee on deal 384258 for Tenaska IV for 4/01.  The Williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed, so our expenses decreased.  Please change the amount from $2,979,909.91 to $2,862,531.95.  I have attached the revised spreadsheet.

On May 27th a lufkin Industrial market will go down by 5,000.  We are going to move this sale to Lyondell meter #   5045    .  The sales price will remain at Index minus $.12.   The sale will remain at Lyondell for approximately 2 weeks.     Since the screen has fallen about $1 this should be a good thing for us and a very nice thing for Entex to do for us.

Thanks,

Janet

Channelview I believe.  That's where I put it.

D

Which Lyondell plant will this be going to?  5045 is not a valid meter number off of HPL.

Jeff, 

I will be happy to meet with you on Wednesday.

I got Howard Camp to help and he told me what to do.  The deal is in Volume Management now.  This brokered deal needs to be tracked every month in order for this not to be a recurring problem.  Does anyone know who in Logistics I need to talk to?

I want to confirm the May MidCon volumes for Mobil - I think it is 30,000 mmbtu/day?

Hey, Ken.  How's everything going?  I thought about you yesterday here at work and wanted to call but I lost your number.  Send it back to me when you get a chance.  Anyway, we re-started one of the activities you used to love:  balancing Exxon Katy without going through HPL.  It has been a nightmare.  In fact, the guys are still trying to balance the first (it's now noon).  It's been one daisy chain after another.  One small piece changes and it affects 3 other people.  I get tickled every time I think about you going through that.  It has been quite a bit different trading without HPL.  Yesterday, I handled Waha pretty well.  But I got bent over for the weekend.  It has been pretty tough balancing out each point without having transports and storage.

Did you have anything going on over Memorial Day?  We stayed home and worked around the house.  Nothing exciting, but a string of bad luck I'll tell you about sometime.

I hope ya'll are doing good.  Talk to you later.

D 

Done.

Daren:
Please enter the demand charge on deal 384258 for the May 2001 Tenaska IV sale.  Mike Olsen's spreadsheet has $2,069,556.32.  I already have the agency fee on deal 514353.

OW, 

I went through the list on the sort by pipe and highlighted the curves/mapping we can delete (yellow) and those we can change (orange).  The only curves we will have left are Katy, Waha, HSC, Agua Dulce, and Thompsonville.  I expect to be using Thompsonville in 6 months to a year.  If it easier or cleaner to delete that curve and add it when we need it, that will be fine.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

D

Hey Gang,

Attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by Russ Severson... Please take a peek and let us know if we need to change, add/delete, update any points/mappings going forward in a Netco environment... For instance, I would like to change Texoma to Carthage on the curve mappings... Also, I would like to delete all derived curves, leaving only Carthage, KatyTailgate, and Agua Dulce.
The other physical locations would be ShipChannel, Waha and Katy (non-tailgate)... Let me know your thoughts... O'Neal 3-9686

 << File: CurveMapping_Texas.xls >> 

James, 

I just sent a message to Jeff Hodge asking how we can handle this.  I will let you know as soon as I hear something from him. (I left messages with him prior to today to discuss this deal.)

D

Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant.  The current issues are as follows:

November Gas Sales					$600,377.50
October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges	$108,405.00
Cleburne receivable from Enron				$708,782.50

Less: November Gas Agency Fees			($54,000.00)

Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron			$654,782.50

Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU.  Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU?

Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also.  This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month.  Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized.  However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November.  Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec).  I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne.

Please advise as to the status of these bills.  You can reach me at 713-853-7280.  Thanks.

James

Jeff, 

The message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.  We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.  In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.  In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines.  All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska.  ENA receives a management fee).  Can we pay intercompany bills?  How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?

Bob, 

Who is collecting the hard copies or e-mails of contracts?  I've got the Guadalupe contracts now.

D

On Monday we have to file a "transition plan" with Louise Kitchen for NETCO. She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)

Tks - Bob

Bobby, 

Unfortunately, we will not be able to make it Saturday night.  We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife, sort of a late Christmas get together.  I hate that we are going to miss it, but I will touch base with you later.

Also, please change the e-mail addresses you have for me and Tonya to:  dfarmer70@houston.rr.com and tjfarmer@houston.rr.com

Thanks.

Happy New Year!
 
Next Saturday, January 12, is our get together  dinner.  Instead of going out to a restaurant, Myra and Rodney Burke  graciously offered the use of their home for a nice catered dinner.  Myra  has a friend who will be preparing a full meal for us, served buffet  style.  We'll meet at 7:00 until 10'ish.  I'm thinking the  dress should be snappy casual (I don't really know what that means, but it  sounds good).  We're going to have an appetizer, salad, herb pork loin  something or other, vegetables, dessert, the whole fancy dinner  thing.  It should be great.
 
The caterer needs an exact count of how many  will be there, so let me know by next Wednesday, January 9,   (incidently, our first NEON back) that you'll be there.  Brad Cox wants to  treat you to dinner, so all you need to bring is yourself, and if married, your  spouse. 
 
So call a babysitter, email me back, and lets  get together! 
 
(I've heard some people may not have gotten the  emails concerning this date and the arrangements--do me a favor and  please make sure your co-leaders know about this).
 
Bobby
 
 
 
(Rodney and Myra live in Terra Nova at 5506  Nodaway--281-251-2778)
 

 
This is what we've got so far.  Due to our agency activity on Lone Star, I do not want to contact them yet.  But, I have a copy of a contract they sent me a couple of months ago we can use.

look on the texas tab
Listed below are some guidelines for gathering the necessary information for NETCO contract setup so we can get as much done as possible prior to our start date. I suggest each manager start making the phone calls and if necessary get others at the desk to help out. Again, the goal is to get hard copies of the contracts in our hands for review so we can fill out all of the necessary information ahead of time. Take good notes on the questions that come up when speaking with the pipes. We can get legal involved as needed when major issues surface. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions, tks - Bob
 
Hi All-

Attached above is the master list of contracts we'll need for Day 1 of NEWCO.  As the footnotes indicate, we'll also need new business party ID's/passwords, an EBB agreement for all pipes and a TPA for each EDI pipe (Tammy & I will be working on TPA's and EBB's).  The timing indicated assumes that we have a clear NEWCO structure, that the NEWCO credit status has been identified, and that a DUNS number has been established.  The two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through Legal on each end, so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3-5 days even for pooling agreements.  For the LDC's and intrastates, we'll need to specifically identify what each requires.

As we discussed, we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information:

Pipeline contact name and number (I know some of you sent me this b/f--but pls make sure that it's the legal/regulatory contact, not your business counterpart)
Credit requirements for a NEW entity with an "A" credit rating (they may just refer you to the tariff, if so, pls. ask them for a specific site so we can do the research)
Get a sense of the reaction of the pipe/LDC regarding credit for the new entity--we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting.
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old Enron bills, just reiterate that we're setting up a completely new entity and give them Bob's, mine, or Jeff Hodge's name to discuss the estate issues.
If there are different requirements for different service levels (ie, pooling vs. IT vs. FT), pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe.
We need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level--pls. ask the pipe/LDC to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it.  Once we have those together, I'll run the traps with Legal.

It would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier, then work on the second.

I will be out of the office Thursday & Friday, but please call me on my cell phone at 713-516-2574 with any questions.

Thanks,
Suzanne

These troubled times mandate that Enron take a fresh look at our contingency plans for conducting business away from the office.  Bob Superty has asked me to put together a survey on processes and equipment that could be used if schedulers could not get into the office and use normal business processes and resources.

Please forward this memo and ask your respective schedulers to take a moment to fill in the requested data from your desk spreadsheets below.  We would like to have all responses received before November 1st.

Hey, Ken.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, th=
rough Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and =
an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that Enron would be =
here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things=
 really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually s=
tarted talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes=
 that I'm not so sure about.  Ed Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over th=
e origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and=
 Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading de=
sk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away=
.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the fina=
ncial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in Columbu=
s.  He's also going to stay in Columbus with this responsibility.  So, this=
 may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the fam=
ily.

The home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My love=
ly wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  =
It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball g=
oes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to H=
alloween.  Cole is going to be a policeman, Jake is going to be a jailbird/=
prisoner.  Cole has already handcuffed Jake a number of times, he loves it.=
  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation =
that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff pl=
anned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in Sa=
n Antonio doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we=
 did things around here (like Children's Museum).

Big game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off=
?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.

How about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.

D

Oh my!!!!
=20
How those chickens come home to  roost.

I hope you are doing OK. Fine  here.

We must do lunch  soon.......................

Done,.

Darren:
Please change the demand fee for 12/00 on deal 529856 from $918,566.13 to $889,757.13.  We had a volume adjustment.

Thanks,
Megan

Bob, 

Tom is asking aobut the budget info.  When do you think that I can get it?

D

Darren, plan is to have the necessary contracts in place under the new NETCO name so we can do business on all key pipes. Regarding the Intrastates I suggest you think about the key ones so we have them on the list and get basic contracts in place once we have a new name and parent. Also what services you want on each so we get all the necessary contracts done. 

I'll get you some budget info shortly, tks - Bob

Bob, 

For the Texas Desk, Mike Olsen and I will start out handling the scheduling activities.  As we start up we will not be doing a lot of shipping on the intrastate pipes.  We will primarily be utilizing hub and cartwheel agreements and net outs.  Trading primarily on the Waha, Katy , and Carthage hubs.  I will cover Katy and Carthage.  Mike will continue to cover Waha and any shipping activities on the intrastate pipes.  I will need a second person fairly soon after we begin trading again (within a month or two).  

What are you thinking that we need to look into on the intrastates?

Also, with message of setting up new budgets, can you have Brandy send me a copy of the budget we had in place for Texas 2002? 

Thanks.

D

Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below. 

For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a "final or startup" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.

In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me. 

Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

Thanks - Bob

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Hey, Man.  Can you fix the schedule so that I can play somebody this week?  

D

All of the Exxon Katy points are in Waller County, Tx.

Please be advised that we have discrepancies with the  State and County information for the meter No. (s) listed on the attached spreadsheet.
Will you please review this spreadsheet and provide the State and County information that you may have for the listed meters.

If you are not the scheduler for this pipe please forward this to the appropriate scheduler.

The entity I trade with is TXU Gas Distribution.  I verified this with my contact this morning.  So, deal 1085609 is correct.

D
Can you make the change?

Thanks 
Richard
Rich & Ellen:

We have some problems with the following two counterparties: TXU Gas Distribution & Enbridge Consumers Gas.  For TXU Gas Distribution, this is a unconsolidated division of TXU Gas Company and all deals booked under TXU Gas Distribution should be confirmed as TXU Gas Company.  I understand this is not the case.  For Enbridge Consumers Gas, this is not a valid entity.  At some point it will be a correct name, but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under Consumers Gas Co. Ltd.  

Each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above: Sitara 1085609 for TXU and 1086002 for Enbridge Consumers Gas.  

Please advise if there is something I need to do from my end to get this issue resolved.  

Thanks,

I know the following:

1) Gulf Plains plant is in Nueces County.  
2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County.
Check with George to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.  I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.

D

I cant figure out what to make of this...

This is a follow up to the e-mail I sent earlier in th month.
Please be advised that we have discrepancies with the  State and County information for the meter No. (s) listed on the attached spreadsheet.
Will you please review this spreadsheet and provide the State and County information that you may have for the listed meters.

I believe that we did have some activity on Blue Dolphin, but it was done by the Wellhead group.  You should send the Vol Mgmt people to George Smith.
 
D

Two quick questions... 

Volume Management seems to think that we had business on Blue Dolphin Pipeline for August 2001.  I told them that we had none, and that whatever they have is AEP business.  They insisted that it was ours and sent down Allocation Statements from Blue Dolphin.  WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.

As for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.  The map has 17 plants listed with pipeline connects.  I will call them for capacities and flexibility.

All errors were taken care of by Jay and I with little trouble. 

Thanks. 

Mike 

FYI.

FYI - Big day Monday to get everything cleaned tracked and balanced in order to run the draft that night. I'm waiting for a call to see if we can only draft through the 14th to alleviate some of the burden. Sorry for the short notice I was waiting for clarification from Settlements.

Wendy, Richard please coordinate how the scheduled quantities turn on/off will work

Tks - Bob

Yes - on an ongoing basis, we will be running a mass draft on the night of the 15th each month.  We also have reporting requirements for the last day of the month, but our normal draft process will cover that.  Let me know if you have more questions.  Thanks.

Bryce - have you got a plan in place yet on what will be required going forward?

Bob

Leslie, Bryce - Want to let the troops know what the plan will be moving forward on your monetization effort regarding the need to be tracked and balanced by a certain date. 

Please get back to me, tks - Bob. 

Mike Olsen will be the critical user for Texas.

All:
From Matt's response it sounds like you might want to specify exception personnel for 8-12, 12 thru 4:00, and 4 thru 6 Normal business hours and not end of the month, holidays or long weekends.

RP

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.  

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

RP

The critical users on the east desk using path manager will be Meredith Homco, Clarissa Garcia, Christina Sanchez and Victor Lamadrid. If you could alert us as to when y'all are invoking watchdog to kick logistics out, that would be great.  THANKS

The west desk critical users will all use path manager. The users will be Shannon Groenewold, Daniel Lisk, Suzanne Christiansen, Corey Wilkes, Jackie Adams, Shelly Mendel, Stacey Brewer, Walt Spiegelhauer and starting next week Joshua Blair.

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Just wanted to let ya'll know that we get the attached report each week from Vol Mgmt.  We don't have any pending issues (we haven't had many since this started), which I like to see.  Thanks for staying on top of it all.

D

 

The revised weekend nom is attached.  Have a good weekend.

done.

Darren:
Please change the demand fees on deal 384258 for Tenaska IV to the numbers below.  Thanks.

6/01	from 3,559,472.93 to 3,541,521.53
8/01	from 4,116,036.00 to 4,117,198.00

Bob. 

I could have sworn that I sent you this information earlier.  But I can't find it in my e-mail anywhere, so here it is:

Highest Priority
El Paso Gas Transmission Texas Pipeline (formerly PGE Texas and Valero)	Hub contract, Park & Lend contracts, inter- and intrastate transport
East Texas Gas Transmission (Duke Energy Field Services)			Cartwheel agreement, transport

Secondary Priority
Guadalupe Pipeline (Duke Energy Field Services)					Intra- and interstate transport
Oasis Pipeline									"	"	"	"
TXU Gas Distribution (Lone Star Pipeline)						"	"	"	"
Houston Pipe Line								"	"	"	"
El Paso Field Services Channel							"	"	"	"
Oneok Westex (Westar)								"	"	"	"
Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline (Midcon)						"	"	"	"
Tejas Pipeline

The contracts on the pipes listed under "Highest Priority" are required for us to trade in the 3 main areas in Texas (EOL).  We must have these on day one.  The secondary contracts/pipes will be used soon after start up and are ranked in order of importance.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Again, I thought that I sent this to you a couple of weeks ago. Sorry for the delay.

Texas and Wellhead were grouped under George.  I adjusted Texas, but not Wellhead.  I also added the market hubs that we trade, under the pipeline section.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey kids, Why don't we pool our resources and get " El Jefe " something nice?  Not like last year... I won't mention names (Donna).... when some individuals within the team didn't want to include the rest of us in their "reindeer games" for bosses day. Any suggestions? Round of golf, gift certificate??? I nominate Suzanne to collect the money. Any objections?
THANKS

 Chronicles 7:14

 Bryant Gumbel recently interviewed Billy Graham's daughter.

 Gumbel: "Why didn't God stop this or do something about this?"

 Billy Graham's daughter: "For years we have told God we didn't want
 Him in our schools. We didn't want Him in our government and we
 didn't want Him in our finances and God was being a perfect gentleman in
 doing just what we asked Him to do. We need to make up our mind - do
 we want God or do we not want Him. We cannot just ask Him in when
 disaster strikes."

 Bryant Gumbel was silent.

George and Daren,

Will Tuesday, October 9, 2001 be a good time to set up an hour to cross train your groups on Volume Management processes?  I guess it is not really cross training, but showing them our processes and how logisitics impact our actualizing process.

How does your afternoon look on Tuesday?  I'm thinking around 2:00.

The supply from the desk-to-desk transaction (#1075281) is pathed to the transport.  The 1023 contract is an ENA agreement.  So, deal 1075281 transfers the gas to ENA.  ENA then transports the gas on it's agreement on Lone Star.

D

Darren:
I see the new path for the desk to desk in Nov 2000.  You pathed it as a buy/sell.  Should it be on contract 1023 where the old path was?  We have a transport statement from TXU for contract 1023 that has 21,309 mm.  
Megan
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Annette, 

The transport statement we received from Lone Star did not show that this gas flowed.  That is why we have not paid yet.  We are in discussions with the pipe to find out what happened.  I will let you know as soon as something is determined.

D

To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  

6/7	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.71	between Roger & Daren
6/12	sold 8500 to ENA @ 3.78	between Roger & Daren
6/14	sold 5000 to ENA @ 4.16	between Roger & Daren
6/20	sold 10000 to EOL @ 3.95	between Roger & EOL
6/23-25	sold 10000/d to EOL @ 3.57	between Roger & EOL

Thank you, in advance, for your help with this.

Megan, 

I have created deal # 1075281 to cover a sale from Cleburne to ENA.  I also repathed Unify.  This should clean up the UA4 after the actuals on the old path between Deal 384237 and 502861 are zeroed out.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Darren:
I am working with Jim Pond to clean up the UA4 that has been booked to Cleburne since the beginning of the deal.  We are starting with November 2000.  Gas accounting has booked 21,309 MMBtu as UA4 for November, which is related to deal 502861 on the Texas desk.  It looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from Williams (deal 384237) on the Cleburne desk and moved it to ENA's transport contract with deal 502861.  The print screen below shows the deal from Zone transport to ENA-Texas.  I think we need a deal from Cleburne to Zone Transport to complete to deal path and clean up the UA4.  Can you review the deals for November and let me know what you think?  Jim says there is UA4 every month of this deal and this may be the reason.  I will have to check each month.

Thanks,
Megan

Hey Ken.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all t=
aken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the we=
ek before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a =
great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of get=
ting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them=
 all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I =
was thinking.  Cole wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buz=
z Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder =
and more excited.  Jake was primarily interested in in opening presents, he=
 didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up=
 and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other=
 day, Cole and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.=
  Cole likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was=
 working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being abo=
ut eight feet tall).  Well Jake was chomping at the bit to run through it. =
 After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have se=
en his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of t=
he year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  =
It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister ca=
me in the weekend before Christmas.  Tonya's parents and sister came in Fri=
day.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downsta=
irs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  =
That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord=
 for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.

How was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids we=
re in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys =
bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  Tonya's dad an=
d I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of bal=
ls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sens=
e, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.

Done.

Darren:
Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for June 2001 from $3,578,257.50 to $3,559,472.93.  Our transport expenses went down.  We are having some volume problems with this month, so we may need to change it again.  I'm trying to keep Kyle Lilly and Jim Pond happy on the GL side.

Thanks,
Megan

Bryce, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.

I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.  Why were these deals actualized to zero?

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

he doesn't have to go if you will wear the horns and play the buck like he does.

but you will only go if charlie goes?

Anthony, 

Can you change the counterparty name on deal 93836 to Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc.?

D

Daren,
Will you let me know when this change has been made?  I need to get some payments finaled by 3pm tomorrow.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

This ticket starts with 7/99 production.  How were all of the other months paid?

D

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).  

please see attached. this includes Richard Pinion's changes for Logistics.

Hi All,

Thanks and have a nice holiday!

Hey, Ken

We had a good holiday.  Except for the trip back...it usually takes around 9 hours.  Last night it took 12.  Other than that everything was good.  Played a little golf (play may be too strong a word).  Watched a little football.  Our game with Texas was much better than I expected.  I can't believe Colorado ran over Nebraska like that.  And the OU game...I love college football.  It is so much more exciting than the pros.

Right now, I'm just sitting here watching the stock price bounce around 3.85.  The big boys have been huddling quite a bit today.  I think that we are close to the end.  Layoffs should be announced tomorrow.

So, did you get the Christmas tree after the game?  20 footer?  We'll be out this weekend getting ours and putting up the lights.  Jake doesn't know what's going on.  But, Cole is all excited.  Everything he sees, he wants for "Chrimsas".  Knowing Jake, I will probably have to anchor the tree on all sides to keep him from bringing it down.  We'll see how it goes.

I hope you had happy holiday, even with the game.  

D

Hi,
 
I know the stock sucks and things look  black, but I hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving and a good trip.
 
At this 10 seconds there is 2 min. left  in the 1st quarter of the Neb./Colo. game and I have struck my colors.  Discretion being the better part of valor. My Aggie neighbor saw me taking them  down and just laughed ......... can you imagine?
 
We sure had the polls fooled for awhile  ............. and some of us more ignorant fans.

I sent an e-mail to anthony campos on the 19th asking him to change the counterparty.  I don't have the access to do that.  If he can change the name, then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path.  I just sent him another message today.

Status?  We need to get it done this GL month, meaning it has to get in, pathed, actualized before mass draft (unless you want to manually draft).

I emailed Mike Olsen, scheduler for Centana, to put the deal in Sitra and path it.  He was out today but will be back in tomorrow.  I will call him again tomorrow to make sure he gets it in the system before close.   Any questions, give me a call.  Thanks.

Well, I'm here.  We are not trading.  Actually, we are just hanging around, playing games and shooting the breeze, waiting for the next news story.  It's really odd.  It really is sad seeing all the layoffs.  Especially, when I think of the $ the bigwigs carry home while the honest working people search for a way to earn a living.

Anyway, things are fine for me and the family.  I'd better go.  We've got a crossword competition starting.

D

I love it. A stock under a dollar that  trades 200-300 million shares a day. I've died and gone to heaven. It's more  liquid than natural gas.
 
To tell you the truth though I'd rather  lose this opportunity than have what has happened to all the employees. The  people upstairs, now that's another matter. Some of us warned of this in the  early stages, but we were shown the door. (Which actually turned out to be the  best for us)
 
Are you still trading? It must be a zoo  down there.

Mike - here you go.  You might as well bridge back the pipes now and be done with it.  Let me know when you start this and I will help if you want me to.

The 4429 is good.

This was a weekend deal with Mirant.  On your spreadsheet, the volume shows 4429.  This is also the volume that I confirmed with Mirant.  The deal is in Unify for 5429.  Could you please check and let me know which volume is good. 

Mike

Bob, 

I highlghted some changes on your spreadsheet.  Look over these and call me if you have questions.  A couple of the deals have Gas Daily tiers, so I moved them down in the sheet.  I would like for you to make the changes tomorrow after trading.

D

 

   

Daren,

Please click on the Supply Analysis tab of the attached spreadsheet to view the wellhead volumes through 4/4/01.

Bob

 

I've been trying to call ya'll.  Both lines. One keeps ringing.  The other one gives a busy signal sometimes, keeps ringing sometimes.  Is the answering machine not hooked up?  Or are ya'll not clicking over?  Anyway.  We're doing fine.  Just wanted to let you know that I tried to call.

AP-College Station Texas----
Texas A&M football practice was delayed on Monday for nearly two  hours at Kyle Field. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room  happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery  substance on the practice field. 
Head coach R.C. Slocum immediately suspended practice while the FBI was  called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined  that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line.  
Practice was resumed when FBI Special Agents decided that the team would not  be likely to encounter the substance again.

Isn't the deal pathed from Exxon King Ranch (Deal 210722) to Reliant?

D

Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

Megan, 

We didn't operate HPL in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies.  The supply for these sales was the entire HPL system.  You can calculate the WACOG on HPL as an estimated cost for each day or month.  But I can't give you a specific supply cost or deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.

D

Darren:
I have a request from Jim Coffey that I hope you can help me with.  He wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the GLO.  I can follow the ENA deals in path Manager, but I am having a hard time with the HPLC deals.  It looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract.  I can't tell, though, how the gas got to the 215.  Can you tell me where we got the supply for HPLC to sell and at what price?  I need to know for Jan through May.  The GLO deal numbers are below, if you need them.

Megan

Jan 01		547201
Feb 01		591307

Daren,

Could you tell me who your Gas Control people are?  Gary Bryan has asked me to put together a contact list.

Michael Salinas
(713) 345-3644

We had to get the gas from somewhere.  Did Tejas owe HPL gas and make the delivery to settle an imbalance?  It looks like ENA transported the gas on Tejas for Feb.  Have you checked to see if ENA transported on Tejas for Mar?

D
Daren,

Yes, the gas on Deal 210722 is going to Reliant, however, it needs to be Brokered instead of Service as Tejas does not show any transport.  I don't know if it can be changed or if a new deal needs to be set up.

Thanks,

Buddy

Brandee, 

You're in the system now.  thanks.

D

Hey Cliff, 

Which Rogue Spear do you have? 

D

I have created deal 1150179 to cover this supply.  

Mike - Please see that this gets pathed in MOPS and POPS and let Megan know when completed.

Thanks.

D

Darren:
I have another HPLC issue...I received an invoice from Four Square Gas Company today for May 2001 gas that was never paid.  They have invoiced 1,654 at 4.825 (HSC - .085) at meter 986887.  I did not see a deal in Unify, so I went to POPS to find the meter.  I found that the gas was pathed to the Strangers Gas contract.  Historically, HPLC has always purchased the gas at this meter from Four Square, but it doesn't look like a deal was ever entered for May.  The April deal number was 695469.  Did HPLC purchase this gas in May? 

Megan

OW, 

What do you think about the orig deduct?  How do we usually handle orig on something like this?

D

Cost centers 11814 and 27117 are rolling to Texas Gas Trading.

Megan

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Darren
Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Eric:
I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.

Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

Karen, 

Mike Olsen currently reports to me.  I fully recommend Mike as a candidate for the Origination Track.  I don't think that he has decided which path he wants to take regarding his future, but I know that he would be very interested in discussing this track.  Please contact him at your convenience.  Thanks.

Daren
All,

ENA is building an ENA Origination Track similar to that of the Trading Track.     Originators on both the Gas & Power side at the VP level have bought into the development of this program.    The management of the program will be the originators themselves under Louise Kitchen.   There will be structured rotations for the Analysts & Associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in Origination.

The below people, according to our records, are currently in your groups.   These candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and/or have performed well in the previous prc.     Prior to contacting the below Analysts & Associates, I want to ensure your buy-in/recommendation of these candidates.      All selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the Origination management team (both gas & power) prior to joining the program.

I would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in November to commence interviews.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I will be happy to explain the program in greater detail.

Kind regards,

Karen

I need this information ASAP - not only for while you are out, but also for purposes pertaining to our big move to the new building, which (by the way) is next Friday, November 9th.  WOO HOO!  I'll be sending more information to you soon about the move.

Thanks,

Hey, Derrick

Thanks for the golf journal.  I'm looking forward to using it.  I've read through most of it already, and it looks easy enough to follow.  Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.  If I play like the last time (when David and I played over Christmas), I'll be buying balls from the club house.  Anyway, I hope you are doing well.

I believe that I have received your message in error. My name is Daren Farmer and I work in the Texas gas trading area for Enron.  If you will send the name of the person and department you are trying to contact at Enron, I will assist you in communicating with that person.  Thanks.

hey Ken, 

Let's do lunch next week.  We are moving into the new building this weekend.  I'll be able to show you around (if I'm still here).

We had a tough football weekend.  It's about time we got beat.  We didn't deserve the wins we had.  Anyway, I've got to get to work.  Trying to break $12.00 today.  It's kind of odd...moving into a brand new building when your stock price has reached an all-time low...

D

Done.

ENE @ 9.90?  I don't think I will be able to eat for a week.  Maybe you should bring a bullet next week and put me out of my misery.

That's fine with me. As always, my calendar is extremely flexible.

Hi All, 

Are there any employees that are leaving your group and/or coming to your group during the week of November 12, 2001?    Please let me know by Friday, November 9th at 12 noon.   

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

I don't have any problems with this.

I don't see a problem with this.......Does anyone else have any concerns???

Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on May 6th next month.

Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049

Thanks

Rita, 

I began digging further into how this was scheduled yesterday.  It does not look very good.  I will re-work it today and let you know when I'm done.

D

Because the payback was done for October 2001, we can't do it in POPS so we will have to make manual entries to clear the imbalance from the books and show the sale from HPL to ENA.

Rita, 
What time frame do intend to do this in?  I believe this contract is no longer effective after May 31, so if it is in October you will have to reactivate the transport contract so you can book it in POPS. 
HC 

AC, 

Are you still there?

D

Done.

Michael,
Can you back date deals 83347 and 83905  to start 6/1/99 through  12/31/99 for the Black Marlin meter.   The meters are on the deals for 1/1/2001 through 5/31/01, but I need to book ua4 back to 6/1/99?

Mike, 

I very much appreciate what you have done for our desk.  Let me look into the promotions within and out of the analyst program.  I want to take the best option possible.

D

Daren,

I have no problem sticking around with the group, it is a compliment and I am glad that you all appreciate what I have been able to contribute to the group.  I just want your opinion on something.

One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.  

Just a thought, let me know what you think.

Mike

Let's og today if you can, or tomorrow.  I'm available anytime after 11:00.  Are you going to try your badge again?  They are reviewing the photos now, along with new scanners. 

D

Hi,
 
How are you doing? Still feel like lunch?  
 
I'm sad about Enron's demise. A lot  of people got hurt on this one. 
 
What the hell ....... I feel like lunch  and you probably need to get out of there so let me know what's good for  you.
 
Ken

We are in the same building.  The move got postponed until next week.  Using the same badges.  I have the same phone #.  Parking is the same.  I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.  Whew...I think I covered everything.  See you in a little while.

D

Today is good.
    Treebeards ??
    Are you in new building?? Where??
    Same badges ?? or different?
    Your number the same?? (I'll call if lost or a problem)
    Parking?? Anything different I should know.
See you between 11 and 11:15.........

Oh, one other question. I-45 --- any construction delays between here and
there. Have not been downtown since last we had lunch.

Bet you didn't think this would be so difficult.

See you
Ken

Rita, 

In order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).  I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at King Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.

D

I really like you Eric and would like to spend some time learning how you are such a master of basis trading.

Jerry D. F.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Hey baby, honey-bun, goodlookin, goodlovin, sexy sweet thang!

We may need to start talking to Byron or someone about investing and all of that.  Can you find out how much he charges, one visit and continuing?  he sent out an e-mail about ira's.  they are waving fees for those for lifetime thru 12/31/01.  

Anyway, I love you.

This ticket starts with 7/99 production.  How were all of the other months paid?

D

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

Well, the staff level is prettly low here, for just about every group related to HPL.  Stacey did leave, so I am back to trading Waha.  However, it's going a lot better this time.  I am actualy enjoying it somewhat.  With the majority of the desk leaving, I am looking into moving into the day trading arena for the new Texas Desk.  We'll see how that goes.  Bidweek was kinda rough this time.  In addition to Stacey leaving during the middle of the week, we have some major outages on the A/S line where we have to stay balanced on Texoma and balanced on the south end.  The line has been split into two seperate systems.  Handling that has been a constant battle.  Plus, with the pending sale, people just don't care as much about the business.  It's a little harder to get things done.

Anyway, things are going pretty good at the house.  But, the list of things to fix and do keeps getting longer and longer.  We are extremely busy.  The kids are loving the stairs.  You ought to see Jake go down.  We taught him to turn around backwards and crawl down the stairs on his belly.  Well, that was too slow for him.  Now, he get's on his belly, feet up in the air, and slides down, barely skiming the stairs.  He looks a penguin sliding down a snow bank, except on his stomach.  Cole is doing his best to either run Jake off or make him tough.  Cole runs over Jake with his toys, pushes Jake out the way, or just walks right over him.  It doesn't affect Jake, though, he gets right back up and keeps on going.

Anyway, I need to get back to work.  Hope the family is doing well.  Maybe you can come down for lunch next week.  I'll give you a call in the next couple of days.

D

Did you survive bid week?
 
I hear you lost another employee (Stacey). If you need someone  to work for you I suppose I'm free (in a freedom sense, not $). Do you have any  staff left?
 
Just giving you a hard time. (like you need one)
 
Gotta run. Almost have my *&%$#!!@# taxes done. If people  had to write a personal check every quarter for their taxes there would be some  big changes. It sucks.? ?Later,?Ken? ? ??

You need to path the change at mtr 8055.  You should not path the buyback at mtr 1040 (Only deals 538950 and 702826 should be pathed with volume.  All other deals at mtr 1040 should be pathed with zero volumes.)

D

Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie

March Midcon volumes at Mobil should be 30,000 each day.  Any swings should be on the buyback HPL has with Mobil.

I am trying to forward this money to Tenaska tomorrow, so if you could change this before 8:00am tomorrow, I'd appreciate it.

Megan

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Megan

Matt, 

Each month, prior to bidweek, I pull up a monthly range in Path Manager to get a feel of how many of our swing customers operated in a prior month (or a month in a prior year).  I have never had problem with this before, and I have done this task every month since Unify was put into production.  When the problem occurred this month, I was attempting to view Apr 1-30, 2000 on Houston Pipe Line, with HPL as the shipper.  This information is very important for my bidweek preparation.  So, I need to continue perfomorming this operation each month.  If needed, I can wait until 5 pm top view the range.

D

Darren,
Do you know if you were running pulling up the Path Manager for a date range around 10:51?  How do you normally pull up the Path Manager?  Please let me know as we're attempting to find out what caused this problem and if we should restrict access on the date range functionality.  If you were only pulling it for a day, that would be okay.
 
Thanks

Brian, 
 
At 11:20am this morning, a stored procedure (source_dest_list_range_sp, Line #172) being run by Daren Farmer caused the tempdb transaction log on unifygasp to fill up.  This procedure is run routinely by many other users on a daily basis without incident.  At the time of the failure, this stored procedure had been running since 10:51am, or roughly 30 minutes.  I was notified via automatic page at 11:24am; the page indicating that there was 200MB free.  I immediately checked tempdb, which was by full by this time.  Three attempts to clear the transaction log prior to 11:30am finally resulted in a cleared transaction log.
 
Kishore noiced shortly thereafter that there was a problem in the way that Sybase was accounting for its free space, a condition which may have been crucial to the failure since nearly 5GB of space was apparently unavailable to the transaction log.  A reboot of unifyprod2 at 1:40pm cleared this condition.

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

D

   

Daren,

Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:

Counterparty			Meter			Volumes		Price				Period		Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC	9876			85mmbtu/d		100% GD less $0.17		3/13 - 3/31	96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

I don't know what you're smokin up there, but every one of those deal numbers you listed are WRONG.  

Deal 633842 is valid for mtr 416.  It has a zero nom.  You can send that to POPS or path a volume to the deal and send it on.
I added the 15th-18th to deal 621598 for item (2).

Aimee

OK thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, Joanie received a call from Beaumont stating that there is a sale to HPL on 2/9 for 5,000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply  draft and Buddy Majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to HPL from Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/ all 02/01 prod. sales to HPL ? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?

My location is 3507f.   

Ok, thanks! Can I get a copy of your support so that I can fax to customer this a.m.?  Please let me know your location.

I still handle meter 1428.  I checked my notes for 2/13.  There was an intraday change from 18.000 to 0.  When it was changed to 0, the meter had already flowed 3.811.  It is a valid volume.  If you have anymore questions, please let me know.

Aimee  

Aimee -
Per conversation with Rosa Brown and Thu (In Volumes Management, Beaumont Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428.

Do you still handle the sales allocations for  HPL meter # 981428? If so, can you confirm 02-01 sales (on HPL, Meter # 981428., Sales Deal # 603107), to Beaumont Methanol (which we've invoiced them ), vs. Chyral Hankins' e-mial to buddy Majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02-13-01 (She reflects noms of 0 vs. the 3,811 mmbtu that we invoiced them).

Thanks,

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

Megan, 

I changed the demand fee for Jan.  It looks like Trisha has changed the Transport ticket for the $.11.  I agree with the header charges.

D

   

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

We do not have storage in a facility on PG&E.  But, we do use parking and lending agreements regularly.

D

   

We don't have storage on PG&E do we?  I think that is park and lend.  What do you think?  I have put together the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel.

Dave

Please provide the information requested below as soon as possible.  Improvement in this process will help minimize flash-to-actual variances. 

Has any progress been made on this?  So far, I have only received information on Cove Point.

We show that there is physical storage on the following pipelines:

CENTRAL -  Mid Continent, Moss Bluff, NGPL, and Reliant.
TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of physical storage between flash and the GL.  To that end, please provide the book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.

Done.

   

Please change the demand fee on deal 157288 for 8/00 from $9,575.45 to $6,143.64.  We need to reduce our payment to Duke.  When I adjusted the over delivery charge on the days we didn't nom,  the demand amount changed.  I waited until Duke agreed before I sent you this change.  

Thanks,
Megan

Can you come down to my desk around 1:00?

Do you have any time this afternoon or Monday to look at the Tenaska spreadsheet?  I am trying to close out Jan 2001 and I have some questions.

Megan

Julie, 

Howard comes from the volume management area, so I am sure that he knows the best way to handle the Shell buyback.  You should path the buyback that Howard set up.

D

Daren,
Howard set up the Shell meters to one buyback ticket - I haven't 
been pathing the shell meters. Before Aimee had it set up
individual and Howard said that it should all be tied to one.

Am I causing a problem by not pathing the meters now?
Should I go back and path the deal changes?
Thanks - Julie

ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, =

Ed and Lauri, 

Jill Zivley is needing bids on various wells from EEX.  I understand that anything that is captive to HPL will be going with the pipeline after the sale.  So, you should probably quote the bids for any of this supply.  I have listed the applicable wells and some limited info in the attached spreadsheet.  Eric Boyt is working on the structuring of the deal. He may be contacting   you. He would like to get the bids to Jill by Friday.  Let me know if you have any questions.

D

 

Jill wants a quote on the supply.  This can be given at the wellhead or at a liquid point (with EEX incurring the transport to get the gas to the liquid point.)

D

Does Jill want a transport quote on these wells or should I pass these wells for quoting to someone in supply?

I have attached a revised schedule of the EEX deal.  I have included our bid price and  additional notes for each field. If  you will re-print the quote sheets, I will enter our bids on them.  Additionally, since we are bidding to buy the gas delivered to the "liquid" areas, please make sure that our agreements with EEX state that the gas must be pipeline quality and must be able to be delivered into the pipes specified on the attached schedule.  Let me know if you have any questions.

D

Please view the tab labeled "Bid Pts by bid pt".

 

Cynthia,

$4.87 is the correct price for this deal. Waha did not trade above 4.94 on 3/23.  This is an EOL deal, so Conoco should be able to easily check their records to confirm this.

D

Daren, Conoco invoiced HPL at $5.87 for 03/23 at PGEV/Waha and deal ticket 685350 shows $4.87.  Can you confirm the price?  Thanks.

I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.

For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.

For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

Daren,

Is it okay to enter a wellhead deal in April for a purchase from HESCO at meter # 9885 priced at Gas Daily less $0.14 with a volume of 1,100/d?

Bob

Vance,

Deal tickets have been created and entered in Sitara as noted below.  Deal # 652448 was entered by Risk as a term purchase at a price of IFHSC less $0.14.  You have indicated the price to be Gas Daily less $0.14.  Which price is correct?

Bob

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:

Counterparty			Meter			Volumes	Deal #	Price				Period		Global No.
Comstock Oil &Gas			9872			500mmbtu/d	652448	100% GD less $0.20		3/30-3/31	96057106

HESCO Gathering Co., LLC		9885			1100mmbtu/d	733139	100% GD less $0.14		3/30-3/31	96058382
															4/01-4/30	96058382
	
FYI, we will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the appropiate month.  Additionally, these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

The contestants ain't got a chance!

A major network is planning the show "Survivor 2" this winter. In
response,
Texas is planning "Survivor: Texas Style." The contestants will
start in  Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio, over to
Houston,
and down to Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio, on to El Paso,
then to Midland/Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo. From there, they proceed to
Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.
Each will be driving a pink Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads, "I'm
gay,    I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."
The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

Rick, 

I've had a couple of meetings today.  I'm sorry I'm just getting back to you.  I tried to call but the voice mail said that you were unavailable.  So, give me a call when you get a chance.

D

I'll call you on Thursday...what's a good time?

Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

D

the deal with TGLO should be handled the same way in March.

Julie,

Deal 640685 for March 01 production:  per Daren Farmer (in the Audit field in Sitara), this was copied from deal #547201.  This deal is the Crude Swap where volume stayed but price got zeroed out and booked as a demand charge under 679847 and 679848.

Please confirm that it is the Crude Swap and rebook as necessary.

If you have any questions or need additional clarification, please let me or Katherine H. know.

Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.

547201 & 591307 has been zeroed out.  679847 & 679848 have been created between ENA & HPLC.  679859 has been created for the sale to EGM from ENA Wellhead.  I have placed both January and February on that deal.

If this will not work, please let me know.

Thanks!!

FYI-

Will the price be reversed on HPLC sale for Jan01 and Feb 01 prod?
Thanks- katherine

George - I've done some T-accounts (the bean counter in me) and I think the following is the best way to handle this going forward:
	
Change the existing deals, 547201 and 591307, to a zero price.  This will eliminate the A/R balance on HPL's books for GLO, but will keep the volume nom'd to GLO and will not impact UA4.
Enter a ticket on HPL for a sale to ENA for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets.  This should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $974,144 for 1/01 and $766,304 for 2/01.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book purchases the demand from HPL.  The amounts would be the same as in #2 above.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book sells demand to EGM for the value of the crude oil for the prior month.  For 1/01, the sale would be for $886,638.60 (the 12/00 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  For 2/01, the sale would be for $839,008.29 (the 1/01 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).

This will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward:
The price on the sale from HPL to GLO will need to be zeroed out monthly.
The demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out.
The demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to EGM.

Once this is done, the A/R balance for GLO will be cleared, the margin will be on the ENA Wellhead book, and the intercompany transactions will move the money from EGM to HPL.  This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances.  The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.  We should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ENA to EGM.  If you have any questions or see a better way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks.

We recently purchased house with a spa in the backyard. After filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels, the water smells like mildew.  Is there a way to treat this chemically?  I thought that the smell was coming from the cover at first. But, I have thoroughly cleaned the cover inside and out.  Could the smell be coming from the air/water lines?  It appears that the previous owners did not take care of some things around the house.

Thanks.

Rebecca, 

TXU is correct on the pricing.  I have adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.

D

Could you verify the pricing on TXU Gas Distribution deal #589007 for the following days?  

Sitara shows:
2/6 - 2/6		5,000 mmbtu @ 6.62
2/10 - 2/12	30,000 mmbtu @ KATY.HUB.GDP.D.A
		40,000 mmbtu @ WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A

TXU Gas paid based on:

2/10 - 2/12	40,000 mmbtu @ KATY.HUB.GDP.D.A
		50,000 mmbtu @ WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if this should go to someone else.

Rebecca

Ed, 

I believe that Jill was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale. We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized. The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and Jill was going to present them with bids for their total package (Enron and HPL).  Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.

D
Daren,

It is my understanding that Enron should not be attempting to purchase wellhead supply on HPL per the contract 

Bob, 

I have made a few adjustments to the wellhead file, with some comments. Please review the file and make the changes in Sitara today. Let me know if you have any questions or if something changes.  Thanks.

P.S. How do you like the shading?

 

That's no problem.

Daren,

Not to be picky, but this deal is in for 5322 and I confirmed 5323, do you mind if I up it one giant decatherm.  I need to so I can path in balance and prevent  errors on our reports.

Thanks.

That's fine.

Go ahead and adjust the deals to bring us in balance.  What is the daily flow for the Saxet well now?

D

In looking at  the MTD prod. vs. nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2,000/day at Three Rivers and 2,000/day at the Saxet well.  We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.

Since we have not heard back from legal let's use this phrase:  "The data on 
this disk is intended for the exclusive use of NREL and is not intended for 
further distribution."

HK

I think I have the formulas fixed in this one.

Tom,

Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used 
May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and 
gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). 
There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where 
the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 
100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC). 
Temperatures were as high as 366. 

If this format is acceptable let me know and I will generate graphs for the 
data we have (Jan - "current" 2002).

Mark

Tom,

The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you 
earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for 
June 2002 yet, and the data for Jan is nonexistant, so the graphs go from Feb 
to May 2002. 

If you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Andre,

Here is a short subset of 10-minute records containing the extreme 
temperature event (approximately 3 hours of before/after data). The turbine 
was #105 at Desert Sky on May 1st. Times are in UTC. The values are 10-minute 
averages.

If you have additional questions let me know.

Mark

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark

Tom,

Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 

I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
completed within the next couple of days.

If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.

Mark

Hi Mark,

The message at 10:47 says the the computer was rebooted at that time.  That 
is about the only way that I know of that this message would be recorded.

When the TrbCurtail Service is started it does not remember what turbines 
were curtailed.  It waits 10-minutes after starting before issuing any 
commands to calculate a 10-minute average.  After the 10 minute startup wait, 
the first command output from this program would have released all turbines 
that were currently curtailed, and curtailed new turbines as needed to keep 
the 10-minute average MW output at the curtailment setpoint.

So at 10:57 any turbines that were curtailed before that time would have been 
released.
The curtailment log file Visupro creates at the turbine should be able to 
verify this if needed
.

On a per turbine basis he would be expecting some to have big drops. However 
for the entire site, the amount we were talking about would be about .5% (for 
1 month). Though I don't know if he expected individual turbines to have more 
impact on the site average than they do . For 10 turbines having one drop 5% 
only lowers the site by .5%.

Kurt Anderson
07/10/2002 03:51 PM
If we are only talking about a .6% drop in avg. availability, we had better 
be ready to defend our numbers. Not just defend but convince Zilkha why we 
are right with our calcs. Mark F. unless I am mistaken, Gary V. is expecting 
a bigger drop??

Mark V Walker
07/10/2002 02:04 PM
Summary:
The Jan - May 2002 availabilities are revised to exclude virtual mode / pause 
events.   The results showed that every turbine had between one and two hours 
each month where the WTG was transitioning between states as per design.   
Therefore, the resulting total hours of pausing and virtual mode for each 
turbine was decreased by one and a half hours.   In addition the pausing due 
to noise curtailment at turbine 7 between the hours of 7 PM and 5 AM local 
time was excluded.   No other changes were made to the SCADA data.  The net 
result is that the Jan availability dropped by 1.5%, Feb dropped by 0.4%,  
Mar dropped by 0.3%,  Apr dropped by 0.1%.   Dec 2001 data was not corrected 
due becasue the data recovery of the minana files in that month was very 
poor.  The Somerset report  is  well underway and will be in a similar form.

We will be working this weekend to coreload as many machines as we possibly 
can.  Please send me your network and lotus notes password.  If we do not 
have your passwords, I will reset them to password.  We will start with the 
South facility, and if all goes well, proceed to the north.  Please leave 
your machine logged on.  NOTE:  If you are an Expedition user, we can not 
load your machine yet, as the current version of Expedition does not run 
properly on Windows 2000.  A new version of Expedition will be installed on 
July 8.

Tim,

In Oct 2001 I produced the attached reports for Michael Paine. I hope these 
are helpful. 

Mark

Jeff,

Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created. Mar & Apr 
wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines. May has gone up, possibly due 
to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be 
better this time. The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID. The 
"extras" are at the bottom with 0 production.

Mark

Tom, 

Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 
(may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each 
site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind 
deviation" faults.

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), 
which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. 
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.

I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Tom,

Here is the report I prepared on the methods and types of grpahs for this 
work request. As examples I used the May 2002 graphs, including the Paretos 
for the Pitch and overspeed faults. If you need additional clarification, or 
have questions let me know.

Mark

Tom, 

Maybe I mis-interpreted again, but here are the graphs for site total (the 
boxplots are still by turbine). This is for May. I will wait to see if this 
is more like what you need before continuing with the earlier months.

Mark

Tom,

Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) 
for all seven sites through May 2002. 

I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the 
ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 
10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have 
that result to you next week. 

Mark

Jeff,

The files are in DesertSkyCurtail in your transfer dirtectory. Check the sums 
of the KWH.LOST columns with the values you were provided. These all seem to 
have been created the same day.

Mark

Tom,

From the stage I was at on the duration and energy it was just as easy to do 
all 7 sites as the 3 you specifically requested. If you do not want the 
additional graphs let me know and I'll pull them out of the Acrobat file. 

Mark

hello Mark;

I need to get the following information for the 750 kw turbines, may be  from 
storm lake, lake benton 1&2  . We need these info's ASAP  , Please help !

currents all 3 phase if possible ( generator)
voltages all 3 phases if possible (generator
generator RPM, KW, generator temperature  1&2
generator rotor current ,voltage , frequency, any information the system is 
recording for the rotor I would like to get it.

Can we collect the above information over all the speed range of the 
generator since the turbine starts till maximum speed  ( 
hypersynchronous).above synchoronus

Thanks very much

Nagwa

Tom,

I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached. Graph 1 is site totals, graph 
2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is 
taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by 
turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost. 

The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with 
data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at 
Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the 
other sites. 

If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with 
the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this 
process to get you what you need.

Mark

Denise,

A couple of questions about software. 

I have used and would like to continue to use MiKTeX (A windows version of 
TeX, the technical typesetting program). I find it is useful for 
automatically formatting reports in fact I have designed the automated 
summary report for the turbine SPC report using this program. This is 
freeware. (The TeX users group http://www.tug.org/ has information of TeX 
implementations. MiKTeX is probably the best, but PCTeX by Personal TeX is a 
good non-free version). Please let me know what will need to be done so that 
I can continue to use this software.

I was also planning to start Syncing my PDA with Outlook (as soon as Outlook 
is configured for use). So can I install the "Palm" software for this purpose?

Leesa,

I just found out that I had volunteered to buy a table for the SPA luncheon on Thursday, October 11th so I am trying to fill it up with people.  Would you be interested in attending a luncheon at the Houston Country Club on October 11th?  Susan Murray will be there.  Pamela and Jaye will not be able to attend because they are going to be out of town.

Let me know.

Mary

If I can fit into it, I plan to wear one of my really nice suits.  This is the ladies who lunch crowd so you will see everything.  I'm so glad that you can go.

 Thanks, Mary.  I would love to go.  I have it on my calendar.  Let me know the appropriate dress.

Lynda,

I've researched the Arkansas request for an intial business registration booklet.  This is a new requirement and it needs to be included with the Annual Report.  

If you have any questions please let me know.

Mary

Peggy - I have not file any Oklahoma initial business registration booklet before.  I think it's should be handle by Income groups.  I only filed the initial Annual Report form, which asked for name of the Officers and Directors. 

Mary - Could you please check on your side has anyone file the initial business registration booklet in the past. Is it combine with Franchise Tax Return.

ps.- Today, my Department is packing boxes up for the moves to 3AC on Monday.  I will response to all your e-mails on next week because all the files and records are in the box.

Thanks!

Mary.  I have more information on the status of this entity with the state of Oklahoma.  The State did acknowledge receiving the documents for which you sent the evidence to me yesterday.  However, they indicate that the $15 reinstatement fee was not paid, nor was the initial business registration booklet filed.  We will remain suspended until those documents are filed.  

Lynda - I think that you might be the one who would handle the initial business registration booklet, but I am not sure.  If neither you nor Mary are the appropriate ones to contact about these matters, will you please advise who is.

It would also be a good idea that when those documents are ready to be filed that a copy of the cancelled check, front and back, that accompanied the documents you sent in August be attached with an explanatory cover letter so the state can put all the pieces back together.  If you would like to pass the completed documents through me for filing, I will be happy to take care of getting them to NRAI for filing.
If you believe that these documents have been filed and that we should be in good standing, you may want to contact the State directly at 405 521-3161. 
Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Anissa,

I can't thank you enough for the quick response.   We needed to get the Massachusett's return out this week.  Thanks again.

Mary

Please see the following break-out of the remaining balance of $16,263,807.21:  

MA	$12,685,769.62

RI	$3,578,037.59

Also, the interest income of $778,649 is all Ft. Hamilton - Long Island, NY.  No, this amount is not included in the $2,535,155.40.

My worksheet is attached for backup support.

Thanks,

AG

Annissa, thanks for the quick response.  I have one more request - will you please break-out the remaining balance of $16,263,807 into the amounts that should be apportioned to Virginia, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  Also, there is interest income of $778,649 reported on 34F.  Is this amount included in the $2,535,155 related to Ft. Hamilton?  If not, please provide me the break-out between states for the interest income as well.

Thanks!
Chad

Chad/Clint,

The total revenues for year 2000 on 34F was $18.798,962.61.  Only $2,535,155.40 is Ft. Hamilton in Long Island, NY.  The remaining balance of $16,263,807.21 pertains to GSA in Virginia/Rhode Island/Massachusetts.

If you need additional information, please contact me.

Thanks,

AG

Chad/Clint,

The amount of $18,798,962.61 given to you by Mark Adauto was incorrect.  It consisted of our 'entire 34F ledger' revenue + interest income.  The correct total is $2,535,155.40 which is all Ft. Hamilton in Long Island, NY.

Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,

AG

Anissa, we are trying to prepare the 2000 New York Franchise tax return for Enron Federal Solutions, Inc.  In order to complete this return, we need the sales in the state of New York apportioned to either the cities or counties that this income was derived in.  For 2000, there was a total of $18,798,963 of sales and interest income apportioned to the whole state of New York.  This is the amount we that we need broken out into cities or counties.  Clint and I have been requesting this information from you for several weeks now.  We need this by Friday, August 17 to timely file this return.  Please contact me with any questions.

Thank you
Chad

Rick,

I think that this company falls into your group now.  Sorry about passing the buck.  Would the tax department be responsible for registering a company to do business in a state?  Wouldn't corporate secretary be responsible for registering a company in a state?  Let me know how this turns out for future questions.

Mary

Point of clarification:  There are several business units that are adamant  in their position against registering for state income/franchise taxes; therefore we are instructed to register for sales/use taxes if we determine the need to do so.  The registering for income and other taxes will be determined and handled by each business unit.  When we do register for sales/use tax, we notify the respective business unit and then they can register for their purposes according to their position.
	-jtm

Mary - Are we talking regarding Oklahoma Initial business registration booklet?  I do agreed with you that for Arkansas do required to file the initial report and the Annual Report.

Peggy - I have confirmed with Jerry Moore re: Oklahoma Initial Business Registration booklet.  We, Transaction Tax Dept. are only responsible to file the section for Sales/Use Tax.  Each business unit is responsible to file their own report section.

Thanks!
Lynda X30602

Facundo:   See the note below.   Please note that you will need to reverse the book loss recorded on the upper tier entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn and Grizzley) for the purchase of the lower tier entities in the amount of about $600 million.   In place of the reversal of the book loss, you should record a tax Schedule M to deduct the same (about $600 million) of interest expense.   I am working with Essie to determine which entities will report how much of the $600 million purchase price.   Thanks, John.

FYI

Essie:

The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate "MARC" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures.  As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.

Each of the "top tier" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) "purchased" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the "bottom tier" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively).  Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000.  As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures).  

For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine).  The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument.  Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity.  For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil.  

We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books.  Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message.  

Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10.  Thanks!

I sent you and Sean an invitation to a party for Carl who is turning 60 on October 28th.  (I married a very very old man!)  I was hoping that you and Sean could stop by so I would have a familiar face there and since you live in the neighborhood.  The other guests are buddies of Carl, went to school with Carl, play tennis with Carl or worked at Pennzoil with Carl.  We have only been married seven years and I don't know these people that he has me inviting.

How are you doing?

Mary  

Leesa,

I wanted to confirm that I will be walking in the Heart walk on November 3rd.  I'm working on collecting those pledges.  I hoping that it is kosher to hit up family members for pledges.

Mary

I don't know if Carl is going to walk in American Heart Walk becuase of his knee problems, heaven forbid that walking would injure his knee so he couldn't play tennis.  You could probably talk him into walking, because he won't do it for me after seven years of marriage I have lost my influence/I'm officially taken for granted.

I will be walking this Saturday so lets meet at my house and drive over together.  

Thanks, Mary ... will you be joining us after the walk at my house?  Is Carl walking, too?  It's kosher to hit up family members (I've collected from my Mom and Lloyd's Mom), as long as they don't mind.

Are you going to walk this Saturday in "Race for the Cure"?  Do you want to head over there together?

Leesa

I just checked the SAP reports on Harrier I LLC, Grizzly I LLC, Pronghorn I LLC, Roadrunner I LLC that the total losses of $710,594,336 have not been booked in SAP for September.

Facundo:   Essie and I will confirm with Donette tomorrow, but for the time being, plan on reversing the $710 million book loss on the entities listed below (if you determine that they were in fact booked) and include Schedule M adjustments to deduct as interest expense the purchase price paid by Harrier $6 mill., Roadrunner and Grizzly $15 mill. each, and Pronghorn $1,000 for the lower tier entities purchased from LJM. 

We will confirm and let you know before noon tomorrow.   Thanks, John. 

I just talked to Ron Baker, who advised me that the total losses to be booked are $710,594,336 and they will be booked as follows:

Raptor I		Harrier I LLC		$406,326,409
Raptor II	Grizzly I LLC		$15,531,889
Raptor III	Pronghorn I LLC		$309,508,781
Raptor IV	Roadrunner I LLC	($20,772,742)

Please check SAP to see if the numbers have been booked before the close as Ron wasn't sure if they had been booked or not.

Essie

Per my conversation with Eloise Williams the proceeds of $138,475,829 were never recorded on 33R but were recorded on 33Q.  Since this is a sale of inventory I'm assuming that the gain will be ordinary and should be reduced by the tax basis in the credits of $104.8 million.

Mary, I'm not sure what accounting is doing.  The entry below is not complete.  For third quarter close company 33R received proceeds of $138,475,829 for SO2 credits.  The credits are held in inventory on company 33Q, the mark-to-market revenue for the SO2 is reported on 33R.

The attached workbook is my best guess of the tax basis in the credits ($104.8 million); the tax gain should be about $33.7 million.

Can you check with your accounting contacts for company 33R to get a complete picture of the accounting entries?

 << File: so2 inv1.xls >> 

The correct entry is a debit to 19999995 (Cash) and a credit to 45000000 (Revenue)

Jeff,

The SO2 entry was booked to the following accounts:

Debit to 19999995             $138,475,829.50
Credit to 20011000            $138,475,829.50

GOOD JOB!!!!!

I am currently responsible for the following companies:

20R
20Q
890
1572

In preparing our monthly tax accrual closing entries, I have noticed that the MTM activity on each of the above referenced companies does not roll between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.  There are PRM assets on each of the companies (except 20R) and there is unrealized revenue on each of the companies (except 1572).  However, the change in activity on the balance sheet does not equal the income that is recognized in the 4200-0000 account.  I have attached a spreadsheet detailing the B/S accounts that I am looking at, as well as the amounts booked in account 4200-0000 on each company.  There is a difference of 15,886,556 that I cannot explain.  For tax purposes, I am currently reversing the amounts related to the balance sheet accounts, but I need to know where the offset is for the 15,886,556 appearing on the income statement.

Please let me know if you have any information concerning this issue.  Thank you.

Please let me know if you have any information concerning this issue.  Thank you.

6:15 works for me.  The best way to get to my house from your house is go down Shepherd past 59 and make a right on Sunset Blvd and keep on going past Kirby and Buffalo Speedway and a couple of stop signs.  My house is on the right.  It has a witch out in the front.  The address is 3726 Sunset Blvd.

Are you still on for tomorrow?  

ok ... let me know what time to be at your house (and directions, again ... I'm bad at directions) ... and I will pick you up on Saturday.

Beth Apke said to get there really early because parking is a mess.  So if the walk starts at 7:30, perhaps I should pick you up around 6:15?

Leesa

I don't know if Carl is going to walk in American Heart Walk becuase of his knee problems, heaven forbid that walking would injure his knee so he couldn't play tennis.  You could probably talk him into walking, because he won't do it for me after seven years of marriage I have lost my influence/I'm officially taken for granted.

I will be walking this Saturday so lets meet at my house and drive over together.  

Thanks, Mary ... will you be joining us after the walk at my house?  Is Carl walking, too?  It's kosher to hit up family members (I've collected from my Mom and Lloyd's Mom), as long as they don't mind.

Are you going to walk this Saturday in "Race for the Cure"?  Do you want to head over there together?

Leesa

Leesa,

I wanted to confirm that I will be walking in the Heart walk on November 3rd.  I'm working on collecting those pledges.  I hoping that it is kosher to hit up family members for pledges.

Dana,

I was suppose to do this a week ago.  Daisy is a friend of mine and she couldn't beleive that out of all the people at Enron I knew who you were.  She wanted me to ask you for your address so that she and Kim (who used to work for you but I can't remember her last name) could invite your wife to Accessory Cafe party that they are having at Kim's house.  Daisy said that they tried to send an invitation to Accessory Cafe party that was held at Daisy's house but the invitation was returned.  They had some nice things so I recommend it.  If you want to call Daisy directly her number is:  713-975-0250.  

Its a small world.

Nicole,

After thinking about our conversation this morning I don't think that we are on the same page.  I am looking for a sale of S02 credits that were sold by 33R but were held in inventory on 33Q.

Eloise Williams sent an e-mail to Jeff Herrold saying that an entry was made to the following accounts on 33Q:

Debit to 1999995 	Cash				$138,475,829.50
Credit to 4500000	Other Commodity - Third Party	$138,475,829.50

My question is was the sale reclassed to 30R by the following entry:
33Q	Debit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany 	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50

33R	Debit to 20023000	Accts Rec/Payable Non Trade - Interco	$151,404,038.50
	Credit to 450160000	Financial Settlements - Intercompany	$151,404,038.50

If so what else makes up the $151,404,038.50?

My next question is what is the cost of  the inventory that went to cost of sales for the sale of $138,475,829.50 S02 credits?  What was the entry that recorded the amount into cost of sales?

If you could get back to me as soon as possible, I would greatly appreciate it.

Mary

Now Felicia- Don't tell me you were planning on being up here on SUnday!  Anydya next week works for me- except Friday.

You bet.  Let's just pick a day for next week. How about 10/21??

Works for me.  Lets  go someplace special since it is your birthday.

Okay so I looked at the wrong month.  How about 10/25 and we can celebrate my birthday.

Only comment that I have is good luck!

Mary

I thought I would forward this to you for any comments you may want to weigh in with.  Patty and I have already examined the potential changes to state apportionment and taxes based on 2000 numbers and determined there is little impact.  If 2002 is as big a loss year for the PBM group as 2001 is shaping up to be, there may be some NOL's that Limbach will utilize.  Let me know if you have any questions, concerns or comments.

Thanks
Rick

We are planning on merging the PBM group into Limbach Company.  However, I need to know from each of your departments what needs to be done, if anything, to accomplish this.  The plan is to continue using PBM, Marlin and MEPS as DBA's, but their financial information will consolidate into Limbach company's.  I assume that this may affect contracts, dissolution papers will need to be filed etc.  Please let me know what your individual department will need to do in order to facilitate this event.  Mike Angel will gather all necessary information on October 26 (or sooner if you have it) and continue to follow up on each unresolved matter until completion.  Please let me know if you know of any reason(s) that this merger cannot take place from your particular perspective.  Assuming their are no definite roadblocks, the merger will effectively take place on 1/2/02.

I've got to got to a meeting and won't be back til after lunch and then I will search for those e-mails and forward them to you.  I just want to let you know so you won't think that I forgot.

Mary

Good Luck!

I want you to know that I really enjoyed sleeping in especially when I heard the rain.  I kept thinking I could be out there but I'm so happy I'm not.

I can't get access to my lotus notes but IT support is working on it.

You and Facundo are finished; I'm not sure about anybody else.

Are we all through with the update back process?  Mary needs some confirmation.

Everyone,

This is just a friendly reminder to have someone from your respective groups let me know when everyone in your group is done with the state update back reports.  I've only heard from the "Management Entities" group.  

If you think I've missed someone from the Forum group who should be on this list, please feel free to forward this.

Your calculation looks correct to me.  The deferred tax variance is because current month's income has not been tax effected and has not been recorded in your deferred tax liability balance.  There was a big flucuation in mark to market income for Pronghorn in September.

At the Global Accounting Leadership Conference a few weeks ago, Rick Causey conducted a "group conversation" in which he discussed several topics that he knew would be of interest to the group and fielded questions from the group on a variety of topics.  All of this was done in a very informal setting, with a free flow of information between Rick and the participants.  The attendees agreed this was a very good forum for communication.

I would like to give the entire Tax department the same opportunity.  Rick has scheduled October 30th from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. in EB1701.  Since space is limited, please reserve a spot by contacting Bobbie Moody via email only.  If more people sign up than the room will comfortably hold, we will schedule an additional meeting(s).  (You will receive a confirmation or a notice that you will be given another opportunity to attend a future meeting.)  Preference will be given to those who did not attend the Global Accounting Leadership Conference, which means that few of the Senior Directors or above will be at the meeting if there is a sizeable response.

In addition, while Rick will be happy to take questions at the discussion, feel free to submit questions in advance to Bobbie, to Melissa Becker (VP Human Capital Management for Global Accounting), or directly to Rick.  Questions directed to Melissa or Bobbie will be compiled and sent without names to Rick.  Alternatively, you may deliver your questions in an envelope to Bobbie (EB1747), Melissa (EB1769) or Rick (EB5023).  All topics are fair game.

How was the 15th?  Was it crazy?  Did any last minute clients come in begging to have their returns filed?  

Enron is still operating eventhough the President quit and they had to bring back Ken Lay.  Ken gave a speech this morning telling employees yes the stock has gone down but he predicts that it will go back up.  I hope that it does.

I'm planning to be at Debbie's party.  It sounds like it will be alot of fun.

Hey I hear you might be going to DG's Halloween party!!!  I will be there
and I think Doug will be there too!   Long time no talk!  Hope all is well,
we really need to have dinner sometime in the near future!

How are things going at Enron?

xox,

Vera

p.s.  I still have your pressure washer.....I will bring it to the party or
just let you know when I drop it off at your house.

I hope that you are coming back out to Enron.  Nothing much happening here except the stock price is sinking like a rock.  Ken Lay spoke to the employees this morning trying to raise the spirit.  He said don't panic, it will get better.  Let me know if you are going to be out here and lets do lunch.

Hi, Mary -

Well, I am no longer at Plains, and I am now back in the office.  I went
over to Duke (Galleria) for about 3 weeks - it was really great.  I am
suppose to be going out to Enron next week, but who knows.  What's
happening over there or as we like to say "down the street"?  If I do get
out there, let's try to do lunch.  I'll keep you inform of my schedule.

Bye,
Edna

Thanks,

I have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.

18T - EI Indonesia Operations LLC
	This entity is not in TIS, SAP, nor Hyperion.  The 2000 tax return has no income, assets, or liabilities.  There is a corporate data sheet for this company, but this entity seems to have been inactive since it's creation.

86M - Enron Net Works LLC
	Despite the name, this entity appears to be a MTM company.  Per September financials, this company has about $3M of MTM and about $8K of expenses, nothing else.

The next 5 companies were my responsibility while in EBS, and did not get assigned during the reorg.

80Y - Enron Broadband Acquisition, Inc.
	This entity was created in 2000 for the acquistion of WarpSpeed Communications (now Enron WarpSpeed Services, Inc. 83N), and then dissolved upon completion of merger.  Company is around with a small amount of assets and liabilities, but no I/S items.  83N is my responsibility.
	I think this entity should stay with 83N.  So I suggest it be assigned to Leon.  It should be 4 - easy.

1579 - EBS Network Co.
	Division of 17H.  This one should possibly be assigned to Networks & Services group.  Not currently on our list of companies.
	I think this could go to either Holding/Administrative Companies (Same as 17H) or Network & Services (Leon).  4 - easy.

1691 - EPI-EBS Europe
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1179.
	A similar entity (1179) was assigned to Commodity and Trade (Todd Richards and Mary Fischer) so this one should be assigned to them as well.  4 - easy.

1307 - EBIC-Apache, LLC
	Rolls up to Cherokee Finance VOF, a CFC.
	Cherokee Finance VOF is assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  Maybe this one should also go to them as the only tax which may have to be provided would be foreign tax.  4 - easy.

1689 - EPI-EBS Ventures, LLC
	Set up last month to centralize merchant asset activities.  Broke out the activities of 1307.
	Same as 1307.  It should be assigned to North America (Glen Walloch and Kevin Walker).  4 - easy.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Those dates work for me.

Mary,  I have eight companies that are ranked as 3's.  Below are the dates I have tentatively marked down for CB meetings.  Since you are the only required attendee, I have not reserved meeting rooms at this point.  I think all the 17th floor rooms are pretty well booked anyway.  I was thinking we could meet in your cube to discuss these companies on the given dates.  

Company #		Date

551			11/14
1572			11/19 (this is the same day as company 20R.  we might be able to do them at the same time)
47E			11/20
890			11/26
986			11/29
1095			12/5

003 			12/13 (these are both divisions of 367)
1700			12/13  

In addition to these companies, I have the following tentative dates planned for my 4's:

Company #		Date

1573			11/26 (the same day as 890.  both are divisions of 985)

1407			11/28

1650			12/18 (these are all the same type of company, and do not have much activity at all)
1688			12/18
1690			12/18
1691			12/18
1699			12/18

Let me know your thoughts/availability for these dates.  I figure we can plan a time around when you are free on each specific day.  

Yes; I think orginally Patty thought that the permanent differences per the return would all be considered timing differences, but after discussion with accounting the amount of permanent differences that could be recatorgized to timing was a net change of (14,000,034).  

Thanks for catching my huge blunder.

Mary

When I put the changes in TIS, the total RTA changes from (8,562,517) to (13,717,606).  The change of (5.1) million is not what Robbie passed along to me as the expected change.  Do those numbers sound correct?

Thanks,

Michelle,
Facundo is going to need his companies unlocked because an OTP was not created for any of the companies that he is now responsible for.

Thanks,
Mary

The attached query lists companies that used plugs in TIS Period 0012 to correct income on their returns.  These plugs to income do not pull thru to the Management Summary Report or Provision Window in TIS, and thus the plugged income is not included in the Period 0012 tax calculations.  

To correct Period 0012 taxes in TIS, you must manually calculate the taxes related to the missing income in TIS and create an OTP (M Class Code 431 100 100/105 for CFIT, and 431 100 120/125 for CSIT) in Period 0012.  Do not include the federal benefit on state taxes when calculating your Federal OTP.  TIS will calculate the benefit on the State OTP automatically.  The OTP's should have already been done when the return was completed and the RTA was analyzed.  Please contact me if you still need to make these entries, and we will get these companies unlocked in 0012.  

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Hello,  George.
1.   The actual shift change occurs at 6 am until further,  however,  I expect traders to arrive at least 20 minutes before shift change.
2  the September work schedule is attached
3.  I understand that most park in daily fee, "outside" lots.

Thanks,
JMF 

John, 

Good morning.  Just wanted to pose a couple of questions that I was thinking about this weekend.  First, does the shift begin at 5:30or 6?  I know you had mentioned that you may change the hours.  If you know, what is the general consensus for those  individuals working night and days, as far as parking is concerned. Lastly, please forward me the September schedule when you get a chance?   

Thanks John, I'm looking forward to coming up!!!  George 

Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline".  
   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.

Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.

His reply is as follows:

Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.
Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.
If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.

We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   
The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.

This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly"  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.

Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:

If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.

If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:

$50 premium for OOM up.
$10 premium for OOM down.

These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.

If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.

Please call me if you have questions,

Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:

For every counterparty "Ercot Imbalance" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to "off"  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.

What do you think?

JForney

kim,  
thanks so much for checking into this for me.   sorry for the delay in submitting.

JMF

Please authorize an extension for Mr. Forney's relo expenses as per the note below.

Kim and John,
The benefits can be extended if they are expired.  If they are expired, all we would need is an email from HR stating the approval to extend.  John, contact your consultant, Cami Mursch at (800) 241-6529 and she will assist you in getting the expenses processed.
Thanks,
Deborah 3-1426

Debra, can you advise?

Kim,
I had mentioned that I had not completed submitting my expense for temporary housing,  etc.    I mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year.
Can I still get this in?   I think I have everything in order.

Thanks,
JMF

So,  you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?   Good call there.
I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.    Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap,  $165.       The weather was awesome and the wine was good 
(  as far as I can remember ).    
Anyway,  it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.    

What are you working on here,  is it classified?

JMF

yep,  coffee is a good idea.

jmf

I tried calling you last week and heard you were out.

I am in Houston until mid-Feb and then who nows.....  do you want to catch-up for a coffee some time this week?

Hey,  melon-boy -

Who would I talk to about the residential customers.    I received a call from a load aggregating company that specializes in residential sign ups.
This sounds like a good idea, provided that our strategy hasnt changed.

Whatup?

JMF

What about New Power,  should we refer this deal to them?   It looks pretty good.

fornicatio

Fornicator,

We have a non-compete with New Power, so we can not serve residential load.  It would be a good idea, but we can't do it.  Unless your brilliance can find a way around the non-compete.

Do you have any record of this deal?   I should that you worked this day.     
If this exists in your personal trade log,  then we need to Enpower this.

Let me know what you find.

Boy:

the deal number for the coa option for tomorrow is 765595.1.  do you need this????

JMF

Due to Oklaunion being down  for maintenance,    we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #570719.     This 25 mw purchase from Tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 23 and 24 today.     Buy the power tonight  and enter deal under Ercot Mgmt book, as this is Doug's power.
I have already made the cuts in Enpower for both hours ending 23,24 and tomorrow.

For tomorrow,  I have purchased energy for this schedule,  so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis.

If you have questions,  let me know.

Thanks,
JMF

Alex,
You have been somehow  entering deals under South America - Brazil region,   rather than South 2001.   Risk has been having a problem with this.
This has also affected the Brazil trading desk.      
Double check your deal entry desks and zones.     I intended to mention this last week and I forgot.   It came up again today,  per risk.

Also,
on the hour ending 6 deal today;   you should have entered a sale to Frontera in Enpower, rather than Mirant.
This is a bit confusing,  but here goes:

Frontera had sold Mirant this option,  not Enron.     Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for.   I replace this power,  or Frontera generates the schedule.
If I (or you)  replace,  then we do enter a schedule of a sale to Mirant in the Portal.   But,  we dont sell to Mirant in Enpower, as this is not our deal.

Instead,   the sale goes to Frontera.   They pay us to reimburse us for buying LCRA on their behalf. 

Does that help?

JMF

Kim,
Cammi Mursch has asked for an e-mail from Enron authorizing an extension.
Can we do this?

Thanks,

can you give me the info for a New Power contact?

jmf

Anoush, 
I have talked with John Phillips with Cinergy Worldwide.    His company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the Northeast.  They are not related to the Cinergy utility.      They are interested in a partnership with Enron/New Power where Cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper/ terms in return for a negotiated fee.
He is interested in entering the Texas Choice arena.     They claim to be capable of size in signups.

I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP. 
The number for  John Phillips is :   410-365-5613

Let me know what your thoughts are.

The Oklaunion plant is offline until midnight Friday.    I have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market.   
No replacement is needed.
Also;
You will notice that from peak on through 24, the pool has been strong.     Generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day.
You can recognize this in the ACE display on the monitor.   Notice hour ending 3,4,5.   Theyre draggin.
Prices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on.

JMF

Mr. Hinson,
Sorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.

There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.     

I know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........

Thanks and give me a call if you need more info,

Madhup,
We have been having alot of trouble with one of the big screens that is fed by the portal server.      It is the display over Doug's head.    This shows ACE and load forecast.

Doug is very excited about this,  as we have had a daily problem   It works temporarily ,  but goes down daily.

Is Sasha the guy to talk to on this?

The Hourly Ercot book is long 30 mw's  at $13.25 for hour ending 23 and 24 on Friday.    This is currently scheduled into the North Zone load.
When you sell this,   cut the load and replace with the appropriate QSE trade.

The purchase is in Enpower as #825387.  The sale to Ercot Imbal is under #825406.        Cut the enpower sale and replace with appropiate sale counterparty.
Everything should be entered under the Hourly Ercot desk.

Let me know how it goes.

Tom,
The Frontera file has, in the first tab,   their calculation for their daily costing.
Ken gave me this and asked me what I think.    It would probably be best if we talk some more about it,  rather than sending it to Jerry Brown,  etc.

What do you think?

JMF 

The ST ercot book is long 30 mw's in the offpeak hours for Monday.    We would like to sell these mw's at a reasonable price that is left to your judgement.
If prices look to be potentially negative,  of course,  sell the mw's.

Give me a call if you have questions, preferrably before 10 pm.

Thanks,

The Resolution desk has given me the password.   However,  George was not set up in deal blotter under North America,  East Region.   I have since submitted another E-request for George.   The reason is,   he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name.
Can you watch out for this?

	One more thing I neglected to mention.  Deal Blotter only refreshed lookups once per day, the first time it is run.  After that, you must do it manually.  When Deal Blotter comes up, you will see that one of the main menu items is "Refresh."  Choose Refresh, Lookups, All and the lookups will be refreshed.  That should solve the problem.  Sorry for not mentioning that earlier.

Frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below.      I have sold them this imbalance for $28.57.    Any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below.

hour ending 7 - 320
he 8 -320
he 9 - 320
he 10 - 215
he 11 - 150
he 12 - 50 

The total is 1375.   This is the equivalent of a financial swap,  but the settlement will remain intact.

Thanks,
JMF

Ken,  
Take a look at this.   We will sell an additional 85mw's for hour ending 2300 tomorrow.    This is not on the sheet, obviously.

Thanks,
JMF

 

Frontera has scheduled the following for tomorrow:

he 7-11,   350 mw's
he 12-22,  400 mw's
he 23, 50 mw's 

We will be required to sell an additional 85 mw's tomorrow for hour ending 23 in order to get up to the minimum run of 135mw's.
If Frontera has problems coming up tomorrow,  there may be an ACE issue.  

We will advise.

JMF

I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).  
I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North.
I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.

Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.

If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.

Words of advice:

Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.

Thanks,
JMF    

Karen,
I have spoken with Adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process.    At that time,   I had left messages with all three candidates,  but was unable to reach them.
Late yesterday afternoon,  I received a call from Nicholas Watson.   
I was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background.    He also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at JP Morgan Chase & Co.

I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview.   I did relay to him that we would contact him within a week.

I will again call the other candidates.

JMF

John/John/Frank

As we are approaching the November 1st Trading Track interview dates, we need to finalize the reminder of the external candidate's initial screen.

Thanks,

I have spoken with Ruben this morning.    He is currently working in Structuring for Sempra,  focusing on the Ercot retail market.    Additionally,  he has worked for the California PX.    This and his educational background would have me recommend scheduling an interview with this applicant.

JFORNEY

thanks,   tell these guys to trade it up!

John,

Your new daily swap seems to be generating a lot of interest. I've gotten calls from friends at both Reliant and Dynegy in the last 24 hours about it. 

Good job. 

http://mospublic.ercot.com/ercot/jsp/balancing_services_mcp.jsp

This is the public Ercot ISO site.    You can query for prices.    We have an internal site,  the East Power Portal site,  which has a section for Price and Load. 
This scrapes info from the Ercot website.   I would think that you need special access to use the link below.

http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=35&url=/portal/modules/regions/ercot/priceload.aspx

JMF

A reminder,   I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.   This has been scheduled into the North Zone.    If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.   Enpwr deal   834600   is the sale to North Zone.

The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's  for the offpeak hours at $9.20.   The  Enpwr deal number is #836534
If you sell hours 1-6,  cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.    We will leave

Additionally,   Frontera needs to sell the following:

hour ending 4 - 30 mw's
he 5 - 30 mws
he 6 - 85 mw's
Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.

I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).    I then pay the pool price.    If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours,  please cover and schedule to the South Zone

The Swap went very well today,  since we had a physical position:

Although the physical may lose $1500,  the financial swap will make $17,000.

Here's how it works:
When you buy balday,   you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool)
Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.     

The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.

Call if you have questions.
JMF

i have zeroed this price out.   thanks

jmf

JMF,

Heads up for you on ERCOT-Imbalance deal 835169.1 from 10/24/01 had a price associated with it, I have zeroed out this out but thought you needed to know.

Thanks,

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.

The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

JMF

 

I am discussing this with Cara at Tenaska.   She is going to send more support for this.

Sell hour ending 6 only- 30 mw's for Frontera tomorrow.   DO NOT GO TO THE POOL .
If you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price ($0 or greater) and the pool appears to be going to a negative,   call Jerry and wake him up.   Have him ramp up starting he 7.
Try to sell tonite if possible,  so we wont have to wake them up.

I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow.

They will be short the following hours:

he 7 - 370
he 8 - 265
he 9 - 200
he 10 - 50

I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.   I sell fixed and buy floating.       If you think that the pool will be high,  then you buy fixed and take to the pool.
You will buy fixed and sell floating.    Net,  we are left with two fixed prices.  Very cool.

Ercot will be calling due to the ACE issue.   The plant will be coming up slowly.

Frontera is scheduled to generate a total of 400 mw's onpeak.    There may be an ace issue for hours ending 7-10.   We suspect that Ercot will want us to stay down due to price/lack of load.
Check with Real Time trader.

Thanks,.

Please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction,   we will also receive a category one deployment.
The unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce.    The category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level.   These should not be combined .

Also,  when you receive a category 2, 3 or 4 we are essentially receiving an OOM type instruction that is settled under the OOM provisions.    

JMF

Jeff,
If you've rec'd a deployment instruction that is a Category 2,3  or 4, it implies the deployment is to relieve operational, or local, CONG.   The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch algorithm has determined your unit is  located such that its movement per the instructions will help to alleviate the  local congestion.  Following is copied from the document, "Market  Bulletin-Thursday August 8, 2001".  This is the last paragraph on page 2 of  that document.
"Therefore, when Operational  Congestion exists, the solution found in STEP 1 may be augmented in STEP 2 with  both resource specific and modified portfolio awards. The result of STEP 2 is  always a set of final portfolio based and resource specific dispatch  instructions to be issued to the QSEs to solve the operational congestion.  Because the final portfolio based dispatch instruction equals the net result of  the preliminary STEP 1 portfolio based balancing energy awards and any STEP 2  portfolio adjustments, the QSE's bid curve may not match the MCPE  determined in STEP 1. This may be causing the appearance of being incorrectly  "struck". Whenever a QSE receives unit specific deployments, it will  also receive a Category 1 portfolio based deployment. ERCOT expects that the  portfolio-based instruction will be followed."
So, even though your customer is determining your bids, your  unit could be called upon to relieve any local Cong that results from "Step 1"  (per the referenced bulletin) deployments to resolve load/gen imbalances and  zonal cong, if that unit is deemed to have an effect (the shift factor) on  the constrained line.  
 
Clear as mud?  Hope this  helps.  
 
I'm leaving here in about five minutes to go to an appt with  Holly, but will be back in on Monday.  
 
Regards,
 
Brett  
 

Yes,  Joe Capasso does report to me.

Thanks,
JMF

Can you confirm that Capasso, Joe works in your group so i can give them access to the portal

Thanks for the info for the additional load.      As I understand it,  we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.  This is great!!
Each day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.

I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.

Do we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page.
Let me know what you think.

JMF

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.

The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

JMF

 

I will be attending a funeral tomorrow,  but I am available to meet on Tuesday.    Thank you for checking back with me.

JMF

it's a power thang.....

JMF

Thanks,
JMF

JMF

Stewie,
How is it going with baby Wolf?   I want to make sure everything is ok before I call him.        Done any good deals lately?
At least tell me about hiking.

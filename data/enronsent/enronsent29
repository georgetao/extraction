swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a 
flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning 
on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.    

I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than 
the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty 
intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably 
go.

Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns' schedule
for comparison.

          Gators              Longhorns
Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas

Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was a 
lot
of fun.

So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.

I will check with my bro, to see if he is interested and let you know.  Get 
some sleep.   Talk at ya later.

Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from 
you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down 
to Cabo for good.

Craig,  Attached is a short outline concerning the approach we discussed 
earlier.  Please review and let me know if you agree.

Hi Katie,  Remember me.  Not sure if this is still your email address, but 
thought I would check and see.  Hope you are doing well and school is going 
well.  If you are still out there drop me a line!

Hi Mom,   Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I have just been 
pretty busy at work and on the weekends.  Seems like there is not enough 
hours in the day.  I did go down to Cabo for a week.  It was a blast.  We 
partied way too much.  Everything else is going fine.  My roommate moved in 
at the beginning of September.  So far so good.   

Hope everything is going well down in CC.  Love yall and talk to you later.

What's new going on.
                   Talked to Sharon since they got back from their

Generally, I agree with the comments in your memo.  As it emphasizes, the
factors that will ultimately shape this dispute and its outcome are the
facts.  What we really need now is to get a better handle on what effects
moving the Entrada/Dakota production to Badger Wash will have on Wildhorse,
and what Wildhorse  will say in response to Crescendo's proposal.

Might try this for the bar, while at the bar.

A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And
when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back
that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,
because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the
same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as slowest brain
cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but
naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way,
regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cell making the
brain a faster and more efficient machine.

And that's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.

To All:

After speaking to Bill, we are giving approval to this second transaction 
between JM Huber and ENA with the condition that the assignment of transport 
capacity is taken on by JM for BOTH transactions as previously discussed, and 
I initial this contract which clearly states this assignment of capacity.  It 
was our assumption, in Credit, that this initial transaction with JM was to 
include the assignment of capacity, which lead to a re-evaluation of the 
credit reserve.  It is imperative now, that once the contract and 
transactions are executed, they be re-confirmed in TAGG to more accurately 
reflect the exposure of JM

Paul,  We need to plan on getting together sometime.  When and how long are 
you going to be in San Diego once you get back from stomping out the "angry 
red horde"?  Might be an opportune time to hook up.  I would love to see Papa 
Bieraugel in action and I'm not referring to your Dad.

   

Gerald, things are cool here in Newport.  Filling up with tourists...just
like Corpus.  I'm getting ready to bolt for Virginia in about a month.
After that I'm off to the Gulf for four months then baCK TO SAN DIEGO.  TAKE
CARE...HI TO LISA.  pAUL.

Attached is a clean and redlined copy.  Mark,  Please note Russell Diamond 
with credit wants to initial these contracts before credit will approve the 
transaction from ENA's side.  I will send him the latest drafts.

Attached is the latest drafts.  These went to Huber for execution this 
afternoon

Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town 
for awhile.  

Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we 
get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.  

I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado 
in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I 
spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool.  
The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think 
it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley 
Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the 
inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception 
though.  

I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days 
down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and 
dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about 
being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying 
till 4 am and sleeping til noon.  

Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the 
pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter.  
Can't wait .

I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses 
that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I 
probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so 
much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get 
through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought 
you were going to graduate in December.  

It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when 
you get a chance.

Gerald

Hi Dee,

I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with 
you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer 
for yall.

I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we 
closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become 
somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward 
those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo.

Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They 
won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I 
wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as 
much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they 
can lowball you on the cash.

Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take 
care and talk to you later.

Hi Gerald,

I am still here!  Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.....  My brother's 
baby passed away from SID's the week I got back from Cabo and so we have been 
dealing with the funeral and all of the emotions that go with losing 
someone.  I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby.... So 
needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so very 
much behind!

Good news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week!  
That way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep 
forgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to you 
by Tues.

How is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your 
social life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!!   
I am sure that one day you will balance everything out...

Well it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also 
Friday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in a 
couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...

Have a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!

Take Care,

Dee

Sounds like your little cousin is continuing to strike out on the airline

The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like 
you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the 
candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and 
shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe 
since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.

Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but 
I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over 
with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty 
horrible this year.

Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this 
weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and 
I'll talk to you later.

I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our 
request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their 
obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period 
prior to the effect date of the agreement.  

Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your 
discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his 
notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.

Gentlemen,

Please see the attached production report - note the comment under
"DOWNTIME" at the end of the report.  It indicates Wildhorse pulled out a
compressor last week at the San Arroyo Plant and our pressures have
increased.   We are trying to get more information and will pass it along
when we get it.

We are still having high line pressures.

I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to 
me on a few things.

1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual 
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo 
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries 
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some 
capacity into NWPL.

2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that 
"the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other 
systems other than the Mesa system".  In addition he stated that we do not 
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.

3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current 
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out".  I reiterated 
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will 
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another 
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try 
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on 
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is 
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.

We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the 
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most 
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the 
existing contract.

I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to "let the lawyers 
fight over the existing contract" or work on a new deal for all the 
production.

P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture.

Mark

Liz Orr with Wildhorse just called to inform me we cannot nominate into 
NWPL.   Her legal department has informed her there are issues with the 
contract and until they inform her otherwise, our gas can only flow into 
Questar.   Physically, we can flow into NWPL but contractully we cannot.

We have changed the nominations back to Questar for tomorrow's gas day.

Sorry about that, (we tried)

may

Bob Mustard from Tom Brown called me at 5:00 today to inquire as to my 
understanding of the Wildhorse/Crescendo issues.  I explained to him the 
situation in a nutshell and he told me that they thought they would have 
completed the acquisition this week but should be finished next week.  He 
asked if we were still interested in acquiring the Mesa system and I told him 
that I thought we were interested in the gathering system and potentially 
theTom Brown  reserves.  He said they are very interested in talking to us 
about a deal on these properties and will forward a Confidentiality Agreement 
to me tomorrow.  

He also mentioned that there is a conference call tommorow at 11:00 A.M. 
central time between Crescendo and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse has asked that Tom 
Dyk and Pete Schere (Tom Brown execs) participate in that conference call.  
Tom and Pete are not comfortable participating in that call given the 
situation at hand.  Therefore, he asked if we could have Ken Krisa or someone 
else postpone the meeting.

Let's Discuss at your earliest possible convenience.

Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.  Please note the 
italicized sections of the CSA.  I am not sure what the terms quoted to 
Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to 
energy pricing.  We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.  Please 
review and let me know if you have any questions.

The form of right of way looks good.  Go ahead and forward to the land owner.

Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my 
revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded 
earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal 
Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.

This awesome picture was taken in Bitteroot National Forest in Montana on
August 6, 2000.  The photographer, John McColgan, is a fire behavior analyst
from Fairbanks, Alaska.  He took the picture with a digital camera.  Because
he was working at the time he took the picture he cannot profit from it;
however, we feel the picture is a once-in-a-lifetime shot and should be
shared.

Horoscopes 
? 

By Lloyd Schumner Sr.
Retired Machinist and A.A.P.B.-Certified Astrologer 

? 
? 

Aries: (March 21--April 19) 
After enduring the false smiles and empty promises of the business world for 
22 years, you'll appreciate the candor of the DEA agents assigned to you. 

Taurus: (April. 20--May 20) 
It seems like another sleepy day around your house. Unless, of course, you 
live at 332 Pheasant Drive in Yuma, AZ. 

Gemini: (May 21--June 21) 
You've lost your enthusiasm, but you're unsure if it was "damped" or 
"dampened." 

Cancer: (June 22--July 22) 
Cancer would like to take this opportunity to point out that it was right 
about the unrest in Yugoslavia. 

Leo: (July 23--Aug. 22) 
Though you've been telling everyone that you "went down on a boatload of 
sailors," the aircraft carrier Nimitz is actually a "ship."

Virgo: (Aug. 23--Sept. 22) 
You will make religious and scientific history when you develop a machine 
that converts standard English measurements to Islam.
? 
Libra: (Sept. 23--Oct. 23) 
While it's true that life is not a movie, many of your problems will be 
solved when the Army destroys the giant lizard 10 minutes before the end. 

Scorpio: (Oct. 24--Nov. 21) 
Things have certainly changed for you during these last few years. For one 
thing, eating a complete breakfast is now more important than ever. 

Sagittarius: (Nov. 22--Dec. 21) 
You will be hailed as a Catholic genius when you invent a new rhythm that's 
45 percent effective in preventing non-predestined pregnancies. 

Capricorn: (Dec. 22--Jan. 19) 
You will be one step closer to perfection when famed Italian engineer Massimo 
Bordi redesigns you for better airflow and optimal fuel atomization. 

Aquarius: (Jan. 20--Feb. 18) 
Wednesday will provide those who know you a perfect opportunity to marvel 
about how right Dante was about the fate of moneylenders. 

Pisces: (Feb. 19--March 20) 
The stars indicate success for you, but they do so with enough ambiguity to 
cover any possible alternatives.

Did you take the LSAT and kick its butt already?  I thought you were 
scheduled to take that recently.  You are probably wishing you have more 
stuff to study on the weekends.   

I am forwarding these to you with the condition that you are not allowed to 
send these to any of your uppity OU cronies.

Hendon,

I don't know what to say.  You sounded so official with that email.  How long 
did it take you to write it?

I'd like to make an announcement.  Hendon has become funny in my absence.  
Funny ha-ha.

I hope you got a good deal on my wine table.

I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever
floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in
the confines of your own mind  : )

Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had
squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney,
remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue
013 from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes
all possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and
Yankees have no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas."

Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at
the game.

GT,  How is it going?  Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took 
from OU.  Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.  

I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.  I might have my brother 
and another friend with me.  How are you set for space.  Those guys could 
crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.  If it is a problem, 
just let me know and we can make other arrangements.  

Talk at ya later

Hi Katie,  You guys would love Cozumel.  Short flight, very cheap, and lots 
of fun.  If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the 
world.  I had a blast down there.

Hope your Stats. class is going OK.  Unfortunately, I think that is one of 
those classes the just requires more effort than most classes. 

Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.  However, I know that will change as 
we get closer to the end of the year.  I do have a trip to Spain planned for 
November.  Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.  We 
are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.  Other than that 
we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.  I am really 
looking forward to it.  

Hope everything else is going well for you.  Are you sure you don't want to 
go for your Phd once you graduate.      : -)

Was curious if you heard anything further on this?  I haven't called again.  
Debating whether I should.

Any plans to go up to Estes anytime soon?

Things are going good in legal.  I am getting to work on some interesting 
stuff.  I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.  It 
was an asset and finance deal.  I got to work with the finance commercial and 
legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.  It is hard to keep 
up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of 
knowledge at this point.  Tense but fun.  

I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.  I heard Babers and 
Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.  Sounds like they 
were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them 
down.  At least that most other peoples opinion.  Sounds like Kenny Hayter 
look pretty good.  Leading Texas rusher.  He sounds like a power runner not a 
real juker.  

I am really worried about the NC State game.  It would suck to lose the home 
opener, but I think that is a very real possibility.  Their quarterback 
sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA.  I still think 
we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case.  Your right though.   If we 
fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building.  
I just don't think that will happen.  Mack is too smart and can really get 
these kids to overchieve.  I think his players believe and are motivated to 
play hard.  Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like 
James Brown.  When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is 
really going to pay dividends in the long run.  Mack Brown and Greg Davis 
weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC.  But Mackovic 
had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg 
picked right up on.  Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson 
wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone.  I like it.  It is going 
to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting.

I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any 
areas to go.  I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and 
know he is looking work people.  I don't know if this was the same stuff you 
did in Denver or the same group.   Might be.  Those guys do work a lot of 
hours.  Almost as bad as attorneys.  I will give it some thought.

Well, all for now.  Keep in touch.  I am glad you are going to be back in 
Houston.  We will have some fun.  I want to hear all about how much you 
really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.

Kay,  Please see the attached.  Thanks.

Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.  My only comment right 
now is that the correct name of the pipeline is "Houston Pipe Line Company". 
Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be 
getting back with you on the site access agreement.

Mark,  Attached are riders to be added to the CIG  Confidentiality 
Agreement.  Please forward these for review to the proper persons at 
Coastal.  Let me know if you have any questions.

We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if 
Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to 
Questar solely to mitigate damages.  I can draft the appropriate letter.

Joan or Ken,

Will the nominations be done via the web site?  Do we have the information to 
nominate to NWPL via the website?

What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through
the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate
on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement
that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal?

Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get
their late last Friday.

I Love You!

Audrey,  Attached is a term sheet that Barbara Gray prepared some time back

you.  About 2:00 pm.

Gerald-

I have the Lost Creek Members Meeting tomorrow.  What's your schedule later 
in the week?  Are we busy people, or what?

Take Care,

Audrey

Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail 
our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter 
such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that 
Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, 
we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages.  
Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it 
there.

From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our 
protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause 
problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing 
to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.   

	"Ken" <kckrisa@apex2000.net>
	10/23/2000 02:37 PM
	Please respond to kckrisa
		 
Joan, Gerald:
I am wondering whether we need to send another letter as we did for the
October Nominations - to continue to show our intent to nominate 100% of gas
to NWPL.  I think this may take some more thought - as I don't want to be
given the nomination and then curtailed 50% as other producers are.

Ken

The noms can only be done via the internet if we have a Wildhorse/NWPL
transport contract number.  And as far as I know, they still will not give
us one.  So, we can either : 1) obtain the Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number from Tom Brown and nom via the internet to NWPL; 2) if not,
nom via internet into Questar and fax letter; or 3) fax nom to Questar,
along with letter.

Mark - what do you think our chances of getting a Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number are?

Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to

Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is 
Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House 
prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice 
House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.

Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called 
Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other 
bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm.

Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are 
about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If 
you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let 
me know.

Hi.  I'm trying to be organized and thought I'd check in to see if you guys 
are around this weekend.  If you want to try and meet out, Anne and I are 
"lookin' for a good time".  

No acid rock, just good easy listening tunes.  Fastball had the hit about 2 
years ago called The Way.  Toadies; they just rock.  We will probably dress 
as under-appreciated, under-paid and fairly disinterested attorneys.

	Janel Guerrero@ENRON

One of the trading desks is ready to support a new product on EOL for 
transportation capacity.  This should be a very simple product.  At this 
point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all.  The 
product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at 
all on the front screen.  We will explain the product in detail in the 
Product Description.  The attachment below shows an example of how the fields 
would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description.  I 
have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three 
different products like this.  

Gerald, Steve--
I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one 
of you to "fix it up".  We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance 
to review it.  Just call me once you decide who should handle this--Jeff 
Hodge suggested that I start with you two.

Dave--
What does your schedule look like the rest of the week?  I'd like to get 
together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this.  Since I don't 
think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could 
get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work.   I also 
need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, 
etc.  Please let me know the process so we can get moving.  

Thanks for your assistance.

I sm preparing to open up a bidding activity for the subject Pipeline which 
is approximately four miles of 12" pipe under account # 3224.  The nbv is 
$18,901.

I have dusted off my list of salvage bidders and under separate cover will 
publish these seeking additions or deletions from any of you who care to 
contribute.  ;I am assuming that this pipe is not viably operating and would 
appreciate any information in this regard if I am incorrect.  

As for now, I would like a sample Purchase and Sale Agreement and a 
Confidentiality Agreement that I may use with my solicitations.  This would 
include some type of alignment sheet depicting the pipe and its legal 
description, etc.  You are all seasoned in knowing what level of data I need 
at this stage of the offer.

I already have at least one interested party in this and would like to move 
forward as soon as possible to get this on the table for bids.  I would 
appreciate receiving the necessary materials by October 31, or information of 
how I can contribute to this activity.  Also, please let me know if there is 
someone else I should copy on this.

Thank you in advance for your assistance in this endeavor.

Can you place these on my calendar please.  Thanks.

Attached is a memo regarding the above-referenced meeting.

Dave,  Attached is a rough draft of the letter we discussed.  The right to 
match option is a little less drastic than the "saving sharing" we 
discussed.  The savings sharing is a little more problematic to enforce.  We 
can discuss though, if that is really the way you want to go.  Please review 
and lets discuss.

Attached for your review is a form of assignment for the Trailblazer 
Precedent Agreement between ENA and Trailblazer.  This assigns the PA from 
ENA to J.M. Huber Corporation.  

A note from Bieraugel.  We need to go out and see these guys when we get a 
chance.  

Hang in there.  Things will start to come around, it is just going to take 
some time.

Gerald, Michele will be in San Diego starting Nov this year.  I won't be
back from the Gulf until March 20, 2000.  I'll be there for around two
years...then....we'll see.  I'm considering leaving the Navy.  not sure yet.
You and Lisa are always welcome.  Just let us know or just jet out for the
weekend whatever works.  Hi to Lisa.  Paul.

Hi Sophie,  

I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have 
extra Sherry on mine.  

How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with 
you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of 
the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get 
creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the 
next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.

Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the 
weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them 
is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them?  

Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line 
when you get a chance.

Please see attached.  Thanks

Ken,      Attached is the CA with my comments.    

A few interesting deals.  Working on some products for Enron's B2B internet 
trading site.  "www.enrononline.com"  The site was actually developed out of 
our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace.  
Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of 
projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days.  

Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of 
your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again.  

I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state 
was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive 
me for my mental lapses.

OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type 
substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not 
sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.

Take care,  
Gerald.

Dear Gerald,

I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to
sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good
to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had
a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an
unusual occurrence for me.
This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that
Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has
been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she
seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a
cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I
think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard
this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet.
Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and
yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should
have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy
(although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you
think? Hmm.
Anyway, better get on with some work,
have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals?

We have done a term deal with Entex Gas Marketing starting August 1, 1999. 
The term is for one year and will end July 31, 2000. This is a point specific 
deal. The delivery point is meter 8078/ Rhone Poulen Chemical Plant (Rhodia). 
The receipt points will be meter 4132/ Exxon Katy Plant Tail Gate, meter 
6780/ Oasis Katy, meter 0067/ Lone Star Katy, meter 0072/ Western Katy. The 
out rate at meter 8078 is $.075. The in rate at meters 4132, 6780, 0067, & 
0072, is $.03. This deal was done for full plant requirements up to 1,750 
MMBtus/day. We have a Intrastate Master receipt/delivery contract already set 
up with Entex Gas Marketing (012-27106-02-001). I would like for us to do a 
confirmation for this deal under this contract, and assign it a different 
number for scheduling to schedule on. Please let me know what this number 
will be so I can make all parties aware.

Kent,
If you see anything above that does not look right to you please give me a 
call.  

Thanks,

Okay, brief resume of my life to date if you like:

Born, grew up, (in England), am currently studying at Nottingham University
(E. Midlands of England) although that's not strictly true as I'm here in
Texas studying at UT Law School as part of an exchange scheme. I go back in
June or whenever and finish my degree so will finally graduate in June 2002.
(Fingers crossed). Other than that I don't do much else but eat, drink and
be merry. Actually I play the viola (and sing a bit) and that took over my
life back home but here I'm doing more of the drinking part of things - more
wine than beer though it has to be said - also better for you - well,
almost!
So there you go - does that bring back any memories?!
Hope you're having a fun week, happy halloween for yesterday - though I'm
not sure how fanatical people are about it in Houston - they certainly seem
to go all out for making a big deal of it here!

If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to 
make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise 
Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being 
unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's 
control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the 
agreement now.

I spoke with Steve Saye at WIC today and he said that they interpret the 
tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is 
the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He 
also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the 
release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He 
did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would 
try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release 
was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber 
ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of time 
so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board.

My question is, can we get the contract with Huber signed prior to receiving 
the bank approval for the WIC peice?

Mark

I haven't answered him yet.  I just plan to let him know that the contracts 
should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter.  
Any thoughts?

Gerald,

Can you please let me know where we stand with the execution of the JM Huber 
transactions and contracts that is being originated in the Denver office.  As 
you are aware the first transaction and contract we entered into did not 
contain the assignment language for the transportation on a yearly basis.  
The second transaction was to include this assignment language.  ENA 
currently has large exposure from JM Huber for the first transaction because 
the assignment contracts have not been signed as of yet, as far as I am 
aware.  If the contract negotiations are going to continue for an extended 
period of time, Credit is going to have to reserve the transactions to cover 
this exposure.  Please let me know what the status is.

Thank you,
Russell

Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be

I will remove the open season reference.  Some pipeline tariffs do refer to 
open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to 
remove it.

The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.  The EOL 
access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on 
the counterparty.

	Colleen Sullivan
	11/06/2000 12:42 PM
		 
Last week I sent copies of the product description and GTC to Becky Cantrell 
(regulatory) for comments and she did make a couple of suggestions which I 
agree with.  First, in both the description and the original GTC we refer to 
an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words "or open season" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how 
they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate 
Schedule, Primary Receipt and Delivery Point.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this.

Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product 
Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions.  
Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent 
earlier today   Please review.

Russell,  The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually 
bound to take assignment of the transportation.  We have gotten approval of 
the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments 
and capacity release documents with Huber next week.  The capacity release 
document just specifies the details of the capacity release.  Huber is bound 
by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.    I will let you know when 
these sets of documents are executed.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just 
work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I 
may be going back to Cabo in December for a business trip.  Don't ask me how 
I pulled that off.

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email 
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they 
keep you busy at V&E.

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys 
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, 
but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann 
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good 
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!

Gerald 

Attached is a redline with the changes per my discussion with Colleen.  
Please review.

Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the 
discussion we had yesterday.  I left the reimbursement provision open with 
only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the 
interconnect in some form.  I made some assumptions about equipment that 
either party would install, however this can easily be changed.

I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.  I think this would be 
best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if 
they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront 
payment before we buy or build anything.  Take a look at the draft and let me 
know if you have any questions.

Revised GTC

Attached is the revised GTC based on the latest discussion concerning 
secondary points.  Attached is a clean and redlined version.

One more revision to the GTC.  Few changes based on my discussion with Carl 
this morning.  I have attached a clean and redlined copy.  The redline is 
compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for 
Colleen's benefit.  I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective 
unless Dick or Colleen had any comments.

Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would 
spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, 
then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob 
Vila's "This Old House".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you 
"commoners" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will 
recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside 
of 2 days.

Eric and I can type up a couple of possible itineraries this weekend, based
upon some initial research. It'll include potential routes and possible
sights to see along the way. I think we can basically decide as we go. We
are also having dinner with someone Eric works with this Friday who has
been to Spain recently with his family. They went down to the Andulusian
White Hill towns near Seville. As you know, Eric and I were only in and
around Madrid, so we'll pick this guy's brain. I agree about packing light.
It sounds like we'll need a few sweaters though. I think it'll be between
50-60 during the day. I don't know if they have heat in Spain yet, so we
may get cold at night. I'm pretty confident we could find a laundry mat if
necessary. I don't want you to stink either, especially if you blow your
butt out like in Minneapolis! Nasty!!! Please bring your adapter. I blow
dry my hair in the mornings. Gerald will need to borrow it too in order to
dry his pomp. Eric and I felt that it would be easier to make our hotel
reservations once we get there. On day one, we arrive in the morning. Thus,
we'll have plenty of time to check out a couple of pre-determined hotel
options, especially since we're not in high season. We can discuss this
weekend.

Chao!

Peeps-

Is there anything that we need to do to prepare for the Crutial Clutch
Cargo
Gig that's about to occur?  FYI - I have an electricity adapter already, so
you won't need one if you don't already have one.  Jen, do you have any
idea
what laundry facilities will be like?  I'd like to take the least amount of
clothing as possible to avoid having much luggage . . . but, I don't want
to
stink for a week either.

Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.  
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to 
law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of 
glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken 
down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed 
on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

1.  In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 
2.1 correct?  Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel?
2.  In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC 
Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs 
later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to 
Huber which we will effectuate soon.  Is this correct?

Hey,

Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need 
to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in 
town this week.

The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

Attached is a clean and redlined version of the IT Agreement.  Please review 
and let me know if you have any questions.  

Mark,  Attached are documents for the Huber Transaction

Attached are the redlined docs for the docs with changes.  I made some more 
changes to the Capacity Release doc to clean several items up.

Redline of the changes we discussed.

It would probably be easiest for me to mail them to you.  What is your 
address?

You are so sweet!  Only a truly nice person would subject themselves to
someone else's corporate Christmas party.  I promise to lose a few pounds
before then, so I can squeeze into this sexy little dress that I bought for
my Tahoe trip, so you won't be too embarassed to be seen with me.  David
has pre-approved it.  The party is at the Four Seasons Hotel on Lamar.

As for the UT tickets, the only night I'm in town before Friday is Wed
night.  Are you around that night?

Mary,  Thanks for the invite to the Open House.  Unfortunately, I will be out 
of the country on vacation next week.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving.

You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it.

 Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so 
we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be 
interesting?  Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american 
football anywhere.   Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?

thanks for lunch! i knew i would remember it -- the name of the little city
in portugal is sintra. i think it is northwest of lisbon. really cool city.
have a great trip and be careful! mb

Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went
to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair
of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more
broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely
stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of
glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

hi gn. so funny...terry and david are in my group. i don't know david as
well really, but terry is a good friend and is a total riot! i don't know
how well you got to know him, but he really is just great. anyway, i have
really been working with enron south america on the cuiaba project
exclusively for the past year and a half. the enron attorneys are randy
young and john novak. prior to that i did a few structured deals --
christina mordaunt was the atty.

yes, annie wu (we just call her "the wu") is a stitch! remind me to tell
you
the story about when she came to visit me in london...and a few other
stories. she is a trip! truly a sweet person and a good friend too. i heard
you know my friend walter daniel, too. he was in my law school class and is
also a good friend.

whenever/wherever on the 14th is fine. do you like sushi? we could go to
miyako...or zydeco or becks? those are the places where i usually meet
enron
folks since they are in between... let me know! mb

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they
keep you busy at V&E.

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big
place, but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to
location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!

Hey that sounds like a better idea.  I will give the tickets to Shawna

her.  I'm not sure that I trust the US Mail that much.  My address is 501 W
16th St, 77008, though if you prefer to go that route.  What do I owe you

Hey Melissa,

I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow.  
We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review 
about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I 
guess I'll get through them.

Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at 
the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my 
tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.

We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next 
Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you 
told me at lunch!

Take care,  

Gerald

Hello!

Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.  We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on 
Sat. Morning.  We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in 
some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.    The last couple of days we 
will be in Lisbon, Portugal.  Back in Houston next Monday.    Should be a 
good time.  I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.  Sounds 
like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.  I have wanted to see the McDonalds 
Observatory.  That sounds pretty cool.

Anyway,  thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back.

I hear that you are going to Spain during the Thanksgiving Holidays? When
are you going and where are you going. Sounds like a good trip give us the
details before you leave huh!!!!
           We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We
really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full
effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and
Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.
   James came over the other day and I was keeping Jacob, so I let them draw
names for Christmas you have James's name and they didn't cheat either
Ha..... well all for now Dad and I send our love hope all is going
well........Love MOM 

I'm back.  I will review and comment on their responses.

Ken,  I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago.  
The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve 
allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have 
reviewed and executed yet?  

Attached is a letter to Wildhorse consenting to the assignment of Crescendo's 
gathering agreements from Wildhorse to Tom Brown.  The letter reserves all 
our rights for Wildhorse's breach.  Also attached is a letter for December 
nominations into Questar reserving our rights.  Please review and provide any 
comments.

your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks.

Hi MB,

Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if 
you would want to meet for a drink after work today? 

Mark,  I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.  They are as follows:

1.  ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online 
monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule.

2.  If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW 
to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.  ECS will keep TW whole on 
any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system.

This provision was written very generally.

	Mark Knippa
	12/01/2000 10:45 AM
		
Gerald, here is the address I have for Jere.  I was discussing this with him 
today.  
Lets get it over to them so we can get the monitoring system going.  He 
indicated
that Tri-State is in the process of changing/modifying how they monitor and 
charge
for demand or peaking service.  I'm real interested to see what this is.  

Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to
monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement).  The 
resources that
we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, 
EES and ET&S.  It's going to be money out of ECS's pocket I believe despite 
the fact
that it was part of our agreement with EE&CC for the turnkey construction 
quote.  I also
need to discuss with Courtney since he was heading up this effort.  

We may need to review exactly what our obligations are under the agreement.  
Oh, by
the way, TW is developing an expansion of Gallup to up the system to a full 
12,000 hp
from 10,000.

I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I 
have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the 
General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business 
call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to 
maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with 
everything else.

I can't hear you!! La La La La La La La.....................

No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are 
still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described 
my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me 
(Antibiotics or similar).  

Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good 
opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a 
better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.  

I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know.

Gerald - I am sorry that I didn't call this weekend.  I know we have a lot to 
talk about, but I have been sick all weekend and honestly couldn't face the 
stuff we have to face on top of it all.  I am still feeling ill, but was 
going crazy at home.  I don't know what I have, but I hope you don't get it.  
I decided to take the methanol job and stay in Global Markets, so my days are 
going to be decidedly busier.  Maybe we can get together for lunch later in 
the week to discuss how to move forward.

I am sorry to do this over email, but as always it is difficult to talk at my 
desk.  Let me know what your schedule looks like this week and we'll work 
something out.

Miss you,

Just wanted to drop you a note and let you know I made it back safe and sound 
from Spain.  Spain is really a neat country.  Very charming. 

So I got James' name huh?  Who got my name in the drawing?  When is everyone

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We 
have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 
year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the 
curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits.  
I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending.

Joan, Gerald, Mark,

We do not physically flow our gas into Questar. This means that our
production is being curtailed (through increased pressure) for economic
benefit to Wildhorse (at Crescendo's expense) of moving more gas from the
Natural Buttes area south through the San Arroyo area.

Ken Krisa

Due to the Mesa Tap compressor being down at the interconnect between
Wildhorse and Questar, the pressure is backing up on Wildhorse.  These
Crescendo wells are very sensitive to pressure, thus current production is
around 2,500 mcf/d [2,675 mmbtud/].  Our first of the month nom was 2,800
mcf/d [3,000 mmbtu/d].

I am not sure if you want to reduce the nom now or wait a bit.  My gut feel
is to keep the nom as is and get these higher prices - assuming prices will
come down later this month.  let me know what you think is best.

thanks
joan

Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the 
following:

1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We 
need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only 
remedies.
2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent 
with each other.

The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please 
contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss.

Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.  I also 
added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron.  
Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that we still 
need to legal entity's name from the South America office.

We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.

I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have 
been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it 
though.

Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 
am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in 
Mississippi.

Friday night?  If not, send me your address and I'll drop a check in the
mail to you since I'll be out of town much of the rest of the year.

Speaking of which, have you ever been to Acapulco?  Cyndi and I are going
there for Christmas.  If you've been, let me know if you have any
recommendations for things to do down there.

Thanks again for going the other night.  Hope I didn't make you too
uncomfortable at the end of the evening.  A little too much alcohol there
at the end of the evening.

Alan,  Attached is a redline version of the assignment with the changes we 
discussed.  I also added the geographic location difference language to the 
Buyer's Daily Obligation section to make it bi-lateral.

As of 4:00 p.m. today, the ENA executed Precedent Agreements have been 
delivered to Trailblazer.  

Trailblazer still has outstanding P.A.'s , but expect delivery tomorrow.  
Their current schedule is to send the filing to FERC on Friday with the 
actual filing date on Monday, December 18th.  Should Trailblazer not meet 
this time frame, I would suggest that the matter be taken up at higher levels 
in the organization (i.e. Julie call Deb).  

I'll follow-up on Monday.

Are you back from Brazil yet?  Hope they didn't work you too hard down 
there.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.

Attached is a draft of a nonbinding letter for use to submit the indicative

Jim, I am not sure who handled the operating permits.  I think that type of stuff was usually handled by someone in the gas pipeline group.

Gerald

Is this something that you can help us with.  If not who?
Jim,

Do you know who is responsible for cancelling the operating permits for HPL Compression?  Zero Gross Receipt Tax reports will have to be filed quarterly until that permit is canceled.    

Cindy,  Attached is the revised confirm with my changes redlined.  Let me know if this covers Nelson's concerns.

 

Gerald,
With Judy's departure from our group I have been asked to act as the liaison between the Upstream Desk and Legal. I understand that this is an outstanding issue.

After discussing with Nelson, he would like to include a clause stipulating that the three days is not a result of force majeure.

FYI...I have been waiting on Nelson to give me feedback. Rod from Mariner is waiting on a confirm.

Mr. Nemec -

This email is a follow-up to my voice message to you last week regarding the above-referenced document.  I work with Bill Mathews in the Denver office and we are preparing a compression administration agreement between Bear Paw Energy and Independent Production.  We are working off of your agreement and I was wondering if you could email me (tricia.flanigan@enron.com) the above-referenced agreement.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 720-946-3661.

Thank you,

Rudwell,  Attached is the executable form of the guaranty.  Please fill in the Cargill information and forward to Bridgeline for execution.  Also, I didn't know what the effective date should be.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Gerald!

I took a look at the proposed changes and also spoke with my counterpart at Cargill, we are fine with the changes.  Please execute a guaranty in the amount of $8MM. 

Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:

	1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.  
	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
	
I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Enfolio Master for the Ocean transaction.  The redline reflects the changes from the original draft.  Also attached is a clean version of the Transaction Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward to Ocean for their review.  

  

 

Jeff,  Attached is the redline from your earlier revisions.
 

Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues.

Russell,  The data you requested last week concerning the motor is as follows:

1.  Full Load MVA rating:  11.4 for each unit
2.  Across the line starting MVA:  43.8 for each unit
3.  Input Voltage:  12 KVA

Hey Walter,  Thanks for stopping and leaving the note.  I'm glad I got to know you at the happy hours.  We will have to schedule another Gallant Knight evening sometime soon.  Good luck to you as well.  Take care.

I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip?

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?  

I am fine with the change.  Mary, please prepare executables and make the change in the NUI document as well.
See the attached revision for the Peoples CA.  The same revision is necessary for the NUI document.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

Jared		

 

GT,  I will have an extra ticket for the game this weekend.  My friend who was going to go back out.  It is yours if you want to use it.  Let me know.

Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.   
 
 Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration.

The weekend was a blast.  I won $116 at the craps table (I'm addicted now and my dad thinks I need to join gamblers anonymous).  We kayaked on the Colorado River - about 11 miles - on Saturday and the weather was spectacular.  And we hiked the Grand Canyon on Sunday - an amazing site!  It reminded me of a spontaneous college road trip.  We had a lot of fun.  Let's talk about another football game in the future or go get drinks sometime.  
 
Have a good week!

Attached is the Burlington guaranty with my comments.  I was unable to redline the doc.  Computer problems.  I am forwarding the clean version.  Hopefully Burlington can redline against the draft they sent.

 

Ned,  I am fine with all of their changes.  Attached is a clean version reflects their changes.  Ask them to print out two copies and execute.

 

Frank,  Attached for your review is a draft of the settlement agreement we discussed.  

 

Attached is the letter.  The address information and Unocal's full name need to be inserted and then print two copies on ENA letterhead for execution.

 

I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Gerald, 
Per our conversation yesterday, attached is the Unocal Term Sheet for your review and comment.  This is a non-binding proposal.  Note that the items in red are either questionable items or rates/prices that need to be confirmed and/or filled in.  
 << File: Unocal Keystone Term Sheet (Sep-06).doc >>  

The compression guys are meeting with Unocal tomorrow (Friday) early afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet.

Please advise.

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared.

Debra,  Could you resend to Enfolio Spot Master to Mark?  Let me know if you have any questions.

You sent me a contract for these guys I was wondering if you could resend it,  It was an enfolio spot contract.

Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.

 

Attached are the Cascade Documents redlined with my changes.  Please review and let's discuss further before forward by to Cascade.  

Some items to note:

1.  As we discussed before, the non-compete provision must be approved through the proper channels at Enron.  The current Enron Corp. policy requires approvals by:
2.  We need to scrub how this will fit with EES' business in this area.

I tried to narrow the non-compete provisions as much as possible.  Let's discuss.

  

Hi Mom,  I am doing fine.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier.  Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.  I am staying busy with the usual stuff.  Talked to Sharon last week.  It sounds like she is getting really close to the time.  Another grandchild.  Are ya'll going up to Dallas shortly after the birth?

Just touching base to see if you are doing o.k. I called and left a message
and I also sent an e-mail to your house. We are just sorta antsy since all
this happened. Dad and I send our love. We love you a bunch. MOM

Andy,  I have a few comments.  Attached is a redline.

 

Ken,  Attached is your document with my comments.   

 

Gerald,

We are in discussion with Public Service Company of Colorado about acquiring
a small gathering system just north of the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  The
attached document gives a little background of the transaction and lists
some of my questions concerning this transaction.  After you review the
document, I would like to discuss these issues with you to be sure we have
addressed all Crescendo's risks and obligations.

Thanks,

Ken Krisa

 Regarding my phone message, attached is a redline reflecting Greeley's comments to the credit sections.  Please let me have your thoughts. 

 

Debra Perlingiere

Attached is the term sheet with my revisions.  Please review.  

 

Hey GT,  When are you coming to H-town?

Attached for review are the draft template GTC and Confirm forms for the monthly wellhead and pooling point purchase business of ENA Upstream.  Please review and provide any comments you may have as soon as possible.  We would like to implement these templates for October business going forward.  

Judy,  We need to discuss how the "Keep Whole" language used for the torch deal, should be incorporated into these forms for those deals with the negotiated Keep Whole.  Ellen, has scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss.  

    

It was very nice running into you also.  Banker, smanker.  G works hard for the money, so you had better treat him right.

What do you have going on this week?  Thurs. or Fri. after work would work.  (That sounds weird)

What a pleasant surprise running into you this a.m. ...you do have banker hours and I am obviously jealous !  
Let me know when you're free ...for lunch or drinks.

T-Rex 

Attached is the precedent agreement with changes redlined.  I scanned their hardcopy.  I added that same outs that were included in the Momentum agreements, but I left the dates blank.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

 

Let's discuss on Thursday.

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

Attached is the form of amendment to guaranty for Tractebel.  Do you know the $$ limits for signing authority for Bridgeline.  I.e. when do the management member have to sign a guaranty as opposed to Randy Curry?

 

FYI

Gerald,

The PSC held a pre-hearing conference today on the territorial dispute. It
was uneventful. The Hilgert testimony was admitted as Exhibit 14 to WFEA's
submission. WFEA sought a delay, Gulf opposed. No delay was granted.

Bill

I actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to Keith for him to review.  I think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer.  Do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents?  We will need to have one to finalize the documents.

Aha!  Sorry I didn't remember sooner that Taffy sent it to me electronically.  Anyway, this should make things much easier.  Please let me know if you need anything else, I'll keep you posted on the bids.  By the way, does Enron have a preferred form of payment?  Oxy wanted to know if we wanted cash or check (?!?).  Isn't a wire transfer what we usually do?

Per your request.

Keith,  Please note the following changes for the Napoleonville warehouse s=
ale docs.  I will call you to discuss further issue to getting this finaliz=
ed.

Gerald,

There were two changes to be made to the legal description of the property =
contained on the first page of the agreement as well as in Exhibit B:

1) In the third line, it should read a distance of 49.28' not 49.26'.

2) In the fourth line, the degree symbol is left off the N 51?. =20

I will send you through interoffice mail a copy of the survey plat for the =
land.  Will you or Keith take care of forwarding a copy of the agreement to=
 the police jury for review?

Rakhi

Please review.  Note that on the attached letter, we will remove the rep. c=
oncernig the "presence" of hazardous materials".  According the Kyle, there=
 may have been such material stored in the warehouse.  Kyle,  Please review=
 the letter and let me know if you see any problems.

Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

CCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" CONDITION.  THERE ARE NO WARR=
ANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE OF THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AS T=

es may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the powe=
r to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitrat=
ion shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties s=
hall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such =
equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under=
 this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either P=
arty may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respec=
t to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Part=
y is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in acc=
ordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award =
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdictio=
n hereof.

greement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Pro=
perty.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations=
 (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those =

rued as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been=
 herein contained.

rm all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be nec=
essary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreemen=
t.

f this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall contr=
ol.

=0915.=09Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms =

John, The meeting is tomorrow at 2:00 in 30C2

I would like you to attend
Let's discuss on Thursday.

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?  

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: .."judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations.."  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  "Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council."  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.  
(713) 345-8261  
 
thanks.  

Max,  Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.  They revised the Collateral limits in Section 4.5.  Let me know your thoughts.
I'll follow with a call.
The attached contract highlights the changes we have discussed.  The only other matter is the re-writing of the legal opinion.  Please look this over and we can discuss. 

Marcus

The attached document reflects the comments of my legal group to the
guaranty language provided on behalf of Burlington Resource Trading,
Inc.  He was unable to redline the document, however his comments are
incorporated in the attachment.

As discussed we are interested in a $1.5MM guaranty to cover our 60 days
receivables.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

FYI

Gerald,

The PSC held a pre-hearing conference today on the territorial dispute. It
was uneventful. The Hilgert testimony was admitted as Exhibit 14 to WFEA's
submission. WFEA sought a delay, Gulf opposed. No delay was granted.

Bill

Ned,  Attached is the revised  CSI CA based on our discussion.  The non-compete provision is removed.  As we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our Confidential Information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ECS.  However, they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our Confidential Information. 

 

Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!  Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer.

The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?

Judy,  Attached are the Torch Docs redlined with my changes.  I also changed some the the title on Exhibit A.

   

Max,  Tyrell is attempting to set up a conference call with these guys for Monday afternoon.  He will get back to us with the details.

Afternoon,
    I was able to go through Colorado Springs financials, but was unable to distinguish between natural gas system operations and the general "utility", outside of book value of the various gas, electric and water plants.  As such, if we are unable to acquire statements for the gas system itself, I don't think we can agree to CSU's redline of Scope of Agreement (point # 1 below).  
    

Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?  

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: .."judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations.."  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  "Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council."  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.  
(713) 345-8261  
 
thanks.  

Max,  Please see attached redline from Colorado Springs.  They revised the Collateral limits in Section 4.5.  Let me know your thoughts.
I'll follow with a call.
The attached contract highlights the changes we have discussed.  The only other matter is the re-writing of the legal opinion.  Please look this over and we can discuss.

Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.

Whatup Dog?  How is Enron treating you?  Still enjoying the legal side of
things?

Everything here is going well.  Marriage is still very good, even blissful.
Michigan has been great so far but I am still waiting for the weather to
turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

Rude-Dog

Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!

Overall I would give her a 5.  I would request her again.

Sometimes you just have to step up to the big leagues.  I actually didn't know how much that trash can costs.  The ex bought it.  It is stainless steel, not chrome.
I will sell you mine for $90.  I will even Lysol it for you.

Congrats on your oversized chair with ottoman.  

Are you retarded?  I went and prcied those trash cans yesterday and they are
$100.  Why would anyone need a $100 trash can?  Just kidding.

I am so very excited.  I bought a couch and a oversized chair with ottoman.
How exciting is that?

Needless to say, i did not buy your chrome trash can!

XX-Large.  Thanks.

Debra,  I think we were waiting on credit for this one.  I believe we answered their question that Atmos Energy Corp. would be the one executing the documents.  Can you check with Veronica?

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost
over and we still do not have any contracts executed.  Hope you can get this
thing unstruck and moving forward again.

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?

Mark,  Attached is a draft.  Please review and let's discuss before you send to Huber.  

 

Judy,  I added the language for release by Mariner that we discussed.  I put a 3 day threshold in the language.  Please review and lets discuss.

 

I have no idea what this is.

Gerald:  This almost looks like a joke, but then I remembered working with Shonnie on buying a truck for the Denver office recently, so you never know.  Since you're the Asset group now, I thought I'd run it by you.  -MCO

Gerald since you handled this last year, I am forwarding this to you to determine from Michelle cash [head of recruiting] to see if we are planning to participate...I cannot imagine that we are not.... thanks bng
I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   
 
Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

Hey Tracy,  Yes you are correct.  That is a fantastic picture of JJ.  Really miss that guy.  Young Frank doesn't seem to be enjoying the experience as much as Madeline.  Glad to hear things are going well for you guys.  All is good with me.  Not much new and exciting happening.  Thanks for the pics!

Hey Gerald!  I hope all is well.  The  Fillip family is doing fine.  Tom likes his new job at El Paso  Energy.  The kids are both going to school two mornings a week and I am  enjoying the break.  We are getting ready for Halloween, Madeline is going  to be a princess and Frank is going to be a cowboy.  We are also getting  ready for Frank's birthday party, he will be two next month.
 
Anyway, Cristi sent us some pictures from the  twins' birthday party. We knew you would enjoy this one of J.J.
 
I am also sending you a picture of Madeline and  Frank...there is a big difference between little girls and little girls as is  evident in their smiles.  Ha!
 
Enjoy!

 may have been such material stored in the warehouse.  Kyle,  Please review=
 the letter and let me know if you see any problems.

Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Attached are the latest per our discussion.

   

Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The rate sheet they provided would be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review.  I am ok to forward this to Power Engineers for their review.  

 

Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they would prefer to terminate or void this contract.

Attached are the revised Devon confirms based on our discussions with Shonnie.  Please review.  I am also attaching the masters again to be complete.

Upon receipt I will forward to Barry for decision to execute or not by 1:00 pm.  Thank You for your prompt attention to this matter.

 

Sounds like the trip was AMAAAAZING!!!.  Laura should seriously consider writing for Conde Naste.  

I think the best quote was  "The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the night before." 

Mark,  Attached are the committed reserves GTC along with a confirm for each of WIC's Contract #1 and Contract #2.  Please review.

   

Please review the attached I added some language at the end of the intrastate warranty.  To the extent this warranty gets changed, we will have to change the warranty in the gathering agreement.

Mary,  Please prepare a draft bi-latieral CA with the following entity:

RealEnergy, Inc.

You can use the Huber CA we just did for the form.  Please check conflicts with Kay Young as well.  Thanks.

Revised per your request.  I did remove the conditions precedent.  All outs in the Cinergy Trading Firm Contract have expired.  I understand that Kern has a final certificate from FERC.  Is this the case?

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Debra,  Please send Gary Bryan a sample master firm.  Thanks.

Gary, Jill gave me information about two (2) power plants.  See attached.

 

Troy, can you call Jill Mearz with TIE and get the same contract information for Gerald. Please forward the information to Gerald as well. Jill (972) 455-2980

Gerald, we are bidding on gas for several IPP's with this company. They are wanting to get a copy of our contract ASAP to begin the initial review process. When Troy forwards you the contract information what would be the turn around for a hard copy and email I could send them.

Phone number is (713) 853-3512.

The By-Laws are the ones we sent by fax to Barry L. ?   And yes, these are the latest that the company has.  The other question  that you have about having 2 people executing the agreements.  Yes it is  necessary that 2 of those will need to sign.  One of them will be Genaro  Larrea Mota Velazco and I believe that the other one will be Daniel Tellechea  Salido (this I will have to confirm)
 
Which is your phone number ?  I may be calling you  between the next couple of hours.

Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion.

  

Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement

   

Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.

  

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.

Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper.

Stephanie,  I made a few changes.  Please review.

 

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald
You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.

Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Re-sending.  Didn't go through the first time.

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.

Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin?  

Dave  and Gerald,
 
I just  wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give you any  problems?  I hope all is well.

Hey Ernie,  Have you been able to send email to Bieraugel?  I replied to the email address he sent, but I keep receiving undeliverable messages.

Darren, I will be meeting with Sandi in the morning to get a download.  I will get with you after that to assess where we need to go.  Thanks.

Gerald, 

I understand that you will be taking on some of Sandi's projects since she left the company.  I have been working with Sandi on an agency agreemtent between ENA and Tenaska IV Partners, related to the gas supply for the Cleburne Plant.  Has she brought you up to speed on what we need?  We are looking into selling our stake in the plant and need to finalize the agreement as soon as we can.  Please let me know what you need to finish this.  Thanks.

Daren

Nelson,  Attached is the Confirm and GTC for the deal with Devon.  Please review and if acceptable you can forward to Devon for review.

  We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.   

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

Gerald

Gerald, glad to hear that you had a wonderful time in China.  What cities
did you visit?  If you have any pics on the web let me know.

Austin still treating me well.  I could complain but it would not help.
Work is keeping me busy and I am entering triathlon season, helping my
brother run the restaurant and working on a new relationship.   A girl has
to keep her plate full! ;o)
What about you?  How is the law?  Dave told me about his new Colombian
connection!

I need a couple of CA for the following information.  The need to be bilateral agreements.  Please use the bi-lateral form, that you and I have used before.  The Enron entity is Enron Compression Services Company.  Ned will be sending a more detailed scope shortly and I will forward. Please come to me with any questions.

Per my previous voice mail, could you please prepare CA's for both:  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation,  1200 Timberloch Place, The Woodlands, TX  77251 and Duke Energy Field Services,  5718 Westheimer, Ste 2000, Houston, TX 77057. As mentioned both CA's are for the purposes of data sharing relative to Elec. compression projects. 

John,  Per our discussion, attached is a draft form of gathering agreement.  This form is a firm committed reserves gathering agreement. If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Mary,  Attached is further detail for the project descriptions for the two CAs I requested.  Please revise the CA to read "information in connection with sharing data relative to a potential electric compression project located approximately 3 miles west of Carthage, Texas in Panola, County".  Follow that form with the Duke CA as well.  Please prepare two executables of each.  Thanks for all your help.

The Anadarko project is located approx 3 mi due west of Carthage, TX  in Panola Co. 
The Duke project is located 2 mi NW of the town of Falfurrias in Jim Wells Co. TX

Both projects contemplate an eletrical drive retrofit of existing gas compression facilities. The Anadarko project is 12,000 Hp and the Duke project is 20,000 Hp. 

Let me know if you need any additional info. 

Thanks

Hey guys.  I went to Expedia.com and found the Delta Flights Referenced below for $226/person.  This is still a really good deal and I would jump all over it if I were you.  Here are the flights:

Friday, August 24 Delta #4516 IAH to ATL (departs 10:10am, arrives 1:15pm)
		   Delta #4107 ATL to MYR (departs 2:55pm, arrives 4:36pm)

Sunday, August 26 Delta #4684 MYR to ATL (departs 11:40am, arrives 12:55pm)
		     Delta #2063 ATL to IAH (departs 3:50pm, arrives 4:56pm)

For those of you who don't know how to use Expedia.com.  Just go to the website (www.expedia.com) , search flights from Houston to Myrtle Beach on the above dates and select the flights that work best for you.  You can input your frequent flier number and pay online via credit card.

Good luck and let me know if I can help at all.

Bruce

PS - If you can schedule your flights at the same time, you can share a rental car out of Myrtle Beach, SC as well.  It is about a 40 mile drive north to Ocean Isle, NC . . . site of the wedding.

  Paul,  Attached are redlines of the confirms that were revised with the changes we discussed. 

  

  Mary,  Chris is the guy who called me asking the questions.  I have a call into Sandi to see if she knows anything about this.  If not, I don't know who would know.

Dear Gerald:  I called Judy Thorn, ENA Upstream staff.  She said that as far as tax matters went, she wasn't sure who set up the structure for the company.  She said, however, that she'd had dealings with Chris Bystriansky in the tax department about the severance taxes.  He shows up as a senior tax analyst at ext. 53040.  Is he the person who called you? If not, maybe he'll have the answer your tax contact requested.   --MCO

Please disregard the prior version.

 

Brucie,  You weren't supposed to tell anybody about that!!  Maureen,  I am planning on setting up a rental car for Janel and myself and we can cut you in on that action.  Our flight leaves Myrtle Beach at 11:40 on Sunday so if you are leaving out of Myrtle Beach that might work for you also. 

Gerald

Gerald calls me Brucie all the time too; it's my nickname.  He gets G-money and I get Brucie.  Those are our gang names.

I can't believe someone else calls you Brucie!  

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Bruce

Good Morning Brucie! I have a quick question, do you know if anyone is arriving in Myrtle Beach on Friday around 4:30? If anyone arrives around that time, maybe we can share a ride somehow. Vicki and Dennis are flying into Charleston the night before and offered to pick me up on the way but I don't want to incovienice them if I don't have to. Have a good day, Maureen

FYI,  Attached is the form of lease agreement that Hanover has forwarded for our lease of the compression equipment from Hanover on the Oakhill deal.  This is actually GE Capital's form of lease agreement, but would be executed between Hanover and Enron Compression Services Company.  Please review and provide any comments you may have.
	Gerald,
	
	Dave Gutierrez with Hanover has provided the following template agreements.
	Apparently Hanover's methodology for this Operating Lease takes the investment
	of equipment, packaging and installation to GE Capital for the resulting Operating
	Lease structure.

Mark,

Per Dave Gutierrez's request, I am forwarding to you our Master Lease
Agreement and documents for a synthetic lease structure as an operating
lease.
Please let me or Dave know if you have questions or comments about any of
these documents below.

Gerald,
Dave Gutierrez with Hanover provided the following response regarding the documents he forwarded to me regarding the GE Capital (Operating Lease).  
I believe that I get the picture,  but it seems that he would have made the changes he has referenced.  

Lets discuss,
mk

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.

>>> "Knippa, Mark" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

Dave,  Made a few slight tweaks.

 

Mary,  Is this an operational type filing or an entity type filing?  If it is operational, then it is probably someone else's issue.

Dear Gerald:  I've received a notice re LRCI, Inc. - Crawfish plant.  We're delinquent on our "Form R6" and a penalty has been levied ($250.00).  I think this is the sort of regulatory matter that used to be handled by Juanita Marchant, who has moved to AEP.  Do you know who is in charge of handling these kinds of filings?

Mr.  Cook,  How is life at AEP?  The big E is still the same.  Minus about 4 attorneys who decided to join you.

Attached are the schedules with my revisions redlined.

  

Here are the documents we reviewed this morning.  

   

Thanks for the email.  We are expecting you on Monday the 2nd.  Everything should be set up.  I believe you have to see HR the morning you start to get your ID badge, but they should send you to us thereafter shortly.  Give me a call if you need any help with anything.  (713) 853-3512.

Hi Gerald,

I hope that things have gone well with your first set
of law clerks.  I was writing to confirm that I will
be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.  I have
been trying to contact the HR representative that I
spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my
calls.  I just wanted to make sure that everything was
set for me to begin working.

I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the
HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.  I
wanted to thank you for remembering me.  I think that
will be a great opportunity for me.

If you need to contact me, my phone number is
713-523-4723
or my mobile is 281-814-9934.

Sincerely,

Alisha Mahabir

Hi Gerald,

I didn't get a copy of the new Committed Reserves/First Purchaser GTC from you last night.  I didn't know you if you forgot or if there was a problem with the email, so I thought I'd ask again.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

If you can fit it in.  I am pretty covered with ENA Upstream right now.

Are you going to do this or do you want me to?

Tried to send this earlier.  Will try again.

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald
You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.

Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

  

I am going.

Hey Dan,  Good to hear from you.  I am doing fine. Sounds like fun.  I will try to make it.  I might get caught up here at work though.  I am leaving the country on Thursday for 4 days, so I am trying to tie up some loose ends here.  All my stripper friends are not returning my calls for some reason!  Hmmph!!.

Hey Gerald,
How you doing.  Gayle and I are having everyone over
for burgers and dogs on the 4th at around 1:30 pm.
We'd sure like you to come if you can.  Beers will be
furnished.  You don't have to bring anything (well,
may be a stripper friend of yours who has loose morals
would be o.k.)  Really, we'd like you to come.  Feel
free to bring a friend if you wish.

Let us know.

Look forward to seeing you....Dan

Haswell will be working tomorrow. He will not be in Thursday or Friday. I can call him tomorrow and that will give you the remainder of the afternoon to circulate your responses. I have to leave shortly for a dentists appointment of long standing. You could call Haswell if you prefer, but I think it better that I act as buffer. You can always fire me if I screw up.

Mary,  Can you please prepare the form of CA we have used before for Enron Compression Services Company based on the information provide by Chris below.  Thanks.

Gerald,

Can I get a standard CA put together for the following company:

Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P.
500 Dallas
Suite 1100
Houston, TX  77002

The topic would be related to "certain compression assets in the SACROC Unit in Scurry County, TX."  I would like to get something to them ASAP, but no later than Monday as we are trying to meet with them on Friday morning next week.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Chris

Did she indicate why  they had Enron Energy Services on the cover memo.  Was that a mistake?

Gerald,

Sandra Grimes at Oasis Pipe Line Company e-mailed me copies of the entire contract.  She has indicated that these are the contracts which contain the language of the re-negotiations per the cover letter dated October 3, 2000.  These are also the same contracts that you are currently reviewing.

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.

Attached is the letter with our comments.  Please review.  We are OK to send this out today.

 

Rudwell,  Attached are my comments to ONEOK's form of guaranty.

  

FYI

Let's discuss
We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on =
El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect=
 that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court app=
eal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requ=
irements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they=
 are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocation=
s exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 3=
36.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges tha=
t EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the=
 capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from =
any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I thin=
k this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says "any=
" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I w=
ould not advise inserting the usual  "final, non-appealable order" since yo=
u want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be=
 themselves changed by a later order. =20

Hope this makes sense.  =20

Oops - here they are...
Latest doc's.  pls review and comment on wording applicable to regulatory i=
ndicator that triggers events.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the C=
apacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would s=
till make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the =
gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Per my voicemail, attached is the master spot contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is the revised CA per my discussion with their attorney.  Please review and forward to Anadarko.

 

Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out.

Gerald,

If you are ok with this, would you please put together executable copies for us to sign and get to Ormat.  If not, let me know.

The CA looks okay.  I made one change in para 4 that requires Enron to identify and mark the confidential information sent to Ormat.  I presume that not ALL correspondence between us will have to do with structured horsepower transactions.

See attached.

Rusk County Electric Cooperative, Inc.

Henderson, Texas 75653-1169

The scope for the two CAs is as follows:

1.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at OGS Pipeline, L.L.C.'s Hinkle Compressor Station"

2.  "discussions concerning a potential electric compression project at Anadarko Energy Services Company's Carthage Facility"

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help!

Based on our discussions yesterday, attached are the BHP Confirm and GTC.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  We still need to input the Delivery Point information.

  

Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.

Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.

Gerald,

Where are we in the process of gathering e-mails and other discovery that may be responsive to WFLA's request? Also, can I tell John Haswell that our contract with Gulf does contain a confidentiality clause? We discussed this but I can't remember if we agreed that I could disclose it.

Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
SBR x30569

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.  

Gerald, is the capacity release for Columbia Pipeline the only transport or storage product offered on EOL that you know of?   Is Enron always the owner of the capacity to be released and acquired via EOL?  bng

This deal was done some time ago.   I assume that all ENA Upstream deal makers going forward know they should be going through you.

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,

I believe this is the Confirmation, as prepared by Legal. Please follow up with Nelson to see if he sent it out and got an Executed copy back.

Many thanks,
Ellen
Nelson,  Attached is the Confirm and GTC for the deal with Devon.  Please review and if acceptable you can forward to Devon for review.

I don't want to know what Paul did in a hot tub with Lars.  I know he is easy, but jeez.  

Just so you know - we (me, barry, stephanie, Mark Whitt, and lucci) met lars ulrich and went to a party with him Monday night.  hot tubs were involved.  We breifly thought about you -

Attached is a draft of the McCook agreement.  I am still cleaning up the Management Services Agreement (for scheduling etc.) to be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review 

 

Mark,  Could you please review the attached.  The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.  ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the Enron entity needing access.  The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.  Let me know if I am mistaken.  Thanks.

Gerald,

Can you please take a look at the attached agreement. Kathy Kelly is trying to get set up on this system to get better trading information. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Judy

Judy,

Can you please have either Jeff Hodge or Gerald Nemec take a look at this ASAP.  I would like to get us hooked up on this as quickly as possible.  Meaning 2 weeks ago.

Thanks,

Kathy

Please have Jeff Hodge review this agreement for Natural Gas.  This is one of our top priorities.

Judy,  Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.  Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.  Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.  Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.  Thanks.

 

I am fowarding the originals to you.  Please obtain execution for ENA Upstream and ENA and return them both to me.  Thanks.

Looks like everything except the bank information is the same.  I filled it out.

Thanks for the quick turnaround on that.  Any word on when we can expect this to be set for hearing?

work permit to dewater is approved.  I will forward a hardcopy upon
receipt.

The subject permit has been approved. Bridgeline may begin dewatering
operations at any time. The approved permit number is 20672.  The
hardcopy of the approved permit will be mailed to you this afternoon.
The permit only approves dewatering of the cavern. It does not approve
gas storage.

Stephanie,  Attached is the revised agreement with my changes.  

 

Attached are the revised CA's for the compression projects with Rusk County.  I have added Northeast Texas as a party to both agreements.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

  

Revised per our discussion.  Please forward to Citizens.

 

With my revisions:

 

Nelson,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments	

1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  

2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues.
	A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach
	B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase". We would have to tie this down.
	C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.

3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity

In summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper?

Gerald:

Please take a look at the attached contract from a potential producer.  Let me know what you think or any comments you have.

Well what do you know.
Please Review!

Sorry to hear about Aunt Lillie.    Good to hear everything is ok with you guys.  Everything is going well here.  Just the usual with work and weekend activities.  Been spending a little more time with Paul, since he is not going to Tulsa every week.  Take care and a I love you both.

Just got back from Austin. I was at a convention. I was a delegate to the
K.J.Z.T. Insurance Convention at the Omni Hotel.I really enjoyed it learned
quiet a bit. Had dinner with Wayne Saturday nite. It was his birthday. Happy
Birthday Wayne!!!!! He's doing o.k.
   I got home last nite really tired. Found out that Aunt Lille Jurica
passed away Saturday. The rosary is tonight and the funeral tomorrow. She
has been in a nursing home for a while now. She was 83 years old.
   We are all o.k. we send our love to all of.......love MOM 

Hey E,  Good to hear from you again.  Not much new around here.  Working and partying.  Still trying to restock the girlfriend pipeline.  George's email is gtownsend@manorisd.net.  I haven't played any golf recently, but do like to play.  I am pretty horrible, but it is fun nonetheless.  I would definetly be up for a round some time. Let me know.  

Have you been able to email Bieraugel at the last address he sent?  I have tried, but my emails keep getting bounced back to me.

	Hey G,

	Haven't heard from you, what's going on?  Things are same 'ol here
at work, am going on vacation to San Antonio next week.  Hey, I'm going to
be in Austin tomorrow for work and am planning to play golf in the
afternoon.  I plan to play at a course that is towards Houston on 290, and
since George works out there somewhere, I thought he might be able to join
in.  Do you have his email and/or phone numbers (work/home)?

	Have you been playing any golf?  We got a new analyst here at work
from UT and he's got got fever.  He got me to play last Friday (my first
time in Houston!) and now I've got the fever again.  My wife is not
thrilled, but.................  So if you play at all, we should hook up.

	Thanks,

	Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
little
	early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
good
	time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

	It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
last
	week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
the new
	car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
on
	Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

	Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
him
	since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

	     Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
are
	flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
(sp?), a
	place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
there at
	about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
to the
	downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
of mine
	from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
well.
	Are
	you game?

	     Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:

	     Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
getting
	into
	     Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
(281)
	772-9250.
	     If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
don't
	you just
	     call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
we'll
	ride
	     over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
seeing
	with me.
	     My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
	wedding is
	     at 7.

	     Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

	Hotel Room Confirmation

	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Nathan,  Can you describe where Encore compression is located? 

Gerald,

Here is the information that you requested.

Counter party:  

Encore Acquisition Partners

Address:  

777 Main St., Ste. 1400
Fort Worth, TX 76102

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Judy,  Attached is the GTC to be used for the Mariner deal with the revisions we discussed.  I will be out Thurs. and Fri. but will check voicemail.  

 

Haven't heard anything on this deal.

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?  

Thanks,

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

 Gerald,

I am so sorry, I honestly forgot about lunch. No excuses on my part, I feel
soooo bad. If you two are not totally mad at me, then perhaps, we can really
have lunch again on me. I feel like an idiot. I hope you and Debra will
forgive me. Tell Debra I apologize for missing lunch. I will e-mail her
myself. Anyway, e-mail me back please to let me know.

Sorry,

Majed
Where were you?  We waited and waited.  Debra says that you owe her two
lunches now!

      No problem.  I will just destroy the direct deposit slip.  Good
luck
      with
      the write on competition.  Lunch sounds great.  This week is kind
of
      busy
      but maybe next week.  Tuesday or Wednesday?  Yes, I guess we can
   allow
      Debra to go with us.

         Gerald,

         I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding
the
      message
         you
         left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition
   for
      law
         review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
      deposit,
         so
         I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new
clerk?
   I
         hope
         all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch
so
   we
      can
         all
         go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want
to
   say
         that it
         was great working with you. Write back soon.

         Best Regards,

Hey Sam,  Actually it comes out every weekend as much as I try to control it.  I had a great time.  We will have to do that again sometime! 

In addition to the previous email that I sent to the group, you all know that as the "sole survivors" of Friday night, I had to send you a separate email:

Mike: Thank you, thank you, and thank you? for your wisdom, encouragement, and especially for letting me out of having to "wax on - wax off."

Coralina (the "Closer") Rivera:  Call me, we must go dancing again.

Gerald:  It was fun to see the party animal side to you, I knew you had it in you despite your conservative office demeanor.

John:  It is your pool table now? "TH--WACK!"

Stephen:  We are forever in your debt for introducing the Gallant Knight to us.

Keep in touch,
Sam

Page 13 of the Sorrento ROW agmt has only one line on it "Exhibit 'B' of LRCI Grant of Servitude of Right of Use for Pipeline Agreement"

Should that be in there or can we delete that page?

Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of  "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"  We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.  I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.  

P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him. ;-)       

Gerald

Keith,  Attached is the form PSA for the sale of the Napoleonville Lot and Warehouse we discussed.  LRCI, Inc. not Houston Pipe Line Company will be the selling Enron entity.  You should be receiving the appraisal that was prepared for the land today via Fedex.  Let me know if you have any questions.  (713) 853-3512.

 

Brent,  Please see the revised guaranty.

 

Here is the revised draft with ENA Upstream Company, LLC added to the guaranty.  Gerald would you be the one to describe the transactions in the "Whereas" clauses for this entity?

 << File: Dukeguarantymulti Enron(8-6-01).doc >> 
Brent, 
Everything looks fine from Credit's standpoint, but I forgot to mention one Enron Entity. Please add ENA Upstream Company, LLC to the list of companies covered. This entity will transact Physical Natural Gas, possibly with all 3 Duke Entities. Sorry about any confusion that this might cause.

At your request I have attempted to put together a format for the Enron Corp. Guaranty covering multiple Enron Entities and three Duke entities for financial gas, physical gas and other products to be defined.  When we have finalized what we want this form to look like I will create the corresponding Duke Guaranty.  

Darren, do we have any outstanding Enron Corp. Guaranties that this guaranty will supercede?

John and Jeff, can you fill in the descriptive "Whereas" clauses relating to the Enron entities and products that you handle?  Please call me if you have any questions on what we are trying to do with this document.

Brent,
I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and "encouraged," but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.

Do you have an address for these guys?

Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Attached is the template for the FM letter. Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Jean,  For your review.  Specifically, the scope in the lead in paragraph.

 

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.

  

Judy,  I will be working on that form next.  Should be ready tommorrow or Monday.  For the Linder dealer we can use the firm GTC with a modified DCQ.  I forwarded the language for the DCQ to Ellen.  

Gerald,

Do we have a format for producer gas that is not committed and not pool gas? (i.e. Linder cannot "commit" their gas to us because of credit reasons but the gas is still 100% ours for the month)

Thanks,
Judy

Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas

GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,

We might want to forward this email version for their review first.  I would think that their attorney's might have a few comments.

Joan,  Attached is the agency agreement form.  The form still refers to TBI Field Services.  This should be revised to reflect the current owner of the system.  Can you provide that info.  

 

It is still on Chris Hilgert's desk.  I will bug him to get it back to you.  Sorry for the delay.
 
 

Gerald - where are we on getting the CSA (as amended) executed?

Paul,  Attached is the revised letter Agreement for Greeley.  Please review and if you are OK with it, please forward to Greeley.  They had asked that we drop the contract number references in the first paragraph, but we need to have some way of identifying the contracts under which we are acting as agent, so l kept them in the document.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

That sounds good.  Schedule it up with Majed.

 Are you free for lunch with Majed on Friday?

Alan,  With respect to the Transactions for Cheyenne and Public Service Company, Enron prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.  These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.  The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.  There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and Enron requires this language for any firm deal.  Enron's general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month. I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.    

Debra,

I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
send them to you for review.

I look forward to your reply.

The only change is in Section 2.  I refer to the requirement to schedule the Daily Contract Quantity instead the Nomination.

In a nutshell, what changed on this version?  I haven't compared it against the old one yet.

Thanks.  Do you anticipate any more changes to this version?

Please use the attached GTC is place of the previously forwarded for all deals going forward.

Yea,  Things have changed quite a bit.  Life as usual at Enron.

So, are you missing Paula up there?  At least you have Keegan to keep you company now.

I heard that I missed a pretty wild happy hour last week.........

Randy, For your information, I am forwarding you a summary of my review of the Bridgeline documents concerning the Texaco Sorrento cavern issues This summary was prepared on behalf of Enron.

Fyi

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

Keegan, I think the attached is a Word Perfect File.  Can you try to convert this file to an MSWord file.  Thanks.

Gerald:

Attached is my draft "Purchase and Sale Agreement" based on the form
used in Texas.  The following are the major revisions which I made:

1.  I put the property description in the body of the agreement.  It is
short enough and I find this prevents problems which occasionally come
up when using Exhibits.  I also added a blank for the municipal address
of the improvements.  This is required by Louisiana law, IF the property
has an address.

2.  In paragraph "1"  and in the Act of Cash Sale, I added a reservation
of mineral rights.  If you are not concerned about this it can be taken
out.

3.  In paragraph "3"  I added language specifically waiving buyer's
claims under the Louisiana laws of Redibition  which are specific legal
warranties.

4.  I changed paragraph "5" to limit buyer's indemnity to matters
arising after the closing date.

5.  In paragraph "7"  I added a provision to allow the arbitrator to
order specific performance.  I also added provisions allowing the
parties to enforce the arbitrator's orders in court, and allowing the
parties resort to the courts for injunctive relief, if necessary.

6.  I added a provision for awarding attorney's fees in paragraph "13".

7.  I added paragraphs "12", "14", & "15" which are helpful boilerplate.

8.  I added Paragraph "16" to provide a drop dead date.  The length of
time is purely arbitrary.

Please call or e-mail me with any questions.

Would you like me to handle the closing also?

That sounds good.  We'll see you at 12 on Friday.

 Dear Debra and Gerald,

Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could pick
you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in downtown(they
have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch, so if
your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

Best Regards,

 Friday is good for lunch.  12:00 @ your choice.

Paul,  Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the changes we discussed.  Please review and forward to Greeley for their review.

 

Attached is the draft that was provided to WFEC's counsel.  As I stated they have requested to depose ECS as well.

 

I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.

Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a hall pass from your better half.

	I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some
stock today.  I think the punding you guys have taken is getting a little
carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I think
your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
do.....................

	Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to
go into my busy planning period, Sept-Nov, so not looking forward to that
much.  Kids are doing well and two of my three start pre-school next week,
so mama is relieved.

	Take care,

little
	early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
good
	time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

	It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
last
	week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
the new
	car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
on
	Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

	Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
him

	Hotel Room Confirmation

	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we

Keith,  Attached is the revised PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse.  I removed the mineral rights reservations and added in the sales price.  Please review. The agreement needs to be forwarded for review by the Assumption Police Jury as follows:

Attn:  Kim Torres
Assumption Parish Police Jury
P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Attached is the redline version.

 

Attached is a draft of the mowing letter for Assumption Parish.  Please review.  The address needs to be added in Exhibit A.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

David Marshall (risk management, insurance group) will be the one to set the limits.  I usually send a copy of the agreement and ask for his comments.  I can handle once we get a draft of the agreement.  

Gerald,

How should I handle this?  Is this something normally done during the legal (risk mgmt., etc.) review by someone in your group, RAC....???  

Gracias!

Dave

Dave,

I am working on the agreement now.  Please don't forget to get with Don
Rollins (at ENA) to determine  the insurance and the limits we will require
the operating company to carry.
Thx

Ken

Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Boeing Contract with my revisions.  Please review, specifically Section 4.2 and Article 7.  I want to make sure you are OK with those sections specifically.  Sorry for the delay on this.

  

Brent,  Please see the revised guaranty.

 

Here is the revised draft with ENA Upstream Company, LLC added to the guaranty.  Gerald would you be the one to describe the transactions in the "Whereas" clauses for this entity?

 << File: Dukeguarantymulti Enron(8-6-01).doc >> 
Brent, 
Everything looks fine from Credit's standpoint, but I forgot to mention one Enron Entity. Please add ENA Upstream Company, LLC to the list of companies covered. This entity will transact Physical Natural Gas, possibly with all 3 Duke Entities. Sorry about any confusion that this might cause.

At your request I have attempted to put together a format for the Enron Corp. Guaranty covering multiple Enron Entities and three Duke entities for financial gas, physical gas and other products to be defined.  When we have finalized what we want this form to look like I will create the corresponding Duke Guaranty.  

Darren, do we have any outstanding Enron Corp. Guaranties that this guaranty will supercede?

John and Jeff, can you fill in the descriptive "Whereas" clauses relating to the Enron entities and products that you handle?  Please call me if you have any questions on what we are trying to do with this document. 

 << File: Dukeguarantymulti Enron(8-6-01).doc >> 

Thanks,

Brent,
I spoke with Lisa Herman late Thursday and proposed the multi-product/mulit-affiliate grty. She seemed excited and "encouraged," but wanted an additional entity added, Duke Energy Field Services, LP.  This entity will only comduct PHYSICAL business. Let mw know what I can do to help speed along the process.

Jean,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.  

Gerald,

Please find attached our C.A. with Marathon's modifications.  After receiving appropriate legal examination, I would like to turn around this C.A. A.S.A.P. (i.e., today). 

Best Regards,

Jean
Jean,

Thanks for your note. Please find attached the CA with some minor
changes. If acceptable please sign and return two copies for our
signature. Also on a separate note, we have named a manager to pursue
this strategy going forward. I would like to introduce you to Walt Madro
on my return at the end of the week.

Regards

Paul

Paul,

As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a
draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management
outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify
initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further
refined by a transaction team.

I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in
the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal
department.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, 

Jean

Apparently there are some problems regarding cutting checks for some of the Kern producers.  As such, we have to switch the letters around to reflect wire transfers.  In the case of The pertinent information for the letters requiring revision is as follows:

1) Kennedy Oil
First Interstate Bank of Commerce
Gillette Branch
ABA# 102300129
Account# 362170342

2) J.M. Huber Corporation
ABA: 021000089
Acct: 00050892

3) Patina Oil & Gas Corporation
Wells Fargo Bank, Seattle
ABA: 121000248
Acct. 4296915515

4) FMI Weld
The only thing that needs to change is the account number.  The correct number is:
1018233241

The letters will have to reflect payment as of tomorrow.  I'll call you shortly to follow up.

Thanks.

Shane,  Can you send me the highlighted document that you forwarded for their review.  I need to see the revision to understand their issue.

    Gerald:  
   Please review the reply from  Mojave regarding "our" standard GISB TPA.  Please comment.

   Thanks

   Shane

Shane,
	Please clarify the intent of the requested change to section 5.

Thanks,

Chris,  Richard and I have come to agreement on the Shell CA.  Attached is a redline with the changes.  Please forward to Shell for their review and I will send down executables.

There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.  There isn't too much towards Enron.  I don't mind going towards your building.  You have probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building. Good Italian. There is also a Cafe Express down there. I am OK with any of those.  Do you like Sushi?  There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center.
I'm in Pennzoil at Louisiana and Rusk.  I usually meet my Enron friends at
NY Pizzeria or Ninfas, but neither sound good this week.  Do you know any
other good places in between?

Still good for me.  How about we meet at 12:00.  Which building are you in?
We can meet somewhere in between.

   Tuesday or Thursday work for me.  Thursday is a little looser, so that

      Hey Jen,  Thanks for the invite, but I am going to the Astros game
      tonight.
      My brother is coming in, so I got some freebie tixs for the game.  We

         You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring
   basics.
      I
         have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I
      should,
         however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all
   my
         mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess,

            Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so
   I
         stayed
            home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.
   He
         plays
            the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session
   (or
      at
            least
            we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I
      went
            furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got
      kinda
         of
            sick
            of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem
   so
            pathetic
            when people visit.

            Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the
   mango
            margarita
            though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds
   fruity!!

         Saturday,
               but I
               was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I finally

               on

      exciting?
         I
               was
               invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night,
   but
      I
            thought
               that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I
   begged
         off.

Let's discuss when you get a chance.

He called today and left the following message:

"He would like to know if you were able to square away Enron Corporate Representatives for depositions on September 10, 11, 12.  He would agree to do these by phone."

Phone is better than in person. Easier to cut off offensive inquiry. What do you think about making someone available in Houston?

In the meantime, I'll try to get more information about questions he would like to ask. I doubt that I will have any success in that effort.

Sounds good.  I'll see you there.

I love sushi.  Do you want to say Miyako at noon?

There is a Treebeard's in the tunnel at 1100 Lousiana.  There isn't too
much towards Enron.  I don't mind going towards your building.  You have
probably been to Bucco di Bacco (sp?) over by your building. Good Italian.
There is also a Cafe Express down there. I am OK with any of those.  Do you
like Sushi?  There is a Miyako in the Bank One Center.

   I'm in Pennzoil at Louisiana and Rusk.  I usually meet my Enron friends
   at
   NY Pizzeria or Ninfas, but neither sound good this week.  Do you know
   any
   other good places in between?

   Still good for me.  How about we meet at 12:00.  Which building are you
   in?
   We can meet somewhere in between.

            You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring
      basics.
         I
            have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I
         should,
            however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover

               Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt
   so
      I
            stayed
               home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends
   house.
      He
            plays
               the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session
      (or
         at
               least
               we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday
   I
         went
               furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I
   got
         kinda
            of
               sick
               of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't
   seem
      so
               pathetic
               when people visit.

               Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the
      mango
               margarita
               though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds
      fruity!!

                  Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
         exciting?
            I
                  was
                  invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday
   night,
      but
         I
               thought
                  that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I
      begged
            off.

Dave, How about tommorrow at 2 pm central.  Let me know.

Gerald,

Is there a good time at which Mark Whitt and I could call you and discuss the Cascade deal?  Shoot me a time that works for you and we'll call you.  I doubt it would take more than half an hour.

Thanks,

Needs the facts filled in.

 

It was great talking with you at lunch.  I have never known a real life tap dancer before.  I feel honored.  I am outta here tomorrow, so have a great weekend.

Made a few slight revisions.

 

No problem.  Let it go.

Gerald this looks fine to me. Do you have any objections to sending  this out as a draft and we can get them to change the legal name if necessary at that time? Everything I have seen just says Illinois Power.

Attached is a draft of the CA.  Please review.  I need the full legal name of Illinois Power.

 << File: IllinoisPowerCA.doc >> 

Chris,  Attached is a form of interconnect agreement with reimbursement language that you requested on behalf of Hugh Connett.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

The entity should be LRCI, Inc.  You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald, 

Any luck on the LRCI-LRPC issue?

Jean, Based on Richard's reply, I am OK with the strike.  I just wanted to make it clear that ENA does compete with Marathon is these areas, but ENA would certainly only use the Confidential Information for the purposes of the proposed Transactions.  Do you want me to prepare executables? 

 

Jean, 

I'm on my way to Jakarta so it would probably be best to handle this by e-mail.  I don't have Gerald's e-mail address so would you please forward this to him.

Gerald, 

My reasons for striking the sentence are: 

1)  I couldn't figure out what it added to the prior sentence. 
2)  I'm concerned it negates Article 4, which states that, except as otherwise provided in the agreement, Confidential Information will only be used to evaluate, negotiate, and consummate proposed Transactions.  The stricken language could be interpreted to allow the use of the Confidential Information to acquire businesses, facilities, contract rights, etc.  

At a minimum, the stricken language should be modified to make it clear that a Party may not use Confidential Information received under this Agreement in pursuit of such activities.

Mary,  Can you check to see if Jempy can sign for LRCI, Inc. and let Rakhi Israni know?  In the alternative, please provide her a copy of the corporate data sheet which list the VPs who can execute documents for LRCI.

Is Jempy Neyman authorized to sign for LRCI?  By the way, do you know if Keith Daigle has already sent the purchase agreement to the Parish?

The entity should be LRCI, Inc.  You can change the entity in the letter and send it out.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Few comments.

 

I don't know the status of the Crawfish documents.  I will have to check.  Steve Van Hooser was handling those documents.  With respect to your previous question, the PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse went to the Assumption Parish last week.

Gerald,

Thanks for your help on the Assumption Parish documents. 

Do you know the status on the documents related to Bridgeline's request for easements/ROWs on the Crawfish land?   It seems that Keith Daigle is the one drafting the documents.  Please let me know.

Rakhi,

Mary Ogden found and has provided Eva Rainer the missing documentation relevant to your Item 2; I believe Eva has already provided Texas Brine what is needed to clear up confusion relative to the various Enron entity transfers that took place prior to LRCI's conveyance to Texas Brine.

As to Item 1, I would ask that you work with Gerald Nemec of the EWS legal department.  He's been overseeing the Napoleonville work and will be able to oversee and work with Keith Daigle and Roger Westbrook on the Crawfish Right-of -Way work.

I have recently joined the Enron Industrial Markets legal team and am divesting of all my former Gas Assets and Trading work.  Gerald can be reached at 3-3512.

Thanks,

Steve

Steve,

I was hoping you could help me with the following two issues.  I am not sure who in legal is working on these.  

1) Crawfish Right-of-Ways (counterparty:  Bridgeline) - Bridgeline is requesting ROWs/easements on the Crawfish land in LA.  Keith Daigle, I suppose, is the one who would be actually drafting the agreements.  Roger Westbrook recently received the plats and general descriptions which are to be attached to the agreements.  Would you know the status on these documents?    

2) Napoleonville (counterparty: Texas Brine) - Texas Brine purchase approximately 16.6 acres from Enron at the Napoleonville Salt Dome earlier this year.  Texas Brine is attempting to clear title for this land.  The executed documents from the sale of the land from Enron Storage Co to Bridgeline Storage Co and then from Bridgeline Storage Co to LRCI.  were apparently never filed at the courthouse.  Texas Brine is very eager to get this cleared up.  Do you know whether Legal has these documents?    

Thanks for your help,

Rakhi

Hey Jennifer,  How is it going? Did you survive your long run this weekend?  It has been pretty crazy here since I got back.  I really need to start focusing more on the guitar so I can become rich and famous and not have to deal with all this.  I am so tired. 

The sections are 18 CFR Part 161.  Specifically Section 161.1, 161.2, and 161.3.  

Alan,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of Enron's Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.  

  

Enron's preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.

1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does.
2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters.
3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  Enron prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues.
4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters.
5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.

Putting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.    

Do you have any tiered pricing language for 5 tiers?

Ellen

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.
Lisa  5 4766

Attached is the revised Committed Reserves Confirm with the language we discussed.  Please modify the confirm templates for the Sept. wellhead deals (and those remaining from August) to reflect the revision.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Janette, To be more complete, the MS Word program Barbara and I were referring to on voicemail removes the Meta Data from the document.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Shane,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language.

    

      Donna Greif has asked me to initiate tpas with about 20 to 22 pipes for the two EES companies.   I am sure that Tennessee and  EPNG will again
      raise the same issue as they did with the language in Section 7 when we initiated tpas for ENA and  ENA Upstream.  
      In order to maintain consistency, should I remove the line referencing the 3.2B omission?

      The tpa between EPNG and ENA does not have this line item.
      The tpa between Tennessee and ENA as well as between Tennessee and ENA Upstream does not have this either.
      
      Mojave also has the same issue with this, they are refusing to sign the tpa with us for ENA.

      These are all EL Paso owned pipes.

      I have already contacted someone at Tennessee, and they want the exact same language as the previous tp agreements.
      

    Thanks

   Shane

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.

Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached is a draft of the Keep Whole language we discussed last week.  Please review and provide any comments you may have.

 

Deb,  Could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities:

Louisiana Resources Company
LRCI, Inc.
Louisiana Gas Marketing Company
LGMI, Inc.

Thanks

Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues.

Who keeps the books for Bridgeline?  In other words, how can we find out if they have paid their $1,000,000?  Please let me know.

Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.

We need to figure out how to play this out ASAP so that we know how much cash needs to be sent out.  My guess is that we would prefer to have Bridgeline pay Dow directly.  I have a voicemail from the guy at Dow and would like to get back with him on our plan.  Let me know.  Thanks.

I know how you feel.  No way Nebraska should be playing for the championship.  Should be Oregon.

I will see if we can get someone from the bankruptcy team for Wed.

Gerald,

I just finished visiting with Mark Knippa about Enron Compression Services.  It probably makes sense to get together with you and someone on the bankruptcy team to talk about how we should handle all of the deals in ECS.  Can we set something up for Wednesday?  I have asked Mark to put together deal structure charts and explanations so that we have something to present to the bankruptcy lawyers for consideration at this meeting.  I would ask that you work with him to verify the accuracy of those charts/explanations.

Stuart

Well, it's been a while, but we have been busy.  Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening.  In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program.  Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm

Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA.  They were signing autographs and having a great time.  Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals.  It was great.

By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI.  I'm happy to report that the program is a big success!  The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check.  We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed.  Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters.

I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society.  Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver

The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us.  So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family?  Here is an idea.  We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website.  One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course.  Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI.  Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2  And don't forget to wish them happy holidays.  It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing.

If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle.  "She" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event.  Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home.

If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it!  Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week.  Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event.  Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available.

I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.

Blanket Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Section 7C of the Natural Gas Act and 18 CFR 284.402.

Your thoughts?

I agree with Chip but question which would be faster.  I think both routes are identical in terms of result but may differ in the amount of time needed to accomplish them.  I believe that we are allowed to enter into new agreements, without court approval, provided that they are in the ordinary course.  My understanding of the process for assuming an existing contract is that it typically requires some oversight/approval by the bankruptcy court/creditors committee and further it may require the debtor to rectify any prior defaults (I am less sure of this one).  Obviously, a bankruptcy lawyer should be consulted.  By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Gerald Nemec to run this to ground with one of the A&K or Weil lawyers.

Stuart

We may not want to put a new contract in place.  Court "acceptance" of the existing contract may be the most appropriate thing to do.  In that case, PB-KBB should have no concerns about post-petition payments.

Bob:

I spoke with Duane Harris from PB-KBB (Tommy Smith's boss) regarding the Napoleanville work.  I briefed him on how the pre and post bankruptcy invoices will be treated.  They are willing to keep working provided we do the following:

1.	Provide an accounting of what invoices are pre and what invoices are post bankruptcy - so we can get on the same page with them regarding the numbers.

2.	Put in place a new contract between PB-KBB and the Estate to cover post bankruptcy work.  Please work with G. Nemec to develop the form of the contract that we want to propose to the cash committee.

3.	He also wants to have a discussion with regard to the pre-bankruptcy invoices, but he realizes he is an unsecrued creditor with respect to this work.

Lets you, Stuart and I chat by the end of the day to see where you are on this. 

Thanks,
Brian

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

	

Karen,  Please get with Mary Ogden.  She can retrieve the schedules for you from our legal files.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a brief of these contracts.  I can help you work through the agreements if needed.  Thanks.

Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.

Thanks for your help.
Karen

Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.  

Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!

Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.  Let me know when you get some time.

Gerald,

Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT, just
lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to the
Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season is
shot.........

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.

Mark,  I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.  Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.  I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal.

	Gerald,
	Generally there has been a gas sales agreement with ENA.  Given that this transaction was done as ENA, it may have been handled
	differently.  What contractual provisions exist for the gas delivered by NNG to ENA?

I left it with Leslie after I reviewed yesterday.

Does anyone have the termination list from yesterday, 12-12?  We need to get the updates sent out.

Thanks.

I don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  Eric, you might want to check with Ed and see if he has any insight.

Eric,
We need to get the physical gas delivery issue resolved.  TW is scheduled to deliver to ECS which was contracted
with ENA for a fixed price for each of the stations ( [Bisti & Bloomfield or Kachina] and Gallup ).  The total volume
for Dec.01 according to TW and my best determination at this time is 342,560 MMBtu which ENA has not scheduled 
reportedly because they do not have a counter-party that will transact.  

This gas volume and the resulting cash flow into ECS Compression Co. LLC is a large portion of the monthly cash
flow required to fund the billing expenses.  

Gallup Sta. - 81,605 mmbtu's (Annual Charge Conversion) appears to be a $2.35/mmbtu price for this year
                   25,521 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge) appears to be a $2.44/mmbtu price for the term
	     107,126 mmbtu's for the month with a resulting $2.37144/mmbtu blended price

Bloomfield - 110,240 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)

Bisti -         125,194 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)
                  342,560 mmbtu's for the month of Dec. to ECS

I'm not 100% sure of the pricing on these transactions but possibly with your information and Gerald Nemec's
input we can determine and confirm.

TK Lohman at TW called with a buyer for the Dec. 01 ECS gas.  Scott Walker w/ Richardson Products 817 810 9385
frequently buys TW's operational gas that is sold intra month.  The most direct method of handling the gas is to have
ENA sell the gas & the proceeds directly flow back to ECS (if that is possible).  ECS doesn't want the gas sale to 
roll into the ENA bankruptcy process.  Otherwise ENA would need to assign ECS the ability to sell the gas directly
but ECS would then need to execute a TW Pooling Agreement (or something) and there may be issues with ECS
marketing gas directly.  

Let me know what blanks you can fill in.
mk

We found no termination notice.

Please see attached.  Please note that that physical gas purchase and sale is as follows:

ECS Compression Company LLC receives the gas from TW under the CSA
ECS Compression Company LLC sells the gas to Enron Compression Services Company
Enron Compression Services Company sells the gas to ENA (Gallup) or to Enron Gas Marketing Corp. (Bisti/Bloomfield)

  

I would like to nominate OU's 16-13 defeat by OSU as the Most Humiliating Upset of the Year.  

http://espn.go.com/abcsports/columns/connolly_marc/2001/1212/1294802.html

At this point, I don't think any assignment to ECS solve any of these issues.  We still have to get approval for any cash outlaws from ECS since it is 100% owned by ENA.  Also assignment from a debtor entity to a non-debtor entity might require certain approvals from the Bankruptcy Ct. and the DIP financing.  I can look into it if it necessary, but does it really help the cash situation?

 
Gerald,
Since the agreements with Hubbard were executed by ENA (and not ECS)
is there some assignment from ENA to ECS that we should or need to look
at for post-petition business?  
 
Sounds like they are planning to not pay the delinquent bills but to make 
assurances for the billing going forward.  This is a BIG deal to these small
Cooperatives that we typically work with.  Our load generally represents a 
very large percentage of their total business and they have wholesale providers
that they have to pay.  A couple of our monthly bills could put these guys
into financial distress themselves.  
 
I need to find and read throught the contract with Midland Power before this
gets too far down the road.  I'm out today (Monday) and tomorrow dealing
with some personal stuff with my mom.  Call me tomorrow morning (9 - 10) or we can visit on Wednesday when I'm in the office.  
 
mk
 
 

Stuart, 

Ultimately we may have to decide if it is more advantageous to pay the pre-petition amounts due or put up whatever deposits/prepayments that may be required to give the utility "additional assurance" of payment of post-petition amounts.  Remember, however, that pre-petition payments will need to be considered in light of the relatively tight baskets imposed by the bankruptcy court and the DIP lenders.

Regards, 

Dave 

Chip/Dave, 

If you will recall, you had me check into whether Midland was a utility under the Bankruptcy Code.  Your thought was that past due amounts to "utilities" had special treatment under the law of bankruptcy.  Gerald and I communicated with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews & Kurth and concluded that Midland is likely a "utility" and that as such, would not be able to stop service for failure to pay pre-petition obligations.  Utilities, such as Midland, are however entitled to request additional assurance of payment.  Our first day bankruptcy order provides such additional assurance by definition, unless a utility counterparty objects in a writing sent to Steve Woods within 30 days of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy (December 2nd).

By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Steve whether he has received any such objection from Midland and, if none has been received to date, to notify myself and Gerald Nemec upon receiving any such objection. 

David Z. suggested that we wait until the expiration of the 30 day period (roughly January 2, 2002) and if nothing is received by that time, just pay invoices which relate to post-petition periods.  We must, however, pay all post petition invoices in a timely manner and it probably makes sense to pre-approve these.

Thanks 

Stuart 

Susan,  Could you look for and email me the following:

Storage Agreement with Montana Power 
Interruptible Storage Agreement with WBI
Transport Agreement with Trailblazer Pipeline Company (Think it was dated around 1995)

Sorry for the sketchy info, but that is all that I have.  Thanks.

Bruce,  Give me a call when you get a chance.  We have much to talk about in recruiting.  Let's see.......  Albert Hardy, Rodrique Wright, and now Marco Martin.  Unbelievable.  If we could only land Vincent Young.

Kellie,  Have you updated the transport list yet?

Here, Here,  I would like to second Ernie's sentiments.  We are very proud of you guys and hope that you stay safe.  Drop us a note if you can.

Lt. Bieraugel,

I doubt you are able to receive email at this time, but just in case you
are...............wanted to let you know that you are making the news!  Just
read an article in the USA Today online that lists your ship as one in the
Arabian Sea that has launched Tomahawks.  So I'm bragging about you to everyone
in my office....."My buddy Paul, as Chief Weapon Officer, is lobbing missiles at
the Taliban, he's pushing the button himself!"  I know you guys are well-trained
and just doing your job, but your college buddies are proud of you and the
entire country is behind you (90% approve the actions in a poll!).

So God bless and Godspeed, you get back safely to those four kids of yours!

Take care bud,
Ern

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

I still haven't received the final update.  This is the latest.

Gerald,

Attached is the most recent version - Wholesale East is still in process but Wholesale Central & West are in pretty good shape.  I'll forward another copy at the end of today.

Thanks,

Kellie,  Have you updated the transport list yet?

Do you have anything for HomeTown Communications Network.  Looking for a gas  contract dated 6/14/01

...but I was on the phone.  Do you need a contract?

No.  This must be the Pulp & Paper GTC to which they are referring.  They didn't specifically note it as a gas deal.  Thanks for your help.

No, there is a terminated Pulp & Paper GTC, but I can't find anything in Global or LiveLink for them for gas.  Should I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat?

Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Service=

the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,00=

Attached is a draft of the Dow Amendment.  I used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of August 8.  Date and prices are left blank for negotiation.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Stuart,  I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.  Please review attached.  The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept:

1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.

2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are.

 

Attached are my comments.  Obviously, I haven't reviewed the original lease so I am providing comments from a less than optimal vantage point.

Hey Gerald,

I was wondering if you can answer a question for me.  If you can't, no problem...

I recently completed a paper that compares electric compression to gas-fired compression.  I am presenting that paper next week at the Gas Machinery Research Council Annual Conference and Seminar.   I plan on submitting the paper to several industry journals in the hopes of getting it published.

How do I make sure the paper is protected from being copied by someone else and submitted under their own name?  Can I copyright the paper?

Thanks,

Chris,  Attached is the info I have on this deal.  My contact info is:

Gerald Nemec
Gerald, the ILL. atty. Chris Hilgert referred to is Chris Townsend -His number is 312-368-4039. The specific question is: can we utilize Com Ed for E service at Nicor's "Troy Grove" Facility? (Located near Troy Grove, ILL- approx 10 Miles North of the Town of La Salle, ILL) The Com Ed substation we would like to have power delivered at is approx 7 Miles N. of the facility near the town of Mendota, ILL.  

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation.

Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis II.  They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by the end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers again.  Later.

Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who cleans
your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we didn't
show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun? Do you

Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work, her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts, washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes, bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there. A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if you have questions.

Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all she

Gerald - 
This afternoon, the Compression team is headed to Chicago for a Friday meeting with Nicor.  We have not yet progressed to the point of providing Nicor a LOI.  Instead, one of the items they plan to discuss is the attached outline of the LOI in order to give Nicor an indication of what would be included if and when the deal progresses.  

Could you review the attached LOI Outline and provide any comments?

Bill,  Attached is the information we discussed.  I enjoyed talking with you today.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 

Keith is forwarding hard copies of the documents.  As soon as I recieve them, I will review, initial, and forward to you for execution.    

Gerald,

Do you know the status of the Assumption Parish documents?  Are we ready for Enron to execute?  

Rakhi
x3-7871

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

Hey Ern,  Sorry it took me awhile to get back with you.  As you can imagine, it is pretty crazy around here.  Yes, it has been very interesting around Enron these days.  I think we pull through, but I expect the stock to take a beating for awhile.  The media has been pounding us for the last couple of weeks.  

Saw George at the Colorado game.  Seems to be doing well.  George was definitely ready to get married, so I think he is really enjoying the married life.  Ran into a couple of old Wranglers including Carl Jackson.  Do you remember Kenny Reineger?  We saw him at the endzone club.  Also ran into Stacy......SAR!  She looks exactly the same.  

Haven't heard anything from Bieraugel.  I sure he is up to his eyeballs busy with kickin some Taliban butt.  How is life at FritoLay.  The economy effecting you guys any?

Man, I thought it was your job to keep these off-balance-sheet deals clean!  I
thought we had seen the bottom yesterday, but I guess the market is anticipating
additional debt downgrades.  I bought in at $37, and am considering the ol'
Texas double-down - get my average price down to $25 - but even that looks shaky
at the moment.  I trust that you guys will pull through............

What's going on?  Have you hooked up with George at any UT games?  Wonder how
married life is treating him, haven't heard from him.  Haven't  heard from Paul
since our last email, have you?

Take care,
Ern

I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a
little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the
chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like
broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.

Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to
Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all
the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will
let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a
hall pass from your better half.

      I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some
   stock today.  I think the punding you guys have taken is getting a
   little
   carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I
   think
   your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
   enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
   do.....................

      Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to
   go into my busy planning period, Sept-Nov, so not looking forward to
   that
   much.  Kids are doing well and two of my three start pre-school next
   week,
   so mama is relieved.

      Take care,

      Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
   little
      early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
   good
      time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

      It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
   last
      week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
   the new
      car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
   on
      Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

      Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
   him
      since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

           Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
   are
      flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
   (sp?), a
      place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
   there at
      about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
   to the
      downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
   of mine
      from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
   well.
      Are
      you game?

           Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
   getting
      into
           Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
   (281)
      772-9250.
           If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
   don't
      you just
           call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
   we'll
      ride
           over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
   seeing
      with me.
           My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
      wedding is
           at 7.

           Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

      Hotel Room Confirmation

           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Per our discussion.

Jeff, 

I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 

If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brian.

   

Attached is the draft.

 

Lisa,  I am fine with your changes.  The language that you highlighted in red should read "the Parties enter into a defintive agreement(s) for the compression services".  Please make the change.  Let me know if you need anything further.

Gerald -
Thanks.  As discussed earlier, I accepted all of your changes except the item in Section 14. 

In the meantime, we have reworked the language in Non-Binding Sections 12 & 13 to further clarify the power rates and terms.  Please review.  
 << File: Nicor LOI (Nov-7-01).doc >> 
Also, the Term language (in red) in Binding Section 1 below seems to give NICOR an out and seems to contradict the exclusivity clause?  Please explain.

Term.  This Agreement shall remain in force and effect until the earliest to occur of the following events:  (i) an entity or entities other than the Parties enter into a definitive agreement(s) for the compression services; or (ii) April 1, 2002 (the "Term").  The provisions of Section 3, Confidentiality, shall survive any termination of this Agreement, as necessary for them to expire according

Sounds like you have been busy.  Work sucks.  Everybody is really stunned and depressed.  Plus, I have been sick since Sunday.  I have missed a couple of days of work.  Not a good week for the G.    Sorry to be such a bummer.  Anyway, glad that you like Lucinda.  She does good work.  We'll catch up this weekend.

Gerald, sorry I haven't replied back. It's my busy season at work. You know
she came last Saturday. She did an awesome job!!! Thank you so much for the
info. I was doing a volunteer home repair project, so I didn't get to meet
her. But, I'm sure next Saturday I will impress her with my expertise of
the Spanish language (like I impressed the citizens of  Spain, or at least
the people at Joy Enslava!)

How's work? I hope things start working out. Between you, my dad and many
others, a lot of money is being lost. Dad has to exercise 2,000 shares by
end of the year and another 3,000 in January. He's lost over a million
dollars! Hopefully, we can all get together this weekend and drink our
sorrows away!!! After all this time, I'm still waiting to get an offer from
the other side of the company. I think it's around the corner though. Talk
to you soon.

                    Gerald.Nemec@
Her name is Lucinda.  Can't remember her husbands name, but I call him
Lucinda's husband.  The number is 713-697-1626.  In case that doesn't work,
her husband's work number is 281-970-2020.  I pay her $50 every time she
comes, which is every two weeks.  She does it all.  Mops, vacuums, dusts,
washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes,
bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband
speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want
to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If
she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and
take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on
the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there.
A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if
you have questions.

   Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all
   she
   does for you. You pay $50 per cleaning, don't you? Thanks! We will have
   to
   get together this weekend.

                       Gerald.Nemec@
   Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.
   The
   GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis
   II.
   They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by
   the
   end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers
   again.
   Later.

      Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
      cleans
      your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we
   didn't
      show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun?
   Do
      you
      have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.

It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.  Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.  I revised the transaction sheet to reflect this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris,  Attached are driving directions to Nicor's Troy Grove site.  Per our discussions, please verify whether the site is in Illinois Power's territory.

The Troy Grove driving directions from Chicago:

Thus location is off of Rte 251 one mile South of 52.

Attached are the consent to assignment letters. We will need two executables of each.  Let me know if you will be the one sending these out for execution.

  

What is the status on the assignment letters assigning the LGS Natural Gas Co. and Entergy New Orleans contracts to Bridgeline?

Robert,  The original contribution agreement called for Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. to acquire consent for these assignments.  They were required to use "all reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents".  To the extent they did not do so, ENA should not be liable for the $25,000 per month.  I assume Hugh Connett at Bridgeline is the proper person contact person at Bridgeline.  What is the current status of this $25,000 per month bill.  Has Bridgeline invoiced us?

Attached is the structure with my comments.  Concerning the earlier question.  It is not clear under Texas law whether the surface rights by themselves are sufficient to convery the right to use property for gas storage.  Thus the rights should be leased from both the surface owner and the mineral owner to be sure.  I revised the transaction sheet to reflect this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached are David's insurance comments.  I agree with his mark-ups.  Feel free to contact David directly to discuss.

Gerald,
My comments noted.  A few points:   as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct.  BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services.  I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).
Call me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further.   

Thx,

David

Please see attached I added language concerning the firmness of that portion converted to a fixed price.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

FYI

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Art,  Per our phone conversation, attached is the revised language for Section 4.4 of the Master Firm Agreement.  Please review and if acceptable, we will prepare executables and forward for signature.
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section 4.4 shall only allow for offset, set off, or recoupment between Company and Customer, excluding Customer's PNM Gas Services division."

Gerald,

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado ("PSCo") and Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power ("CLF&P").  I apologize for the delay.  Our comments
are as follows:

Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.

2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change "may" to "shall".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo
or CLF&P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose
that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the
parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited
to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering
Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the
Agreement.

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
"establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice."

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase "or deemed to be repeated".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&P is
authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.
Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&P in the
respective Agreements.

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert "provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, "which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld".
Please modify this provision accordingly.

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard.

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:

	"Material Adverse Change" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
"Credit Support Provider" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below "BBB-" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
"Baa3", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.

Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement

Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated
above regarding the PSCo Agreement, with the following exceptions:

Section 4.2. Triggering Event.  The dollar levels near the end of the
Section should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make each
$75,000,000.

Section 4.7.  Collateral Requirement.  Similarly, the dollar trigger levels
in this provision should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make
each $25,000,000.

Except for the foregoing, please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement
consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above.
Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes,
you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize these Agreements.

Rudwell,  Attached is the guaranty.  Please print out 1 copy for Randy's signature.

 

I am fine with the language.  We will prepare executables.

Gerald, I spoke with our lawyer Robert Clark and the following 
is his additions to your language.  Please let me know if it 
is acceptable. If so, please prepare executables and forward 
for signatures. 
Thanks  Art Avalos 
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Section 
4.4 shall only allow for offset, set off, or recoupment between Company 
and Customer, but not between Company and Customer's PNM Gas Services division." 

  

Please review.

Attached is the final letter version.  I am OK with the wiring instructions.

 

 << File: Wiring Instructions.doc >>  << File: Post closing Survey Price Adjustment.doc >> 

I agree with your summary.

Scott,

I talked to Gerald after our telecon as you requested ----- here's the summ=
ary:

I repeated to Gerald my reply when you asked my opinion regarding the best =
way to approach Clark.  To reiterate for clarity, I suggest that Scott tell=
 Clark we are not satisfied with BCCK's management of activities related to=
 field construction and construction management activities.  If you (Scott)=
 feel it is appropriate or necessary to offer details, the general reasons =
are: (1) Poor communication leading to schedule delays and/or cost increase=
s; (2)  A very casual (and consequently unacceptable) approach to improving=
 the overall project schedule as necessary to achieve a 15 December 2001 in=
-service date; and, (3) Unilateral decision-making by BCCK without the cons=
ent of all Crescendo partners having the same effect as (1) above.  As a re=
sult, Scott and Ken mutually agree and have directed Dave to take a lead ro=
le in completing all construction, testing, commissioning, start-up and rel=
ated activities.  It is important to stress to Clark, that, while Dave and =
his delegates have primary authority and responsibility for completing thes=
e activities, it will not be done at the exclusion of BCCK.  To the contrar=
y, Crescendo requests and expects BCCK's full and open participation. =20

Though the contract does not explicitly address this action, Gerald agreed =
that since Enron wears the vast majority of all types of risk in this proje=
ct, it is reasonable for us (Enron) to take action in order to protect our =
interests.  In addition, Ken Krisa agrees with the need and reasons for mak=
ing this move, establishing strong support (though not, perhaps, unanimous)=
 at the Crescendo LLC level.  Because the contract does not provide specifi=
cally for this action, our options -- in increasing order of severity with =
regard to impact upon BCCK and the potential for unpleasant reactions by sa=
me -- are:

Most Productive, Least Destructive to Project and Relationships:

1.  Take the direct approach to Clark as I described above.

Plan B:

2.  Submit a change order under the appropriate section of the Contract cha=
nging BCCK's scope of work and informing them of the change in management p=
hilosophy and leadership.

Desperation Tactic:

3.  Declare the agreement in default due to non-performance and take over a=
ll activities contemplated by the agreement.

(Gerald --- How did I do???)

Dave

I am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.  

Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?

see below is the template.
lisa

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Judy
Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,
Judy

Clement,  Attached is the form of guaranty we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Ken,  Attached is the form of guaranty from Enron Corp.  This guaranty is currently be routed for approval.  

 

Ken, Below is the revised language for the restriction on activities paragraph in the Cash Sale Form

The Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.  Additionally, Buyer shall erect and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a suitable chain-link fence between Vendor's retained adjacent property and the purchased Property.

Keith,  Could you look at this form and scrub it for Louisiana law issues. 
Gerald,

Attached is a draft of the agreement for the ROWs requested by Bridgeline.  Would you please look it over and make any necessary changes?

For your review.

 

Chris,  Attached is the document to which Russell and I have agreed.  Next step is for us to get signed and fax to Russell.  Do you have the tract descriptions that Gulf forwarded?  Does Dave?

 

Ken,  We are in receipt of your revised sale form.  We will review.  I also need the following items by today to fully complete my review.

1.  Any comments you have to the restriction language I proposed.
2.  Draft of the Board Resolution you added to the Act of Sale.
3.  Any other comments you have.

Please forward this information ASAP.

FYI,  The latest.

Attached is a revised version of the Act of Sale and a redline of same

Dan,  This is the only transport agreement I found in that directory.

 

Chris,  The letter was signed and faxed to Gulf at approximately 5 pm today.

Lisa,  My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.  Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as "ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).

Gerald - 
We are planning to provide a revised Term Sheet to Unocal sometime tomorrow.  Can you please review the attached revised Term Sheet and provide any comments.  It is not that different from the initial Term Sheet you reviewed and approved in September.

I am trying to leave the office by 12 tomorrow.  Any comments ASAP would be appreciated.  Upon receipt of comments, I will forward to Bill Howell.

 

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

	1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
	2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.

	4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.  Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's 40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these licenses has been filed.  

Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re: the
sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .  As
I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above transaction
whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need the
following transaction information:

*	When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
*	Which licenses where part of that transaction?
*	Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
transaction date?
*	Which stations are constructed/operating?

As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the FCC.
To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday at
the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Chris,
Wanted to let you know that the investment in Kachine/Gallup is $1,775,144.85, not $1,742,855.41.  This will reduce the net gain to $324,158.15.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Karen

Karen,

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calculations below).  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will deliver you the signed letter when I get it along with the detailed calculations.

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

Eric,  Texaco Exploration and Production, Inc. owns the other 60%.  The LP is governed by a management committee with two member from Enron and two from Texaco.

I can be your contact for Louisiana Resources.  However, as I stated earlier, I need to know which Louisiana Resources you are talking about.  Is it Louisiana Resources Company or Louisiana Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership.

For Bridgeline the contact would be Robert D. Morgan.  His phone number is 713-345-6374.

Gerald, this is just to follow up on the voicemail message I left for you
this afternoon.  Can you please provide me with contact information for reps
from both Louisiana Resources and Bridgeline.  The transfer of control
applications to be filed with the FCC require signatures from reps from both
parties to the transaction.  We will need this info before we can file the
applications.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Thanks Gerald, this info is helpful.  Do you know who owns the other 60%
equity interest in Bridgeline, and how the LP is structured to give Enron
50% control with only 40% interest?

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into

Attached are my Louisiana counsel's comments to our ROW form.  I agree with his changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to "rights of way" or "easement", to
"servitude" or "sevitude of right of use".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms "easement" or "right of way".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

The final sign off from Reliant legal.  I will prepare the executables and get them to Eva.  

The Bd resolutions and the post closing letter agmt are fine.  The Act
of Sale contains 2 typos: 1) the Tax ID# for Reliant Energy Gas Storage,
LLC is 76-0697568, 2) the 3 million number has one too many zeros after

Per our discussion, please review and provide comments asap.

Here are Gulf's proposed changes to match the concept discussed earlier this afternoon.

For your review is the draft Construction Expedition Letter per our
discussions Monday.

 <<GulfExpediteLetter2.doc>>

Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  

It was sitting on Haedicke's desk.  Eva, is going to pick it up and bring it to you for signature.

Thank you, but no I have not seen the new resolution.  Could it be with Redmond or Haedicke?

Attached is the latest version of the PA with my changes redlined.  Sorry for the delay.

  

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

 

FYI,  My Fla. counsel's comments to our letter.

Gerald,

Attached are my edits to the letter. Daphne will prepare a version that is
without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read. You can
compare the two to see exactly what I have done.

My edits are in blue. Comments are in bold blue and bracketed.

ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can
get. But it isn't a deal because it is all illusory.

They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain (no recourse if
they don't) in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount
that they think is fair (that is the only standard - they have no
responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount).

In general, Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can
stop construction if they don't get it. If our existing agreements clearly
provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load, and those provisions are
linked to the costs of construction (so no further contribution from ECS was
contemplated in those agreements), then I think that ECS can hold them to
the deal.

We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may
have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their
decision and Gulf's incorrect representation (upon which we relied) that our
facility was in a territory that they could serve. I think (but have not
researched the point) that ECS would have standing as a customer. I believe
that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to
our situation.

However, if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be
no issue for the PSC to decide. As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS.
If ECS accepts the change (unless under protest) then a court or the
commission will probably consider the matter moot. I'm not sure about the
legal effect of "signing under protest" in this context but can do some
research if you think that useful.

In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of
this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now
modified. I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean
a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief. I don't
have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that
should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written
and signed.

More later. Call when you can.

Bill

Keith,  Please draft the letter and forward for my review.  Could you also forward the language for Item #1as you revised it?  Thanks.

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

Lisa, Your changes look fine to me.  I added the sentence to make it clear that ECS would not be owning and operating that portion of the equipment.  It wasn't clear to me from the section which indicate we will be arranging for the installation of the compressors.

Gerald,
Thanks for your comments.  I've made a few revisions (hightlighted in BLUE); in particular, I've clarified the Capital Expenditures Section 4 (we want to differentiate the transmission line from the remainder of the capital estimates).  We are still working on the items in red and in yellow.
 << File: Oakhill LOI (10-3-01) Lisa.doc >> 
One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence "Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term"?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

Thanks, Lisa

Lisa,  I made significant revisions to this form.  Please review and lets discuss.

 << File: OakhillLOI(10-3-01).doc >> 

Lisa,  I made significant revisions to this form.  Please review and lets discuss.

 

Barry,  Attached are the drafts we discussed yesterday.  Please give me a call to discuss.

  

Attached is the confirm and GTC for the Wellhead purchase with Keep Whole language that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions.

  

Dave,  I made a few slight changes to the agreement.  Nothing substantive, just to clarify and catch some typos.  I am OK with this form.  We need to make sure the Universal signs any schedules to this agreement which specify the operating parameters of the units.  Also, David Marshall will need to review the insurance section and address how we handle their self insurance issues.

 

Keith,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing Enron's use of the property.  No such uses should be found.  What specifically are they looking for with respect to this item.  Finally, any word on the title check with respect to item #3.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Ask them to print and sign two copies.

 

Mark and Dave,  Please print out two copies of each and execute all four.  The closing statements need to be printed on ENA Letterhead.  Sign all four and fax to Don Baldridge.  Put all four originals in the Fedex to me for initial.  I have asked Don to obtain execution of NBP's side and fax back to me.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I responded to Frank about 20 minutes ago.

  Can you please send a response to Franck, Scott about Tennessee, I really need to get these out.

Shane:

The Gulf South TPA's are ready for pickup.  I have not yet received a response to my inquiries regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA's from Gerald Nemec.

Scott

FYI
Adjusted purchase price s/b $209,159,347.
Build up of this number is
$204,000,000 purchase
+$4,000,705 estimated true-up
+$1,158,642 Friday final settlement

Number does not include the estimated 109K due from Westport.

The Payment schedule goes like this

NBP owes $1,158,642 through the true-up
ENA owes $1,937,200 throught the exec contract

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.  
Thanks.  

 

Frank,  Sandi Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help.

Gerald:

I just spoke with Shane Lakho again regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA.  She said that it may have been your predecessor, Sandy Brayband(?), who was involved in this deal, but that the terms had been approved by ENA-Legal for ENA and ENA-Upstream.  Can you confirm this and let me know?  Thanks.

Scott L. Franck

Larry,  What is the status of this permit?

The permit application is set for public hearing on August 29 at 10:00
a.m. in Baton Rouge.  I will forward a copy of the public notice upon
receipt.  The purpose of the public hearing is to allow any interested
parties to make comments or present evidence on the application.  Joe
Ball prefers that Bridgeline not present any evidence or testimony at
the hearing.  Joe considers the application to be evidence of everything
needed to approve the permit.  Accordingly, I do not intend to present
any evidence at the hearing.  Our role will be to observe any comments
or protests by interested parties.  Joe Ball will advise if there are
any issues raised at the hearing that require a response and we can
supplement the record in writing.  This approach is preferable because
it does not subject anyone involved with the project to
cross-examination at the hearing and it affords us time to make an
informed and calculated response (if needed).

David and Robert: considering the importance of this project to your
respective companies, I would encourage you both to attend if possible.
I will defer to David as to whether Harry Allison should attend.

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

Harry,  We have been using Bill Bryant and the Katz Kutter law firm to represent ECS' interest in the territorial dispute between Gulf Power and WFEC.  I forwarded your email to him and asked for his input.  Attached is his input.  I think his suggestion about a meeting with all parties involved is a good one.  Let me know what you think.

Gerald,

See the attached schedule for Docket 010441, the Gulf/WFEC dispute.

There is no schedule yet for the Gulf rate hearing. We expect that in early
October and I will forward it to you.

You asked about the effect of intervention in the rate case on the
territorial dispute. In addressing this question it is useful to know that
the FPSC rate hearing intervention rules are very liberal        (Enron can
intervene at any time) and that the rate case will not proceed rapidly. For
procedural purposes, a prompt intervention decision is not necessary.

Also, I think that Gulf has the stronger position in the territorial
dispute. Because an Enron intervention in the rate case could confuse the
staff and raise questions from WFEC, I think it best from ECS's perspective
to await a decision in the territorial dispute before petitioning for
intervention.

I've reviewed the questions in Harry Kingerski's e-mail that you forwarded.
Preliminarily, I note two corrections. First, we expect a decision in the
territorial dispute in early December, not November. Second, Harry said
that;

      "Gulf proposed surcharge treatment for the capital costs of Smith
earlier this year, but eventually withdrew the application because the PPA
it was trying to get in place, whereby Southern would take ownership of the
plant and sell energy and capacity back to Gulf, drew a lot of flack".

I don't know if it matters, but Susan Clark was told that Gulf withdrew the
application because the discovery order in the docket would have required
the release of Southern Company strategic planning material that Southern
considered very confidential. Withdrawal was preferable to disclosure. (I
recognize that this may be only Gulf's "spin" on the withdrawal and they may
have withdrawn for exactly the reason Harry suggests.)

The strategic questions posed in Harry's e-mail are complex and involve more
than one Enron entity. His questions defy a prompt response, at least from
us. We suggest that it would be useful to convene a meeting in Houston,
including us and a representative from each wholly-owned and potentially
affected Enron entity. That would facilitate the development and
handicapping of a regulatory stance that is best for Enron. Susan's
experience as a Florida Commissioner for nine years (and General Counsel for
years before that) is useful in understanding the factors that inform
staff's recommendations as well as a Commissioner's decisions in this
context. (I've attached Susan's information.)

Let me know what you would like us to do.

Hi, Stephanie,

I wanted to check where we are on the ISDA ... we sent you a proposal at the
end of Sept, and you and I have exchanged a couple of emails since then, but
overall I believe that the ball is still ' in your court'.  Is this correct?

Hello, Stephanie,

I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your email/attachments
fo 24 July.

Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the address
details and a few other similar minor items.

Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.

Ms. Panus,

A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or
e-mails.

I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me
know if they are acceptable.

They are as follows:

Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex
A.

We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at
a latter date.

Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other
trading houses of Enron's size.

Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.

Thank you

Gary Ross

Wendy,
I think the amendment only brought the collateral threshold to zero for trades after Dec. 31, 2001.  There was no mention in the amendment of the new ENMAX entity.  We sent a draft ISDA for ENMAX Energy Marketing, Inc. but have not heard anything from them.

Stephanie,

I think this might be your matter.  Could you advise Wendy as to your findings.

Thanks.

Susan,

Could you please follow up with the above referenced counterparty to see where they are on our amendment to the existing ISDA?  This amendment provides for ENMAX Energy Marketing Inc. as a new contracting party under the agreement.

Remember daily vol is implied vol divided by sqrt of time or 16 in this case.

How do you like your new digs?

hey, how are you? can you send me an example of how you callculate var on contracts.

Greg,

Good morning. I really apologize about yesterday. The webmaster decided to
tighten up the web address and it is now:

www.earthsat.com/misc/bridge

login: bridge
password: cajun

It all should work fine now. Sorry for the confusion on our part.

Take care,

Matt

Matt,

Do you know if we're set up yetI caould not get int6o the page today.

Thanks

Greg

No, I can set you up on the web this afternoon and we can call this next
week your free trial!

I'll send info to our web support right now. It should be up late this
afternoon or tomorrow morning.

Let's do this:

Please use all lower case, since it will be cap-sensitive.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow, but I'll have someone checking my e-mail
if you have any problems with the website.

Thanks again!!

Matt

Matt,

The contract looks fine, my only question is do we have to wait till the
20th to get web access?  Just explain to me when we can begin receiving the
service.

Thanks again,

Greg Schockling

Greg,

Good afternoon. I'm attaching a contract agreement, which includes a
discount for the smaller number of users. Please let me know if you have any
questions or concerns regarding the contract.  Otherwise, please sign and
fax back to (301)231-5246 or 5020 at your earliest convenience.

Thanks again!

Matt

That sounds good thanks Matt

Greg

Greg,

Unfortunately not. That service is a hybrid that we offer to both our
clients and theirs. The cost for the service is $6600/year. You may want to
check with PIRA on your arrangement with them, but typically this is sold
separately.

I'll put a contract together for you with the basic, noon, and an applied
discount to account for your group's smaller size.

Thanks!

Matt

Matt,

Heres what I think we need here at Bridgeline, the basic service plus the
noon update, 1 page.  I also had a question, does this package include the
forecast on storage from pira?  We are a Pira client already so I just need
clarification on that.

Let me know then we'll finalize.

Thanks very much.

Greg Schockling

Greg,

No problem. I'm attaching this morning's basic for you. If you want, we can
keep those products coming to you regularly this week as a free trial until
you've decided.

Take care,

Matt

Thanks Matt I will get back with you later today, I think the basic package
with the noon update will be what we're looking at.  Just wighing our
options.

Thanks

Greg Schockling

Greg,

Good morning. Enron was paying for a pretty large weather package from us,
so it may be a steep cost to get the entire package. Were there just certain
products you were using? For example, our basic package, which includes the
1-15 day maps, the 16-city forecasts, the 30-day outlook, and phone access
is $450/month. The noon update would be an additional $150/month. Since you
are a smaller group, I can apply a discount as well...perhaps as much as
20%. Let me know what products you were using from the site and I can put
together a package and quote for you fairly quickly. I'm attaching our
standard price sheet for your reference as well.

My name is Greg Schockling and I work for Bridgeline Gas Marketing, a

energy weather via Enron and effective the 5th we stopped receiving it.  I
was wondering what you wouyld charge for us to pick up the service.  Weare a

continue the service.

Can you quote me what the cost would be to continue the service.  My phone

Shares of Independent Power=20
Producers and Traders Fall=20

By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20

  <http://secure.scientech.com/images/spacer.gif>

[News item from Reuters] Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an=
d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday, send=
ing shares of independent producers and traders falling. The downturn was t=
riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of a financing arr=
angement used by Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) which prompted unwelcome compariso=
ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 (SEC) into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos. (NYSE: WMB).=
=20

Analysis: Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th=
e recently hard-hit independent power producers (IPPs), more unwanted bad n=
ews has once again plagued this sector. In addition to Dynegy and Williams,=
 companies such as Calpine, Mirant and AES have had significant news in the=
 past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los=
ses, lowered credit ratings, softening energy commodity prices, and questio=
ns of accounting practices. Let's take a look at the latest developments fo=
r these companies.=20

Dynegy shares closed at $28.79 per share, down by about 4 percent, as the m=
arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegy's use of off-balance-sheet=
 transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c=
ash flow and net income. Project Alpha, as it was called, was blessed by Dy=
negy's former auditor, Andersen, and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers=
. Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of=
 business practices that Enron engaged in. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph=
asized, "The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w=
ith a long-term source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit=
." Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved, Dynegy sto=
ck was not used to back the loans, and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn=
egy's financial reports last year. In 2000 the company reported "unrealized=
 gains" of $354 million generated by valuing derivative contracts, increasi=
ng the gap between its profit and cash flow. Trading companies include the =
estimated value for "derivative" contracts they use for future buying and s=
elling of commodities in net income as "unrealized gains." A special purpos=
e entity (SPE) was formed in April of last year with a $300-million loan fr=
om Citigroup Inc. The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called=
 DMT Supply LP, in which Dynegy held a stake. According to Dynegy, during t=
he first nine months of operation, DMT bought gas from the entity at below-=
market prices and resold the gas at a profit. But during future years of th=
e project scheduled to end in 2006, DMT will buy gas at above-market gas pr=
ices, generating unrealized losses. By arranging transactions in this manne=
r, Dynegy was able to lower its 2001 tax bill by $80 million. But according=
 to WSJ, higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho=
se assigned to cash transactions which creates a "disconnect" between repor=
ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice.=20

Williams shares also dropped by 4.5 percent on Wednesday to close at $23.08=
 per share on news from WSJ, which reported that the SEC is looking into th=
e company's third-quarter results. In reaction, Williams clarified that it =
had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform=
ation concerning the company's 2001 third-quarter results but was told afte=
r a review that no financial adjustments were needed. Williams' spokesperso=
n Jim Gipson said, "We received an informal, confidential request for infor=
mation by the SEC in early February about our third-quarter 10Q. They asked=
 a couple of questions, we responded in writing, they called back in seven =
days and said no amendment to the third-quarter results was required." Gips=
on emphasized that, "We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t=
he SEC." Williams reported a third-quarter net income of $221.3 million, up=
 from $176.5 million, or 27 cents a share, earned in the same quarter one y=
ear ago. The quarter included a one-time charge of $71 million for the comp=
any's investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group. On Mar=
ch 7, Williams announced it had taken a $2.1-billion charge in the fourth q=
uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications. =
Williams reported a loss of $477.7 million for the fourth quarter.=20

Calpine shares were down 6.26 percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n=
ews that Moody's had downgraded Calpine's unsecured debt from Ba1 to B1, al=
ong with a negative ratings outlook. Approximately $12.4 billion of long-te=
rm debt instruments are affected. This follows a March 29 report, when the =
company disclosed that it will restate 2001 earnings after the company disc=
overed that emission-reduction credits it had purchased last year were not =
actually available. In a press release, Calpine said 2001 earnings would be=
 lowered by $11.5 million after tax from the $659.6 million reported on Jan=
. 31. The restatement will drop 2001 diluted earnings per share after extra=
ordinary items by 3 cents a share, to $1.87.=20

Moody's sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine'=
s high leverage, limited financial flexibility, and substantial ongoing cap=
ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced build-out program. Ca=
lpine's debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin=
ues its development of committed projects. While Calpine's total electric s=
ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants, it is expe=
cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions. Moody's anticipated =
that lower spark spreads (the difference between electric and fuel prices) =
will lower in the near term. Moody's warned that the negative outlook refle=
cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpine's liquidity pos=
ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations. Calpine=
 plans to fund completion of 22 gas-fired power projects and 2 project expa=
nsions during 2002 and 2003. Moody's also assigned a Ba3 rating to Calpine'=
s $2 billion of senior secured credit facilities. According to Moody's, the=
 Ba3 rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpine's collateral p=
ackage. A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpine's equity in=
terests in Saltend and nine U.S. power plants. A principal part of the coll=
ateral package is Calpine's natural-gas properties, which may be subject to=
 fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices. Moody's =
claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven.=20

Mirant also continues to experience hard times. Its shares were down 6.21 p=
ercent to close at $13.60 per share. Although yesterday's downturn may have=
 largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector, Mirant has been=
 involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to=
 try to shore up its balance sheet. On April 1 it was reported that Mirant =
has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl=
and up for sale. Queensland's government-owned CS Energy, currently 40-perc=
ent owner of Kogan Creek, is reported to be a potential buyer, as are MIM a=
nd Macarthur Coal. In a separate transaction announced on March 27, Cleco a=
greed to buy Mirant's 50-percent interest in a 725-megawatt power plant the=
 companies are building in northeastern Louisiana. The merchant power plant=
 is owned by a joint venture between the two companies. Cleco said it would=
 assume Mirant's $19.5-million equity commitment and pay $48 million to ret=
ire Mirant's project debt. Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co=
mbination of new common stock and debt.=20

AES has also fallen on tough times. Although the company's stock was up yes=
terday to close at $8.96 per share, the company continues to struggle. Earl=
y this week, AES sent a shockwave through the U.K. market when it announced=
 its decision to put its 363 MW Fifoots Point coal-fired power plant locate=
d in Wales into receivership. The recommissioning of Fifoots in late-1999 w=
as funded with a $214.5-million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche =
Bank. Richard Hill, joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London, who is=
 charged with selling the asset, says Fifoots has some GBP80 million of non=
-recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet =
to be fully determined. Similar to the U.S. market, wholesale prices in the=
 U.K. reportedly have collapsed by 30 percent after the launch of last spri=
ng's new bilateral trading system. Accordingly, one report claims at least =
a dozen project loans are either in technical default, have broken their co=
venants, or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio.=20

In other AES-related news this week it was announced that GE would be purch=
asing AESGener's 40-percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion=
 de Energia Electrica (Sigen) services company for an undisclosed amount. G=
E already owned 60 percent of the joint venture. AESGener, controlled by AE=
S, posted losses of Pesos $5,027mil in 2001 compared to a profit of Pesos $=
2,275mil in 2000. Operating results were down by 12.5 percent to Pesos $70,=
241mil on sales declining 23.8 percent to Pesos $347,009mil. The performanc=
e of AES' Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes, and selling o=
ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses. Rece=
ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company =
will continue to divest in non-electric assets and assets not based in Chil=
e.=20

The fallout of the Enron debacle, lowered credit ratings, and weak commodit=
y prices are providing a 1-2-3 blow that has many energy companies on the r=
opes struggling to make the bell. The companies are aggressively working to=
 put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales, p=
ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary write-offs. But as qui=
ckly as these companies' fortunes have nosedived, they can rise once again.=
 Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world.=20

hey, send me that easter picture again

SOCCER IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE OLYMPICS.

Get on the band wagon for soccer:  from the Washington Post....."Now the 
time is right. Because 1) Soccer fever is sweeping the country like malaria. 
And 2) We can get a short-term lease on a quality vehicle. And that's good, 
considering we're in a single-elimination situation, and we play 83-time 
winner Germany on Friday. Not to put too fine a point on it, but many 
Germans rank soccer behind only "full scale war" as the favorite sport of 
the country. (Hey, how about France, huh? Talk about gagging on the fromage! 
Three games, no goals. Au revoir, Pierre. Isn't it just like the French to 
go out early and leave it up to us to beat the Germans?)"

Ed,
    Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. 
 
 Duke/Centana 
  Money wires will be complete on April 1.  The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1.  I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. 

[Parks, Joe]  Ponderosa Energy Partners
 I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant.   I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where  I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over.
 
Pace Energy
I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000.
 
General Land Office.
I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal dealsheet for the natural gas volumes.

o:\gas structuring\centana_duke\CIPCO Payment Request(escrow)
You will also find the other request associated with Centana.
Great.  Can you e-mail the cash request you sent to doug?

The answer is yes. Money was received Friday and Doug should be getting approval to send the other out today.

I assume ENA gets credited with the oney wired in on Friday re Centana.

What's the status on the wire going out today.  Do you have a cash request completed?

Let me know this morning.  Thanks.

What is going on with Centana.  We have not prepared a wire to go out today and also, we need details about the money wired in to us on Friday.  Who gets credited with this money.

Stuart, I have attached a cash flow worksheet that will walk you through the calculations. The file is located 0:\gas structuring\Centana_Duke.  You will also find other related materials associated with the transaction.

FYI

Joe Parks just completed the sale of the gas in storage at the Centana Facility.  Below you will see confirmation of our receipt of the sales price.  Joe will send to me (and I can forward to any interested party) the methodology for the sales price calculation.  Of this amount, approximately $225,000 will be escrowed (these are for pre-petition obligations under the storage agreement with Centana) subject to some future resolution.  My understanding is that Ed McMichael and his team will be evaluating what to do with the Centana Storage Agreement (accept or reject).

He is out of the office until about 11:30. My gut is that this is not
going to happen until tomorrow or monday. 

I left a message for Mike Richards to see if I could get the ball
rolling. He was on the phone. Have you had a chance to speak with Greg?

GO Doug Money.

You have approval to submit a request to the cash committee via Doug Sewell.

Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today...

 

 

 

Simple thoughts.....

 

US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold.....

 

It's not the other way around.

 

The world is losing confidence.  Everyday we get more terrorist activity around

the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....)

 

 Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world want

their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in the

States, sell the USD and buy their home currency.

 

US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part

that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods

only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month....

 

And where are we importing from.....

 

China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product

sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China......

compliments from Mark....  China has a competitive advantage, and trade rules

will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure

adjusts...... say in 25 years......

 

Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe must

be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... growth

in many industries in Europe is from the US. How can anybody in Brussels think

that a trade surplus with the US almost equal to China's (and one that is

larger than Japan's...) is a proper economic condition.......   As I said on

Tuesday.... I believe that the purchasing power parity level for the EUR is up

over $1.0800. (this is based on some long term thoughts.... that the old DEM

for PPP was 1.80 against the USD....)

 

The EUR is undervalued by 12.5%. That's why I think it's funny that European

politicians and the press feel that the EUR is strong up here the .9500 - .9600

area.

 

If a few people in the Bush administration start thinking that the US trade

picture needs to change...... you may have heard the last utterance of anyone

saying they want a strong USD.......

 

The US current account deficit in Q1 2002 was $112.5 bln....  So the US has to

attract $37.50 bln per month to keep this in balance......   to do so either

asset prices need to go lower or the USD has to go lower......  both is

happening.....

 

Well, the US trade deficit is getting closer to 4.5%  of GDP.  Just the

deficit.... and just extrapolate that for the CA deficit.......

 

So the EUR just popped up over .9600 and a boatload of stops were just done

into the .9625-30.  And now will have settled in at .9610. There are no

retracements in the EUR, just quiet periods of consolidation.

 

Until we get a screaming need to own US equities..... there appears to be no

need to own USD, and no retracement of the EUR.

 

Japan's trade surplus with the US..... $6.8 bln.  The game continues.....

USD/YEN 123.50 and no Bank of Japan...... I think, it would not be in the best

interest for the Japanese to be seen intervening right after this monster of a

trade deficit.

 

Japan overnight announced that their May trade surplus rose 715% y/y.......

Anything that climbs over 700 % is not normal...... most of Japan's trade

surplus with the rest of Asia rose 626%......

 

But every month,  Japanese authorities will need to vacuum up about $7 bln USD

just to keep the YEN stable against the USD,  as the current imbalance in trade

creates pressures for a firmer YEN.......  Who knows, maybe  a few voices in

Asia could clamor....  that the YEN is too weak.....

 

Bank of Japan foreign reserves in USD is over $400 bln these days and climbing,

(I think $406 bln in April and $419 bln in May)........ Maybe Japan will

someday dollarize........

 

Canada's trade surplus with the world is up 11.0% to $5.2 bln. Automotive

exports... the key.  The CAD trade surplus with the US was $8.2 bln and a

deficit with the rest of the world at $3.0 bln. (The US commerce department has

the CAD surplus at $4.1 bln....)

 

SGD at 1.7775.... firmest level since last October. It's moving on it's own, no

sympathy move with the YEN.... so either the YEN has to play catch-up or the

YEN is going to weaken against the rest of Asia....

 

Thai baht is also firm at 42.00 against the USD.  Korean won still at 1210.

Asia definitely looks better with the US trade deficit.

 

Venezuelan bolivar a record low at 1305 to the USD, since May 1 the VEB has

devalued 52%.   Not much more to say.....

 

Everyone have a great day....... the above thoughts are for your reading

pleasure. Any questions call me. All the best.

This is the latest and greatest from centana. Are you ok with this,  will you review?

i think this is the latest so lets work off this....i will call after i
talk with legal
                    Michael S.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   

Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.

(See attached file: StorageLeaseLetterAgreement3-13-02.DOC)

Chip,
	I just want to follow up my voicemail. If you can get with me by the end of the day or first thing tomorrow, I would appreciate it. I am trying to get the Centana Storage resolved and need your opinion/approval on an issue.

Thanks
Joe

You need to let me know if you want to sell volumes. I have to find a market.  Nominations are due Thursday afternoon. 

	I've asked Joe to look for a market & get me a notional price.  If we have gas it will be
	15,000 mmbtu for the month.  I have calls into Royster to see if they want this gas
	for April.  My guess is that they won't.

	mk

What's the game plan?  Let me know so I can work with Joe.  Or you may want to talk to him yourself.

whats wrong chet

Trying to determine what to slate for the weekend.  What do you think about fishing prospects?  Sat. morning?
 
If not fishing, I want to make a tee time somewhere.  Either way, I got to get on the calendar to get the ol' lady off my back about what I'm doing.
 
Thoughts, interjections, libations, deliberations?
 
Chad, the time in the "stall" with you last night was REAL.  Thanks.

Ed,wants me to get this deal closed. I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas. He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both. Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field. Lets Discuss.

Scott and Daivd, I sent this to Chance as well. Look at it and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks 
Joe

Ed, I spoke with Linda this morning. If we are intending to buy them gas for April, we need to know ASAP because nomination deadline for most of the Texas Inta-state   pipelines ( ie:Lonestar) is tomorrow by 2pm.

Made some minor changes

 

Chance, take a look at this file it will give you an ideal of what formate we are looking for on a consolidated report. We need the info non-PVed. Also, the oxy Info needs to be seperated.
Info we need is:

Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean. I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions. I am waiting for a response. 
 
I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout.
Joe
 

I really need you guys to push this with urgency. 

Joe, the EES book data is getting closer to what we need but not there yet. 

Please discuss w/ EES Risk (Scott Mills?): 
1) The Price (NG) positions are expressed in PV'd quantity.  We need this data in nominal form in order to place the appropriate number of contract hedges through our NYMEX broker.  

2) We need the NYMEX equivalent positions for basis so we can place NYMEX hedges as proxy for basis. 

Maria has a call into Pat Ryder to determine whether the ENA Price positions are PV'd or nominal.  We may need those adjusted as well.

Please set up a meeting w/ Risk to discuss the concept of NYMEX equivalent basis contracts.  Include ENA and EES risk folks as well as me, Maria Garza, and Yuan Tian.  (Yuan is out today.)  As you commented, we need to determine that we agree with the methodology and conversion factor prior to including basis in the hedge quantity.

Thanks 

Attached is the information that we discussed last evening. 

Please note the following -there are separate tabs for price, basis and index. 
        The tabs that indicate "OXY II Only" are exactly that -the deals associated with the potential second bid from OXY for additional activity.

        The tabs that DO NOT indicate OXY II consolidate both the base keeper list + the OXY II activity. 

If there is any doubt as to what you are looking at, check the first four lines or the worksheet.  There will be a designation of what is and is not included.

Shemin, you still stand by what you said below?

Joe,

Based on our discussions, the facts are as follows: Prior to 12/2/01,
ENA sold gas to One Oak.  During the period 12/4-12/31/01, Duke Field
Services inadvertently flowed gas on the MRT pipeline to ENA. ENA used
the gas received from Duke Field Services to fulfill its obligations
under the sales agreement to One Oak.  

ENA is obligated to pay Duke Field Services for the gas it received and
later delivered to One Oak because this event occurred post-petition and
benefited ENA.

Shemin

well, well

Go ahead and let's discuss before you pull the trigger.
Ed

I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 3/25/2002.

With the recent surge in U.S. natural gas prices many analysts are
scratching their heads in disbelief. Of course there will continue to be
volatility, but we believe these higher gas prices are not only
sustainable, but will likely move up through the summer (similar to what
happened in 2000). For the past two months it has become very evident that
U.S. natural gas supply/demand on a weather-adjusted basis is much tighter
than the same time last year. The market has finally begun to realize the
extent of this tightness, as more "normal" weather over the past several
weeks has removed a substantial amount of the natural gas storage overhang.
This shift in supply/demand should become even more evident as we move into
the early part of the injection season in April/May. Look for summer gas
injections to be down 30% to 50% from last year's numbers. This should be
the bullish driver of summer natural gas prices.

Next week, we should have even more bullish gas news, as the preliminary
numbers from our first quarter U.S. E&P production survey are likely to
surprise many on the Street. Stay tuned....

Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report. Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report. I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price.

David, we need the Oxy positions excluded and will also need the basis positions expressed as a Nymex equivalent number of contracts.

Attached please find an additional file which shows all the Nymex and basis positions for EES by region by forward month. These need to be evaluated carefully before being used as a basis for hedging due to the changing nature of our portfolios. Call me if you have any questions.

 << File: EES Nymex & Basis Mar 21.xls >> 

To all,
I have asked Louis DiCarlo and Joe Parks to contact you to arrange to meet today to review the positions in the wholesale and retail gas books.

Greg/Pat, please pull the current positions (like you have done before) but for each month from the live, ITM counterparties

Scott/Dave/Jess, please do same for the portion of the retail gas book that is designated for retention (not the OTM positions or positions that have or will be rejected and terminated).  If necessary, consider setting up a separate book for the OTM positions.  Also, if you are not currently doing so, please start marking all retail curves at the locations that we have positions.  

Please forward the position information to Louis, Joe and Elena Chilkina as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 Noon today.  If you have issues, please let me know.  Otherwise, I want to meet with all of you at 4:00 PM today in ECN 4105 to review the positions and discuss issues.

Thanks,
Ed  

  

Jess, David, Sean & Team

I have asked Ed McMichael to spend some time with you in the next 1-2 days to get better acquainted with the retail gas business.

Thanks for your cooperation

Dan

Thought you would want to look at this.

Thanks, 
Joe

 

Sent notice to Williams. They imediately responded that they had credit issues and were waiting to hear from us about the letter of credit.

Ponderosa Pines Energy Partners will be taking 25000mmbtu per day for the month of April.

let me know more details. i am interested

I am going fishing in May in Dickerson, want to go?

Yep, still here. Things are pretty slow, just waiting to get the hell out.

Thanks

that.

we recieved gas from Duke Field Sevices(flow dates: dec4-31 on mrt) and
deliverd it to Oneok per a sale agreement entered into pre 12/1/02

Joe the basis marks are unchanged, but nymex indication is about 3.721 for
the jun 02- dec 07.

Hey, can you see if these basis and index have moved since the last time we
checked and refresh the nymex for me.

its called liquidation

Wooo, what a day!  Blood-red screen, except for ORCL and good ol' PRGN
(climbed 8.7% to a buck even!).  Dollar trading right in hand w/ the
equities.

i figure by next week it should be good and sold off, i might get flat into
the fourth of july, because if there isnt a terriost attack, the monkeys
will come back and buy it

Just get us there by the end of the week and I won't have to worry about my
theta.

i am thinking 87-90 on DIA, however you manage your own theta. if i see
something that really scares me i will let you know

Now, what I'll REALLY need you for is telling me when to bail!!!

please get with me tomorrow to discuss.

ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). 

I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.

 I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time. 

Let me know when you have a minute.

talking today

Just finish Centana and then we can work on the next thing.  By the way, any word from your buddy at Duke?

Sure would like to be able to sell that inventory.

Nothing has changed.  We are still trying to figure our some way to sell this short/long term.  In fact, I have requested permission to show these documents to potentially interested third parties and haven't heard back from ChevTex.

What's the status of the Bridgeline Transportation and Storage?

thanks, the lonstar rep is keeping me current on the imbalance. since the 01/02, the imbalance is close 600k

Kim,

FYI, TXU is reflecting an imbalance of 462,270 Mmbtu on k 1671 as of 1/02 production.

- Lee Ann

The latest imbalance report from TXU reflects an imbalance of 228,852 on k 1671 as of 12/01 production.  TXU is sending a new report as of 1/01 production.  I will forward that imbalance value when I receive the fax.

i was looking at march - but i guess january would be the lastest we have.  so yes;

as of what time period - Jan. 2002?

can you check out what our imbalance is on TXU gas distribution is on K#1671?  unify is only showing a beginning balance of
72134 mmbtu's, but the trader (joe parks) thinks we have around 500000.

We currently do not have the curve information you need. Further, the curves I looked at in your spread sheet do not look good.

Paul -

Could you please get 3 broker quotes for the volumes & locations in the spreadsheet below ?

We need the quotes for the purposes of validating our internal curves and making E&Y more comfortable with our OXY valuation.

Thank You.

I don't like my odds on finding another.
 Let me know when you finish reviewing their comments. I will contact them about the sale, if we are ok with it.

Our bank is a done deal and just waiting for us. 
Good luck finding a buyer, Joe. That would be great.

Lets use whatever bank is easier. Wish me luck on finding someone else
to buy this gas. Lets hope we don't have to go that route.

Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 

Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
$1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
check with you Joe.

Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
move forward.

What's story?  This opportunity to sell short/buy puts?

Spoke with my contact at TXU. She said we should speak with Jerry Burt ( head of credit 214-875-9350 ) about getting payment directed to the appropriate accounts. However, he will be out of the office until Wednesday.

Yes, in harris county, looking to put a coffee stand in the new county court building/law center. They have no concessions. By the way, how are you and the family?

You're talking about Harris County not Cook County I assume. What kind of concession stand? 

Thanks. TMM.

   Wednesday 6/5/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Tuesday 6/4/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $25.33, up $0.25
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $24.70, up $0.21
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$3.33, up $0.09
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $3.65, up $0.06
   1% Residual Oil (on a MMBtu basis) - $3.91, up $0.04
   London Crude Oil - $24.24, down $0.21 (so far this morning)

   1) Energy Stocks Could See Weakness Over Next Month; Present Buying
   Opportunity.
      From a technical analysis standpoint, the oilservice group looks like
      it will trade sideways to down over the next month.  On the
      fundamental analysis side, there are no visible positive catalysts
      expected until July, when we should see: 1) a rollover in API
      inventories, 2) lower natural gas injections with warmer weather, and
      3) further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter
      natural gas production data.
      While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum
      inventories into July, it has experienced larger-than-expected builds
      over the past few weeks.  The energy market is likely to view this as
      a very bearish sign.
      We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds
      is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible 45 days ago before
      it cut off April/May exports in protest to the U.S. and Israel.
      Bottom line: The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to
      see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next
      4 weeks.  Based upon strong longer-term (6 to 9 month) fundamentals,
      however, we believe investors should take advantage of any potential
      weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of
      meaningful year-end upside.

   2) The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased 8.3
   MMBbls, to 669.0 MMBbls for the week ended May 31, 2002.
      The average consensus range called for a 0.5 MMBbl draw to a 0.8
      MMBbl build in total inventories.  This build in total inventories is
      very bearish for the oil market.
      Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude
      supplies, as well as greater distillate supplies.
      Total petroleum inventories are currently 27.2 MMBbls (~4%) above
      levels one year ago, and continues to climb above the five-year
      average.
      Motor gasoline inventories decreased by 0.8 MMBbls to 217.7 MMBbls
      last week, and are now 8.3 MMBbls above last year at this time.
      Distillate fuel inventories rose by 2.8 MMBbls to 127.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Distillate inventories are now 20.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.
      U.S. refinery operations were at a 93.4% utilization rate, which was
      1.1% higher than last week's 92.3% rate, and much higher than
      expectations of an ~0.25% increase.  Total petroleum imports
      decreased slightly to 11.8 MMBbls/day.

   3) Nabors' Re-incorporation Receives Independent Shareholder Group
   Endorsement
      Nabors Industries (AMEX:NBR/$40.00/Strong Buy) announced that
      Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Nabors
      shareholder vote in favor of the re-incorporation in Bermuda.  ISS is
      the leading independent provider of proxy analysis and voting
      advisory services.
      Yesterday, Nabors' Chairman and CEO Gene Isenberg repeated his belief
      that the proposed re-incorporation will result in significant tax
      savings and other long-term benefits for the Company that will
      outweigh the one-time capital gains taxes that investors will have to
      pay if the move is approved.
      A lawsuit that has been filed to try to block the vote appears to be
      innocuous, as it is not even on the court docket for a scheduling
      hearing until September and no motions for injunction have been filed
      yet.
      A special stockholders meeting to vote on the re-incorporation has
      been scheduled for June 14(superscript: th).  We currently expect
      that the proposal will pass the shareholder vote.

   4) Spring Fire Stops Short of Evergreen Resources'
   (NYSE:EVG/$43.90/Strong Buy) Coal Bed Methane Operations in Southern
   Colorado.

   ?       Evergreen reported that the Spring fire in southern Colorado's
   Las Animas County did not reach the company's coal bed methane
   operations in the Raton Basin.

   ?      The fire crossed into Evergreen's acreage but stopped one and a
   half miles short of the company's nearest well location.

   ?      As a precaution, Evergreen shut-in 69 gas wells in the Lorencito
   Canyon area.  These wells were producing at a combined rate of 6.2
   million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day prior to being shut-in at
   approximately 5:00 p.m. (MDT), Sunday, June 2.

   ?      This daily production rate represents approximately 5% of
   Evergreen's current total gross sales of 124 MMcf of gas per day.

   ?      Production from the Lorencito Canyon area was brought back on
   line yesterday at about 1:00 p.m. (MDT) and is expected to reach its
   prior average rate within the next several days.

   ?      According to latest reports, the Spring fire is mostly contained.
   Evergreen has made its produced water available to assist fire-fighting
   efforts in the area, and  does not expect future curtailments of its
   production unless weather and fire conditions change significantly.

   5) ONEOK (NYSE:OKE/$20.78/NR) Sells Equity Interest in Magnum Hunter
   Resources (Amex:MHR/$7.31/Buy).
   ?       ONEOK announced it has sold its remaining equity interest in
   MHR, representing 4.9 million shares (~7%) of Magnum Hunter's 70 million
   shares outstanding.

   ?      The $35.8 million proceeds from this sale will be used to reduce
   ONEOK's outstanding commercial paper.
   ?      ONEOK, Inc. is a diversified energy company involved primarily in
   oil and gas production, natural gas processing, gathering, storage and
   transmission in the mid-continent areas of the United States.

   6) Vintage Petroleum (NYSE:VPI/$11.65/Buy) Reiterates Commitment to
   Business Plan and Reduction Of Indebtedness; Rejects Restructuring
   Proposal.

   ?       VPI believes that its current depressed stock price is
   attributable primarily to its position in Argentina, which has
   experienced a series of economic and political shocks, and Vintage's
   relatively high leverage, which the company is committed to reducing.

   ?      Vintage recently announced several initiatives to reduce
   leverage, including the intention to reduce the Company's aggregate
   indebtedness by $200 million by year-end 2002 through a combination of
   the sale of non-core assets and cash flow in excess of planned capital
   expenditures

   ?      In response to the BP Capital Energy Restructuring Plan submitted
   on May 15, Vintage said that it has reviewed the plan, and concluded
   that it is not appropriate for the Company to pursue.  BP Capital
   currently owns ~8.9% of the outstanding Vintage common stock.

   ?      The restructuring proposal calls for the liquidation of Vintage's
   North American assets, creating a pure-play Latin American exploration
   and production company.

   7) Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC/$49.88/Market Perform)
   Apparent Winner On 34 Tracts in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Lease.

   ?       Anadarko announced that it was the apparent high bidder on a
   total of 34 tracts in Monday's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Oil and
   Gas Lease Sale 2002.

   ?      Anadarko and its partner, Phillips Alaska Inc., submitted winning
   bids representing a combined total investment of $9.6 million ($2.7
   million net to Anadarko).

   ?      The 34 tracts cover more than 282,000 gross acres and are located
   primarily west of the companies' Moose's Tooth discovery.

   ?      With this sale -- the second since the federal government resumed
   leasing in the reserve in 1999 -- Anadarko's leasehold in NPR-A will
   total 277,500 net acres.

Joe,
I spoke with Centana's attorney. According to him, they are not opposed
to the escrow account, just the hassle of paper work, but he is checking
with his commercial person and will get back to me today. I told him ENA
wants to do the deal, ENA is willing to open the escrow account, but
that's the deal. So I expect to hear from him shortly.

Attached is the email from Centana's attorney. At the very beginning of
Mike Richards' email he lists all of his claims.

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.  

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be

The trailer is in pretty good condition per the officer and he thinks the
tires were okay.  It is 6' x 10'.  Linda is still going to take a picture of
it today at noon and I will bring it home tonight.  

yes

Oh, just a little teaser for the group.  Believe me, they all just think
it's me being my usual weird, nonsensical self.

Do you want the picture you sent me?

thats enough, dont let the cat out of the bag. hey forward me that picture

Just so all of you know, the "review" of last night is not over yet.  Just
wait...

Had fun. Glad to see everyone at the Hybrid man night. Reported to Zander,
who was glad to hear we enjoyed the food. Joe that was not a TV dinner.
We still need to take care of the deer lease food/beer issues. ....whenever.
FYI John (Wollam) is fine. Has a pulled muscle in his neck.
Enjoyed eating eyes, eye socket fatty tissue, head meat, talking about how
much I care for my dog, eating heart meat, men playing with their meat, 
bowel distress and "grapes" and seeing how it played out for the one MAN 
audience.
I doubt Dave Wieland will join us again and Ted will likely be asked to turn

down the next invitation to join us by his friend.
I give the food an A+, service was also excellent. Chad gets the award for
being most "in" to the effort.
I will mark my calendar for 60 days to rip a thread for the next effort. e.

Do you have an email address for him? 

is it? 2.389 was the april contract settle yesterday.

Joe could you please verufy that the purchase price for the Bridgeline Pad gas is $2.389 - $0.015 = $2.374

 <<Redline_.rtf>> 
Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
taking "let me see it and I'll let you know" approach so let me know if
you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.

Hey, Stuart is recommending we proceed without hearing from Duke. Could you send me a copy of what you have. Any questions, give me a call 3-9636

Joe

Hi Joe, 
I am waiting to hear back from Centana's attorney. As soon as I hear
from him (re escrow account duties and required contract provisions) and
make any necessary revisions, I will forward the document to you.
Shemin

Joe,,,,,
Per our conversation today, please find attached for your review concerning
the above subject matter.
This is a Word Docuement , where redline changes can be made.

Should you have any questions, please call me at 214-875-9227.

does  anyone know what the hell they are doing?

Read below....I've pushed as much paper as I am going to on this transaction.  It can die as far as I am concerned.  Joe - this is your baby.  Should you so desire, you can cut and paste the old into the new.

Chris, the Batch Funding Request template will no longer be used.  Please put this request in the form of a DASH (template attached).  Thanks.

Chip - please put the following transaction in front of the Cash Committee for approval.  As you will recall from your discussions with Stuart Z, this is a self funding transaction where ENA will (1) sell gas in the ground (storage); (2) pay post-petition storage demand costs; and, (3) put in (third party) escrow the pre-petition amounts until such time as a mutually agreeable arrangement can be reached and the appropriate estate approval for settling pre-petition obligations are received.
 
As more fully described in the attached Batch Funding Request, the net proceeds to the estate will be approx. $1.7 million with funding anticipated in the first week of March.  
 
Call with questions.
 
Thanks

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Stuart

very well

Joe - talked w/ Zisman about Centana this p.m.  He agrees that so long as the party ENA shorted is different from the counter party on the implied storage agreement, then they are on shaky ground....and run the risk of blowing up the entire deal.  My sense is that should they desire to hold in escrow additional amounts (without the estate agreement)  they are exercising set off rights w/ affiliated ownership under an implied storage lease agreement.  That is some seriously bad ju ju (translated...they better think again).

I am going to push for cash committee approval tomorrow or Thursday as discussed yesterday.  Shemin should have her revised doc this p.m. or tomorrow a.m.

Men:

The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.

In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
hunting season.

I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.

TAKE A LOOK AT THESE FOR ME. THANKS.

Doug, 

Are the cash committee's activities in some way monitored by the court?  If so, then we can likely proceed with the payment.  If not, how do we proceed in the manner proposed below?  I will work with accounting to determine if there are any offsetting liabilities.

My view is that we cannot return this without court approval.  I assume
that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.

Melanie,  same request as prior email....Many thanks, Barbara

   Thursday 2/21/02
   Raymond James Energy Daily Update

   FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY

   Energy Price Summary (Close Wednesday 2/20/02):
   Oil (WTI) - $20.29, down $0.59
   12-Month Oil Futures Strip - $20.63, down $0.52
   Natural Gas (HHUB) -$2.39, down $0.01
   12-Month Natural Gas Futures Strip - $2.75, unchanged
   1% Residual Oil (on a Mcf basis) - $2.55, up $0.03
   London Crude Oil - $20.20, up $0.34 (so far this morning)

   1) AGA reports in-line injection, gas prices surge show strength on cold
   weather forecast/short covering
      Last week, 112 Bcf was withdrawn from storage, compared to 81 Bcf
      last year and expectations for a 115-120 Bcf withdrawal.
      Total storage is now 1,944 Bcf, which is 960 above last year.
      This week's report showed 4-5 Bcf/d less gas available for storage
      relative to last year on a weather-adjusted basis.
      The near-month (March) futures contract showed some strength this
      week, after the National Weather Service (NWS) forecasted
      colder-than-normal weather in several key consuming regions during
      the next 2 weeks.  Additionally, short covering by traders probably
      added to the positive momentum.  The contract traded as high as
      $2.46/MMBtu this week, before slipping to $2.40/MMBtu after the AGA's
      report.
      To reach 1,500 Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional
      withdrawal season, approximately 74 Bcf/week would have to be pulled
      from storage on average over the last six weeks.  This compares to
      approximately 56 Bcf/week withdrawn during the same period last year
      under normal temperatures.  As a result, of the NWS's forecast is
      accurate, we could still hit the 1,500 Bcf mark.  However, if weather
      remains 15-20% warmer than normal, the probability of withdrawing
      that much gas decreases substantially.
      Longer-term, we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals
      will be a supply driven equation.  Based on fourth quarter production
      volumes reported so far, it appears that U.S. natural gas production
      will, in fact, show both sequential and year-to-year declines.
      Despite the potential for near-term weakness in prices, we remain
      bullish on the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for natural
      gas.

   2) The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported that total petroleum
   inventories decreased 5.5 MMBbls to 673.6 MMBbls for the week ended
   February 15, 2002.

   ?       The consensus range called for a 0.7 MMBbl build to a 2.4 MMBbl
   build.  This is a bullish report for the oil market.  Total petroleum
   inventories are currently 73.5 MMBbls (~12%) above levels one year ago.

   ?       Crude oil inventories decreased 4.5 MMBbls to 316.2 MMBbls last
   week.  Crude oil inventories are 37.5 MMBbls above last year at this
   time.  Based on our current U.S. crude oil demand estimate, there are
   approximately 17 days of crude oil inventory.
      Motor gasoline inventories increased 0.6 MMBbl to 218.2 MMBbls last
      week.  Motor gasoline inventories are 13.0 MMBbls above last year at
      this time.

   ?       Distillate fuel inventories decreased 1.6 MMBbls to 139.2 MMBbls
   last week.  Distillate inventories are 23.0 MMBbls above last year at
   this time.

   ?       U.S. refinery operations were at a 88.5% utilization rate, which
   was 0.7% higher than last week's 87.8% rate.  Total Petroleum imports
   decreased to 10.4 MMBbls/day.
      Despite last week's larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum
      inventories, the slowdown in U.S. economic growth that was
      exacerbated by the September 11 terrorist attacks has continued to
      weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well
      above our 5-year average.

   OILSERVICE

   3) BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition.
   ?       Yesterday, BJ Services (NYSE:BJS/$30.03/Strong Buy) announced
   that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA, Inc.
   (NASDAQ:OSCA/$27.65) for $28 per share (a 27% premium to the
   pre-announcement stock price).  This all-cash deal equates to a total
   purchase price of roughly $420 million and is expected to close by the
   end of the second calendar quarter.

   ?       OSCA provides a full array of completion-related products and
   services, including completion fluids, completion tools and completion
   services.  BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental
   products, services and markets across its existing asset and customer
   base to yield significant pull-through revenue opportunities down the
   road.  While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA, the
   combination makes a lot of strategic sense.

   ?       Following the announced acquisition, we are making slight
   modifications to our near-term estimates.  Specifically, we are shaving
   a nickel from our existing FY2002 estimate, bringing it down to $1.25
   per share.  This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition
   without significant near-term cost savings or pull through benefits.  As
   management indicated on its conference call, it expects the deal to be
   accretive to the FY2003 consensus of $1.85 per share by $0.06 to $0.07
   per share.  Since we are already in print at $2.00, we are leaving our
   FY2003 estimates unchanged in order to be conservative.  Given the
   expected slight accretion to FY2003 earnings, combined with potential
   longer-term upside and an improving market outlook, we are maintaining
   our Strong Buy rating and 12-month target price of $37 per share.

   4) Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely
   undervalued relative to its peers!
      Following yesterday's acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services, it is even
      more clear now that Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI/$23.62/Strong Buy)
      is cheap.
      Specifically, OSCA was purchased for between 30-35x 2003 EPS, or
      12-14x 2003 EBITDA.
      If we apply those multiples to TTI, we come up with a value of $45 to
      $55 per share, as opposed to the current price of $23.62 per share.
      The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA, only perhaps not as
      well known.
      Following OSCA's acquisition, there remains a chance that TTI could
      be taken out at some point in time (although we have no reason to
      believe it will be soon).
      Furthermore, TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of
      this transaction.
      Finally, the company reported fourth quarter EPS of $0.35 per share,
      a penny above consensus.  It will host a conference call today at
      10:30am ET.  The dial in number is 800-860-2442.

   5) Unit Corp. handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations
   ?       Unit Corp. (NYSE:UNT/$12.60/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter
   earnings of $0.27 per share, compared to $0.43 per share in the fourth
   quarter of 2000.  This result was $0.04 ahead of the consensus estimate
   of $0.23 per share.

   ?       Revenues for the quarter came in at $49.3 million, down
   approximately 25% from last year and down 28% from the third quarter.
   Likewise, overall operating margins were down over 530 basis points
   year-to-year to about 50%, while they were also down a like amount on a
   sequential basis.

   ?       The strong quarterly results were largely a result of
   stronger-than-expected dayrates, utilization and margins during the
   quarter.  In fact, average dayrates were down by only about $800 to just
   under $10,200 per day.  Meanwhile, average realized oil and natural gas
   prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with
   declines on a year-to-year basis of 41% for oil and 61% for gas.
   Production volumes also decreased from last year by 2% for oil and 15%
   for natural gas.

   ?       Despite the generally strong results, drilling activity has
   fallen dramatically over the past couple months.  This drop in overall
   rig activity has had a significant impact on Unit's utilization,
   dropping from a quarterly average of nearly 71% rigs in Q4 to the
   current run-rate of 60%, pulling dayrates down another 10-15% currently.

   ?       Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and
   production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates,
   utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our
   quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates.  Accordingly, we
   are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003
   estimate of $1.40 per share.  Despite the lack of near-term visibility,
   the improving long-term outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy
   rating with a 12-month target price of $18 per share (based on a blended
   average of three valuation techniques).

   6) Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss
      Conrad Industries (NASDAQ:CNRD/$4.10/Strong Buy) reported its fourth
      quarter of a loss of $0.02 per share, compared to a profit of $0.10
      per share in the fourth quarter of 2000.  This results missed the
      consensus estimate by $0.14 per share.
      Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11%
      from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter.  The
      gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis
      points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points
      sequentially.
      The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the
      fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.
      The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the
      economy and offshore oil and gas industry.
      The Company will host a conference call at 10:30am ET this morning.
      You may access the call by dialing 800-966-6502.  A replay will be
      available by dialing 800-677-6200 and using access code 2280.

   E&P

   7) AEC Beats 4Q Expectations, EnCana Merger On Track
      AEC (NYSE:AOG/Strong Buy) reported fourth quarter 2001 EPS of C$0.55
      per share, which was ahead of our estimate of C$0.40 per share.
      AEC achieved record sales averaging 356,000 Boe/d, up 20% from 2000.
      Each of the three growth platforms - Canada, the U.S. Rockies and
      Ecuador - set new records.
      In 2001, AEC's established conventional reserves rose by 15% to
      nearly 6 Tcf of gas and more than 600 million Bbls of oil and natural
      gas liquids. The Company replaced 276% of 2001 conventional sales,
      with 89% of the reserve additions coming through the drill bit. The
      largest reserve additions were in the U.S. Rockies and northeast
      British Columbia.
      The merger with PanCanadian remains on track with shareholder's
      meetings scheduled for early April and closing expected shortly
      thereafter.
      Alberta Energy's merger with PanCanadian Energy to form EnCana will
      create the largest and fastest growing super independent producer in
      the industry with a C$27 billion enterprise value and visible
      production growth in excess of 14% annually for at least the next
      five years. The combined company will have a dominant position in
      North America with interests in western Canada, the U.S. Rockies,
      offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as 23 million
      undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern
      Colorado to Alaska.  EnCana will also have large international growth
      engines in Ecuador and the North Sea.
      Our target price of C$80 (US$52) is based on a 6.1x multiple of 2002
      cash flow, a valuation comparable to that of its super independent
      peers.  We reiterate our Strong Buy rating.

   8) Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected 4Q Results, Reduces Capital Budget
   for '02.
      Pure Resources (NYSE:PRS/$19.90/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
      $0.00 per share, which was significantly higher than our estimate of
      a loss of ($0.17) and the consensus estimate of ($0.13).
      PRS's production during 4Q:01 totaled 390 Mmcfe/d, up 70% from the
      same period last year, including acquisitions made during 2001,  and
      up 85% for the full year.  However, the company lowered 2002 volume
      guidance from 12% growth to 9% growth based on a reduced capital
      spending program.  As a result, we have lowered our 2002 earnings
      estimate from $0.32 to $0.31 per share to reflect the reduced
      expectations.
      Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of $1.12
      and $6.30, respectively, based on 11% production growth from 2002 to
      2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
      of oil.
      The Company replaced 385% of its production from all sources at a
      cost of $1.82/Mcfe, and increased its total reserves by 34% to 1,469
      Bcfe.
      We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on shares of Pure.  Through
      experience, operational focus and the application of newer
      technology, Pure has the opportunity to create significant value in
      the "mature" Permian Basin.  Our target price of $24 is based on a
      5.3x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified by the
      Company's geographical focus and operating leverage in the Permian
      Basin.

   9) XTO 4Q Results In-Line With Expectations.
   ?       XTO Energy (NYSE:XTO/$17.10/Strong Buy) reported 4Q:01 EPS of
   $0.42, which was in-line with our estimate of $0.41 and consensus of
   $0.40.

   ?       XTO's production during 4Q:01 totaled 565 Mmcfe/d, up 20% from
   the same period last year and up 17% for the full year.

   ?       Additionally, we are initiating 2003 EPS and CFPS estimates of
   $2.19 and $5.27, respectively, based on 12% production growth from 2002
   to 2003 and average commodity prices of $3.75/Mcf of gas and $26.00/Bbl
   of oil.

   ?       During the conference call, XTO mentioned that it may make an
   acquisition in lieu of a portion of its organic production growth
   through the drillbit.  More specifically, XTO may forego a portion of
   its East Texas drilling budget and use $100-150 million towards an
   acquisition.  Either way, XTO is expected to achieve its 17-20%
   production growth target.

   ?       XTO has a multi-year inventory of development opportunities in
   the low-F&D cost Arkoma and San Juan Basins, as well as the East Texas
   Freestone and Bossier Trends.  For an E&P company, XTO has a
   large/diverse asset base, substantial project inventory, and multiple
   productive zones in its core producing areas.  We are maintaining our
   Strong Buy rating on shares of XTO based on the company's ability to
   generate consistent double-digit production growth.  Our target price of
   $24 is based on a 6.5x multiple of 2002 cash flow, a valuation justified
   by the company's consistent and visible growth.

I believe you have everything

All I have is what I gave to you.  Joe,  where there any other documents received from Centana?

Hi Gerald,
Yesterday you gave me the gas transportation contract between CIPCO and
ENA. Do you have a copy of the firm gas storage agreement between the
parties? My no is 5-3910. Thanks

Shemin

Kay,  Mark is aware of this transaction.  The following is his response
to Centana's counsel email.  I did discuss with Mark this morning, the
current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made
sense.

As it stands now we would sell all the gas in-place to Centana and they
would net out post-petition fees.  Our business people feel that we have
used the storage services post-petition and consequently those fees
would be an administrative expense.  An amount equivalent to the
pre-petition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court
resolved the pre-petition amounts.   All remaining amounts would be

Gentlemen,

Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the Texas book.  We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing.  Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps.

Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data.  Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.

(See attached file: StorageLeaseLettterAgree2-14-02.doc)

(See attached file: StorageLeaseRevisions-2.doc)

damn your good

Gerald/Chip,

Could you tell me how to proceed on this deal.  This differs a bit from the deal that was originally discussed but seems to make sense.  Please disregard the second attachment at it relates to a modification of the Storage Agreement that has not been discussed (and one that we are not willing to make).  Also, the letter as drafted does not contemplate (but we will insist on) placement of the proceeds from the sale of gas associated with pre-petition amounts into escrow with some third party until some resolution is reached on those amounts.

By way of example, if Centana is owed $100k pre-petition, $150k post-petition and has $1,000,000 worth of gas in the ground, Centana would remit (i) $100k to an escrow agent for subsequent resolution and disposition and (ii) $750k to ENA ($900k offset by the $150k for post petition obligations).

The key issue is what level of approval is needed to do this.  A strong case could be made for Cash Committee only because no pre-petition amounts are being paid (and no resolution of those amounts is being reached).  Rather, we are just converting the commodity to cash when the market is higher than it has been over the past several weeks.

Another good reason for doing this is that after the cavern is empty, we can argue that we are not using it and therefore no more post-petition obligations continue to accrue following the consummation of the deal (while we decide to accept or reject).

Please advise at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 5/28/2002.

Over the past several weeks, numerous analysts' reports have suggested
there has been a massive destruction of gas demand, as gas prices have
recently moved above $3.50/mcf. We believe the foundation for many of these
reports is both poor analytical methodology and bad data. To conclude that
weather-adjusted natural gas demand has fallen by 5 to 10 bcf per day
implies a demand deterioration level similar to what we saw in early 2001,
when prices soared to near $10 per mcf. Unlike then, today's fuel-switching
incentives still favor natural gas. Secondly, there is little economic
incentive for today's industrial consumers of natural gas to shut down
plants in an improving economic environment. The current economy is very
different than the deteriorating economic environment in early 2001.

I promised Chip something in writing by lunchtime tomorrow.  Please let me know if you can't be done by then.  If memory serves me there wasn't much more that needed to be done.

Talked to Chip.  We do need Cash Committe approval given the netting feature of your deal, which means Batch Funding Request.  Please update per my previous e-mail and forward.

Joe-

I spoke to legal.  Other than the non-solicitation agreements some former employees may have signed companies have not been informed that they may not hire Enron employees.  Particularly in the case where an employee seeks out employment with another company the other company is in no way liable for speaking to or employing that employee as long as the employee is not under an employment contract.

KB

stu said he would get with chip

I think you got your answer from Stuart, but the issue is the netting of post petition storage.....are you calling Chip?

chris

i was told by ed that we would not need a batch funding request to sell gas against post petition. 

Joe - we are going to move forward on the two step approach on the Centana deal that we discussed.  However, to execute step one (sell pad gas with the exception of the amount to cover pre-petition storage cost and net post petition storage costs against proceeds), we will still need to present a Batch Funding Request.  Therefore, please update the working copy to reflect the deal as we've discussed, including justification of the pricing (basis).  Have you discussed w/ the counter party the issue of continued storage costs?

Stuart - once Joe gets this done, we'll forward for your review, send/discuss with Chip to ascertain level of review (hopefully only Cash Committee per Gerald).  Goal is to close this week/ early next week.

Gerald - do you want to start drafting documents and do we want to include a termination provision such that ENA will no longer incur post petition cost on pre-petition retainage?

THIS IS AN INTEREST STATEMENT "foreigners want to add to their holdings of
US assets when they already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of
corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?"

In some of this morning's analysis w/r/t our discussion yesterday...

* The net EUR/$ equity flow is Euro supportive currently mainly due to US
buying in Euroland, the same is happening with US investors buying
Japan. Net government bond flows are also US$ bearish both with
Euroland and with Japan, the latter due to strong signs of Japanese
repatriation still.
*  All this backs up what seemed a peculiar weakening of the US$
yesterday. For the remainder of the year the big question for the Dollar is
will foreigners want to add to their holdings of US assets when they
already hold 11% of the US equity market, 21% of corporate bonds and
36% of the Treasury market?
* We know that the there is likely to be net FDI outflow from the US in
2003,
with our pipelines suggesting a net US$46.2bn pending outflow currently
the worst it has been for many years. It is noteworthy that FDI has funded
around a third of the US current account deficits over the last 3 years, as
important as, net equity inflow.

Jim, do you think we want to be in the middle here, it might be cleaner to send the money back to el paso

This should go for insturctions on the El Paso check too.  It could go directly to AEP as well.  Troy is preparing a payment request and Lisa Koerselma should be in charge of doing the wire transfer request.

Send AEP the money, Enron has no interest in this money and it is not property of the Estate  bng

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this.  Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.

I have received a similar question and would love to get an answer on this.  Is there a distinction between a loan and a payment received by mistake for purposes of repayment from a debtor company?

We have just learned that Exxon sent their Sept, Oct, Nov, and Dec 2001 King Ranch Processing checks to Enron rather than to AEP totalling $4.6mm.  AEP have called asking for their money.  Please advise.

Thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other

appreciate your efforts.

LOWER, however it doesnt break soon. it will consolidate. dont see any big rallies or major pull backs

What's it trying to do here?  I feel like we may trade up a little as people
start to grow "bored" w/ the acct'g issues, then will resume the downtrend
as people see bad news in the economy.  What do you think over the next week
or two?

no , let me get a few more questions answered. than we will put it back on. However if you think we should, go ahead.

Should I roll it over until next Friday?

Phil, lets take Centana off the forcast. I dont think anything is going to happen that fast. 

Attached is the updated 5 day cash flow forecast for wholesale gas.  Please note that this includes revisions from yesterday.

SPOKE WITH CENTANA, HE HAS TOLD ME THAT HE IS WILLING TO LET ME SELL SOME OF THE INVENTORY. HE HAS STATED THAT HE WILL WANT TO KEEP SOME OF THE INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL FOR PRE AND POST PETITION DEMAND  FEES.

Chris/Joe
 
Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.
 
By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.
 
Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Stuart

ISNT ANDERSON YOUR AUDITOR? IS THAT A CONFLICT?

YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF THE POWERS REPORT. UNBELIEVEABLE!

My buddy up here knew a guy he had listed as a reference from Andersen, so
we got the inside scoop.

Any prospects out there?

dont know who that is. i can find out if you want me too. I know a few
people in RAC. things arround here still suck. i am doing a little stock

Thought you might find this interesting.

HEY FOOL, YOU THOUGHT COLUMBIA WAS BAD, THIS SHIT SUCKS ELEPHANT BALLS.

T
he first detailed allegations that Enron
abused mark-to-market accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided
by a professor and former deriva-tives
trader who reviewed the Enron case
for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.
Those charges, along with allega-tions
that have surfaced that mark-to-market
accounting was misused by Enron
Energy Services, the company's retail
energy and services unit, are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemak-ers
for much more disclosure on mark-to-market
accounting practices and the
impact of mark-to-market accounting on
earnings trading firms' earnings.
In testimony Thursday before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty
of San Diego Law School, said it
appears that Enron traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements.
"In a nutshell, it appears that some
Enron employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate
false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives
Enron traded," said Partnoy, who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committee's request. "It appears that Enron
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves, typically in order to hide losses."
"Traders are compensated based on
their profits," he observed, "so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves, he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus."
Partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem.
"For each trade," he testified, "a
trader would report either a profit or loss,
typically in spreadsheet format. These
profit-and-loss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality. Frequently they
did not. Instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column, some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns. The first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent
financial statements. The second col-umn,
ironically labeled the 'prudency'
reserve, included the remainder."
Partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation, "Enron's 'prudency'
reserves did not depict economic reality,
nor could they have been intended to do
so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time. The portion of prof-its
recorded as 'prudency' could be used
to offset any future losses," he said.
He recommended that investigators
question Enron employees who were
involved in these transactions "to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete."

1 star hangover (*)

No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere disco
nap which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy.  Be glad that you
are able to function relatively well.   However,you are still parched. You
can drink 10 sodas and still feel this way.  You are craving a steak bomb
and a side of gravy fries.

2 star hangover (**)

No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have
mental capacity of a staple gun. The coffee you chug is only acerbating
your
rumbling gut, which is craving a rootie tootie fresh and fruity pancake
breakfast from IHOP. Last night has wreaked havoc on your bowels.

3 star hangover (***)

Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely not productive.
Anytime a girl walks by you gag because her perfume reminds you of the
random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer 86'd
your ass at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your
bed
with a dozen donuts and a meatball sub You've had 4 cups of coffee, a
gallon
of water, 3 Snapples and a liter of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.

4 star hangover (****)

Life sucks. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else
you might puke. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and
given
you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes,but that can't
hide the fact that you missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving, (girls,it
looks
like you put your make-up on while riding the bumper cars). Your eyes look
like one big vein and your hair style makes you look like a reject from the
class picture of Revere High, '76.

5 star hangover(*****)

a.k.a. "Dante's 4th Circle of Hell." You have a second heartbeat inyour
head
which is actually annoying the employee who sits in the nextcube.  Vodka
vapor is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have
toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth.
Your
body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating
you. Death seems pretty good right now. You definitely don't remember who
you were with, where you were, what you drank, and why there is a stranger
still sleeping in your bed at your house.

6 star hangover (******)

Otherwise known as the "Infinite Nutsmacker"You wake up on your bathroom
floor. For about 2 seconds you look at the ceiling, wondering if the cool
refreshing feeling on your cheek is the bathroom tile or your vomit from 5
hours ago. It is amazing how your roommate who was as drunk as you, but
somehow manages to get up before you the next morning...You try to lift
your
head. Not an option. It is when you turn your head too quickly only to
smell
the funk of 13 packs of cigarettes in your hair, and suddenly you realize
you were smoking, but not ultra lights... some jackass handed you Marlboro
reds, and you smoked them like it was your second full time job. You look
in
the mirror only to see remnants of the stamp "Ready to Rock" faintly atop
your forehead... that explains the stamp on the back of your hand that has
magically appeared on your forehead by alcoholic osmosis. You have to be to
work in t-minus 14 minutes and 32 seconds and the only thing you can think
of wearing is your "hello kitty" pajamas.....

Thanks.
Let me know if you can show me a FGT2 and Sonat Feb physical basis.

 <<JHP.doc>> 

Spoke with Joe Parks this p.m.  Bridgeline will require gas retention to cover December and January storage and transport fees (approx. $1.32 million).  Assuming a $2.35 fixed price for the gas, we should be able to liquidate a little better than 1 Bcf.  It will take (at most) 9 days to withdrawal given our firm withdrawal rights of 150,000 MMBtu/d.  The storage contract has interruptible withdrawal rights above this, but any withdrawals above 150,000 MMBtu will be on a best efforts basis.

Our highest net back will probably be Henry Hub; however, ENA's Transport Agreement only allows 55,000 firm delivery rights to HH...everything else will be on a secondary basis, which carries a lower priority of service in the event the pipeline restricts flows to HH.   Joe mentioned that Bridgeline may be willing to purchase the gas in ground.  Once we get the go ahead to sell, it will be a matter of  determining the best price to ENA.  The transport and storage does not appear to carry any incremental charges to move it across the Bridgeline system, since we will be reserving gas for January transport fees.  Therefore, we will look to the highest offer on the system.

Joe reminded me of a Bridgeline issue you addressed in an earlier e-mail which stated "he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald."  

Questions:
1. Do you know where Gerald sits in relation to this matter?
2. Do we have to go to the BMC / Cash Committee, etc...to transact?

Let me know.

Yes, they might be a logical choice. 

I am not certain that we will ultimately approach Gulf South on the pad gas but it seems to make sense that we talk to them about the storage/transport deal.

Stuart

Since it appears we are going to approach Gulf South about the purchase of pad gas, shouldn't we also gauge their interest in ENA's storage/transport position, including any available molecules?

Take a look at the mini-dash I've thrown together.  Let me know what comments or corrections you have.  I want to get this to Stuart for his approval this evening so we can have it teed up for tomorrow morning.  The attached is just the verbage, but I think it may make sense to attach your spreadsheet and possibly some support for our Bridgeline valuation as appendices.

Thanks,

Ed,

In my conversations with Andy Edling at NGPL, he indicated to me that NGPL is  unwilling to allow us to permanently release ENA storage contracts to a third party. He is  recommending that we work out a capacity release arrangement with a third party.

Raymond James Energy Stat of the Week, published 01/07/02.

Recent energy investment sentiment could be characterized as a fear-driven,
cautious psychology that has led to a generally under-owned condition for
most energy stocks.  A major contributor to this negative psychology has
been the underlying belief of investors that "energy stocks always bottom
several times before a sustained upward move."  While that was true in the
1998/1999 downturn, we are convinced that today's energy fundamentals are
far different than those experienced in the downturn several years ago.  In
fact, we believe today's environment is much more similar to that
experienced in the 1972/1974 timeframe, when energy stocks experienced a
two-year run-up followed by a recession and subsequent nine month sell off.
In the 1974 downturn, however, the stocks experienced one bottom in the
late fall and never looked back.  Likewise, we are convinced that energy
stocks have already seen their lowest levels and as strong commodity
fundamentals become visible later in the first quarter, the stocks will
begin to run.  In other words, we believe the energy stocks are near the
bottom of a cyclical downturn within what we believe is going to be a
longer-term secular upswing.  That means that now is the time to be buying
energy stocks!

Joe
39636

thanks for reply( i already heard from you), but its the other assholes i would like to hear from

I'll be at a wedding, but will raise one to Weller on my own.

Is anyone coming over Sunday or will the family and I be eating alone?

made with meat from around the mouth?

Correct...what is a mouth burger?

you know its a mouth burger, boca is spanish for mouth

Could someone explain to me what a boca burger is?

I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.

I will see you then.

By the way, I am assuming that the "cabana" is at your house.  Is this

Hard to write this, so i will keep it short. Weller passed away Sunday morning. The 12.5yrs were wonderful.
Thought you would want to know.

so sorry to hear about your dog, Weller.   thanks for telling andrew!
 
Hope you guys are well.  If you feel like a  road trip, Caroline's 1st b-day party is July 14th (on a Sat.)  Would love  to see ya'll!
 
Laura

I only have Elsa's as of right now, but as soon as I receive Danny's List I'll send it your way as well.
Laura

 

glad you were succesful, i am not, getting run over, when it rains it pours

Our hearing went well.  I was able to keep taxes where they were last year.
Hope you are having a good morning.

talk to Kim

Is there a group even planned?  Erik's gone, and not sure if there was a
dinner planned or not.  Do you know?

ok, wea re in  for big ass

We are meeting tomorrow night (Wed. June 6th) at Carrabbas on I-10.  Let me
know if you and yours will be attending.  I'm thinking big-ass juicy pork
chunk.

just make her get a job

Just have him reduce the feeding by $1k/yr and I'll get on for $1k.  I'll
make up for it by throwing some steaks out in the feed pen.

Well, you never know...
Got back into the office today after taking two days off with Sheila and
family in Fredricksburg to find a thick envelope from Mertz Ranch Company
buried in my "in box". Did not know what to expect, had visions of Mertz
mailing it back with a note saying forget it.
Instead, the lease was signed and dated and had a nice note saying "thanks".

Go figure.

We've got a lease for four more years. Same deal, same contract as the last
three years, just 6K more a year. Price remains the same this year. next
year it is 2k a year per spot and we will need to add one spot. Still
waiting on Chet. Would like to know who McCombs would suggest if Chet does
not commit. Lease requires Mertz to spent 2k a year on protien feed. He and
I can agree in writing to reduce or increase that amount with a
corresponding reduction or increase in lease cost. Term is April 1, 2002 to
April 1 2005; exclusive right to hunt turkey and deer, spring turkey
starting the third weekend in april.

I'm pleased. Hope you are, too.

Erik.

Daily Market Commentary October 25, 2001

TRADERS SKEWER ENRON . . .

 Natural gas futures retreated in busy trading Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Much of the volatility was the result of trade and commercial accounts seeking to profit from a perception of market weakness by a prominent trade and commercial account. Other trade and commercial players bid the cash market higher with the intent of forcing liquidation of underwater short positions. Today's activity is not seen as significant in the determination of longer term price trends, and short term traders see the market working higher. . .
 
 At the end of the day, the November futures fell $.043 to $2.938 per MMBtu. The December contract eased $.068 to $3.103 per MMBtu. . .

 "This was called the 'get Enron day'. Many customers said that Enron was short the market and at first traders ran the cash market higher. For a while the cash market was ahead of the futures by as much as 10 cents, and as soon as the gap was (partially) filled on the December charts at $3.25 to $3.30 (August 24), the bottom dropped out and when prices fell below unchanged, it got ugly," said a New York floor trader. . .

 "Basically Enron was taken to the cleaners. Traders knew that Enron had to get out of positions. There was talk of funds needed to pay an SEC fine, and
traders took advantage of that." . .

 "There was no sympathy for Enron anywhere. Traders knew they had them on the run." . . 

 "I believe if prices can hold the $2.80 to $2.82 in the November, the best
plan is to come back and buy again," he said. . .

 "The activity today was just a 'get Enron' tactic. Other traders were hearing the same thing from their customers."

understand that mertz saw decent deer that only you are suppose to know about.

THAT SUCKS...Why the hell arent they working? Doesn't make any sense.
They were all new batteries, right?

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

LETS GO HUNTING

Let me know as soon as you can on "Seterdey" -- Molly's been getting pissed
at me since I won't tell her if I'm really going or not.

HEy, i will talk to Kim about saturday. Saturday it should be clear out
there. the question will be friday. the long QQQ  is a short term couple
of bucks type trade. think its got 35-36

Technology is not quite where it needs to be yet. I s/b able to simply
think
about moving $$ and making an investment, as I don't seem to have time
these
days to get online and do it!  I just watch the virtual gains slip
away...

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't
seem to figure out what the weather is going to do.  The San Antonio
forecast looks different than KC's, so I can't tell what the chances of
rain
are on Friday and Saturday.  Want to make sure it's worth while.  What
do
the "models" say?

Of course, if you don't go, I'll probably blow it off anyway (no
pressure).

Yes, i can make a little money on the long side of a market

it was me. it now makes since why erik was acting like an asshole. Brian, why do you take that shit.

Has anyone figured out who Erik talked to Friday afternoon...apparently
he had a conversation with a person who he thought was me...you know,
typical "man" talk. I called him and asked him where he was (lots of
noise in the background, beer bottles clinking, women hootin' and
hollerin', etc.). His reply was, "Whaddayamean...I'm at the same place
as the last time you asked me that." (Bar) I said , Erik, I havent
talked to you all day> He said, "Really...well I had a conversation for
about 10 minutes with someone I thought was you about an hour ago".
Nope, wasnt me!!! "I guess it was Chad, then. With all this noise (Bar),
It is difficult to hear (that combined with apparent beer drinking,
added to his confusion) I called Chad moments later to find out what the
conversation between Erik and "I" was....he verified, as well, that he
had not talked to him, either!!!
	Now, this is funny. Can you imagine what the conversation was
like for the poor bastard on the other end of the line who E thought was
me? 
Example...Pig references, references to drinking, large breasted bar
"ho's", shooting and eating things, snide, disparaging remarks intended
to disempower, and large amounts of colorful metaphors. 
	I certainly hope that Erik was talking to one of us, and not
some prospective client or business associate. This could be a SNL skit,
if done correctly!!!
Pretty damn funny....

I'm planning on going this weekend. Who else?  Hudge?  

The birds I've seen behind this cold front are not lacking in speed or
agility.  Thinking its time for the 12 ga. (can't shoot my 20 worth a
#@!
anyway).

Where's Major? 

Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to
KC. 
Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but
enough. 
Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding
in 
the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot
7 
birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to
hide 
with two wiggling boys.
Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according
to 
his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road
from 
the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed
yet, 
still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding
across 
road from 100 acres.
John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big
pig 
tracks.
If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I
left a

pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will
hold 
onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.

When did Joe graduate from Mr. to "senior"?
 
What's the deal. No traffic all week. Makes coming to work really lame.

Here's something to talk about. Karnes City!!! Like it is time to cut checks
again and mail them to the opielas before they call me and hit me up for a
raise on our rent.

John:Last year looks like the break down was as follows: you wrote a ckedk
to Rancho Grande Trust for 2,600 and collected from Mark and Matt.
I wrote one for 900 and collected from pig, shet, smack, hudge and senior
saftey.

SO Brian, Chet, Chad, Hudge and Joe need to cut me a check for 150 a piece
and mail it to my office 815 walker #1447 H/T 77002.

If you are not interested in getting back on, let me know so I can fill your

Reuters Company News
ChevronTexaco faces tough choices on Dynegy stake 

By Carolyn Koo 

NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - ChevronTexaco Corp. (NYSE: CVX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvx&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/c/cvx.html>) faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DNY <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dny&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dny.html>), such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away, or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader. 

	

The deep pockets of the second-largest U.S. oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy, the Houston-based power trading company reeling from regulatory probes, fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in free-fall. 

But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses, or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. (Other OTC: ENRNQ.PK <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=enrnq.pk&d=t> - News <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/enrnq.pk.html>) 

"ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place," said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst at Fahnestock & Co. "After all this, are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy?" 

San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco said it has a "vested interest" in Dynegy's success, but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take. The company owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy, a stake that has lost nearly three-quarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November. 

Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as $300 million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week, even as U.S. and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company. 

Already, Dynegy's credit rating is in danger of falling to "junk" levels. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Dynegy's credit rating in on review, while rival credit agency Standard & Poor's has placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch. 

"If Dynegy is downgraded to junk, they'll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco," said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse. 

Dynegy shares fell 57 cents, or 5.8 percent, to an almost three-year low of $9.31. ChevronTexaco's stock has not been rocked by the power trading sector's woes. Its shares rose $2.15, or 2.4 percent, to $90.10. 

BOARD'S ROLE 

Dynegy is also the subject of several probes, including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal, "Project Alpha," that cut the company's tax bill by $80 million. Another probe is looking into "wash trades" intended solely to boost trading volumes. 

ChevronTexaco's silence since Dynegy's troubles have come to light has worried analysts. 

When credit rating agency Standard & Poor's placed Dynegy's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch last week, it said it was "concerned about the lack of any public statement of support" from ChevronTexaco "in this period of market tumult" for Dynegy. 

"If the situation deteriorates, I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy," said James Elliot, a portfolio manager with Dominick & Dominick Advisors. 

Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation. Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegy's board, including Chief Financial Officer John Watson. 

"It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing," said Gheit. "I hope not, because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco." 

He added that bailing out Dynegy "would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy. The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco ." 

Chevron acquired the stake in 1996, before its merger with Texaco, when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp. bought Chevron's natural gas business. 

ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to 36 percent by redeeming $1.5 billion in convertible preferred shares in the company. It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegy's planned purchase of Enron.

that is a really bad wind for many blinds. mertz called this am. has not 
seen a big buck he say in the bull pasture since last week. COuple of young 
deer, one good looking young 8. Lots of deer eating protien at booger. Has 
not seen them, but feed disappearing quick. wants us to shoot some deer out 
of that front pasture. Good rub (big) seen by tank at booger. says you can't 
miss it. has seen some decent pre-rut activity this week.
There is another good buck in the robertson pasture. He saw it crossing the 
oil field road last week. big body, 5 points on the side he saw, good mass.

Brian should be trying to organize a menu. He will procure keg of bud light 
if mccombs get the "kegerator". McCombs, stay posted.

HEY BRIAN, FOR WHAT ITS WORTH. I THINK A KEG IS A BAD IDEA. I DONT THINK WE WILL DRINK THAT MUCH BEER ON OPENING WEEKEND. EXSPECIALLY IF CHAD IS NOT THERE.

THAT SUCKS...Why the hell arent they working? Doesn't make any sense.
They were all new batteries, right?

Talked to Chris and Mertz this am.

Mertz saw some decent deer today. Still hot out there

McComb had a shitty 24 hours. Scrambler out of gas wanted to blam on us.
I 
pointed out we used it for about hlaf an hour, only. then he got one
flat 
tire in his suburban.
three feeders are down, one was booger which should have been repaired. 
Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard 
not working. Hideout not working. Those may be battery issues. the other
7 
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his 
bother shot a bunch a few weeks ago while picking stuff off their lease.

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good 
deer walking out.

he got another flat tire 13 miles away from llano at 9:30 pm. sherriff
was 
the only one he could get to help. a tow truck towed his truck back to 
austin. he had his daughter with him. he got home at 1 am. he says his
wife 
may not let him go back.

doubtful keith will get out there next weekend to fix those feeders.
we'll 
have to fix them up on openning weekend.

e.

I finally found the damn trigger?or at least figured out what it was for!!!
 
Yeah, but who shot it?  Surely it wasn't BRIAN!

ok, whose the worst photograper you know
Actually Joe?the last 2 pictures that you took (incidentally, the only 2 pictures you took) were BLANK!!! Don't ask me why, but they were not exposed at all!!! So, I took one of Erik's shots, scanned it and blocked it. Worked out pretty well, I think. 
 
whose the best photographer
Yeah, but who shot it?  Surely it wasn't BRIAN!

does your camera work?
RRRIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTT
 
ok, whose the worst photograper you know

BEER! 
 
Would it focus if the lense cap were on? When i was focusing they looked like they should have turned out nice. Weird. I quess thats why we need to take pics with two cameras.
Well sure Joe?all the pictures before AND after your efforts were just perfect?.still trying to figure it out. Hand over the lens is the only thing I could come up with, because the settings never change (being that it is an auto focus unit) unless you force them. Weird?

will a pound of beans be enough or should i make 1.5lbs?, i will also make them this weekend and freeze. any objections

you the man

The Lord works in wonderful ways.
My dear opposing counsel failed to appear at docket call this morning for 
our December 3rd, 2001 trial setting on the case you have heard me talk 
about so much.
The court dismissed their case for want of prosecution on the spot for no 
showing. While they have 30 days to try to get the case reinstated, the 
bottom line is that I will not have trial looming over my head while we hunt 
and you will not have to listen to me drone on about this ridiculous case 
(unless you want me to and at least for now).
Sincerely, Lawyer Boy.

dec 14 no moon. 18th its 11% gets to 50% on the 24

Deer All:

Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer up. 
Very generous.

Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in the 
morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled the 
deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as the 
deer bolted away.

I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the 
Hole sunday morning.

Pictures forthcoming.

Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
everywhere he went.

Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next 
morning. 21" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed 
that it was 4.5 and should go another year.

Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to 
fence at highway.

Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and 4:30. 
But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered putting 
a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to you. 
We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good schlocho 
and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in Lonestar 
and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased. 30-30 
was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have 
lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the spin 
time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite and 
showtime..
Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston boys 
openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed but 
cap it at $500, spread across the board.

Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and closing 
weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great if 
Keitha nd boys would be there too.

Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.

e.

if it helps your situation, i can stay monday possibly tuesday

I've checked calendar. Good news for weekend of 15th. Sheila's firm party is 
the same weekend as Zander deal. Since I'm the boss (one of them) at my 
office, I'll make sure my firm party is not the weekend of the 15th. I think 
you can count on me going. Henry will go. Chet is invited.

Ok with Freds. and Playa. Dont know anything about Galveston, need more info( days?).

We need to decide about the Playa del carmen trip.  THe cheapest airfare we
have found is $426.  THe trip would probably end up costing us a little over
$1000 (per couple) not including food.  Our thought are to leave on June 13
and return on June 16 so we would be there over our anniversary.  I am
thinking of taking that whole week off if we decide to go to Fredericksburg
and then Galveston (Gene's got that hotel room at Moody Gardens) the early
part of the week.  WHat are you thoughts?

What about the others in my group?

I have called a few people and found that the estate team will be supporting you.  I forwarded your phone number and let them know to get this done ASAP.  You should get a call soon.

Good luck,
Daniel

Congrates Jack!

Dear friends and colleagues,
 
I wanted to inform you that I am leaving Hart Publications shortly to take a position as the Majority Staff Director of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. The Subcommittee is part of the House Committee on Resources and has jurisdiction over oil and gas development, coal and hard rock mining and geothermal energy development on federal lands including the offshore Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountains and Alaska. My last day at Hart is May 10 and I start at the Subcommittee on May 13.

I am looking forward to this new opportunity though I have had a great experience at Hart Publications and Hart Downstream Energy Services and I am really going to miss the people I work with here. Hart is really like a family - in the Washington office and in Houston. I can't speak highly enough about the organization and the professional people I have worked with for over eight years.  <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

If you want to reach me at the Subcommittee, the number is (202) 225-9297. I believe that my email will be jack.belcher@mail.house.gov <mailto:jack.belcher@mail.house.gov>

I look foward to staying in touch.

Sincerely,

Jack

Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you sort recognitions during the 
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that day.  If you are able to sort 
our troop's recognitions (troop 12357) by Tuesday evening, I would love to 
come by and pick them up.  Our last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday 
afternoon, and I wanted to get everything to our troop leader Wednesday 
morning before work.  Let me know what time would be convenient for me to 
come by.  I have a Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm but 
could come by before.....

Thanks,

We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.  I 
think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC  
postings for the three pipes plus a penny.  Those prices are as follows:

Transco Zone 3  $4.51
Florida Zone 3    $4.45
Sonat                      $4.47
Avg                        $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 

The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted 
from this price.  I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
 
Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.  
ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices!).

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan,

Do you have any idea when we will receive volumes and pricing for the Bazor
Ridge Gas Plant for November?  If I need to contact someone else concerning
these issues please let me know.

Thanks,

being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

P.S.-  Was new paperwork sent out to Cinergy??

Stevens-

I haven't heard back from our accounting group on what their fax number is.  
In the meantime, you can just fax the invoice to me at 713-646-8453.

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 11/28/2000 01:39:51 PM
Susan,

Could you please provide a fax number for our invoice?

Thanks,

Stevens

Good questions!  The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would 
need to be deducted.  Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.  As for the 
prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu 
transportation.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 11/21/2000 10:38:40 AM
Susan,

Please bare with me on these questions.  1)  Do the volumes have the 1%
fuel taken out?
                           2)  Do the prices have the transportation taken
out?

I assume somethings, but a thought best to ask.

Thank you,

Stevens

Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of

We have not received any final allocation from Destin.  I'm not sure what the

him today.

Susan,

I have Kali on our list for Sat the 25th. If you can, send a check for $27
and that will move you to the head of the list. Prepaid riders go to an
instructor ahead of "stand-by" riders. If you are unsure about whether or not
Kali wants to ride, wait to pay. There are no refunds or make-ups for prepaid
lessons.

Helen Peters

We'll take the lesson on the 25th at 11 am.  

Thanks,

I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached 
who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance 
discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was 
working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were 
anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the 
only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance 
sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back 
since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until 
several months later.

Susan W Pereira@ECT
11/14/2000 03:01 PM
Leslie-

When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  
Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach 
them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that 
HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL 
had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid 
them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I 
want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.

Thanks,

Susan

The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.  I asked 
you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its 
precursors.  You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the 
deal.  Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu??

Susan Pereira

Leslie Robinson@ENRON
11/10/2000 11:34 AM

Daniel Kieran with Cinergy/Producer's Energy called me because he wanted 
clarification on something in the contract.  He thinks were forgetting about 
the imbalance due LRP of 10,644.  I thought you said the reason the price was 
so low was because that imbalance had been taken into consideration, so in a 
sense we are netting the two.  Is this correct?  Also, was the Oryx imbalance 
of (770) taken into consideration in the agreement below?

Susan W Pereira@ECT
10/20/2000 03:15 PM
Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at 
$1.77/mmbtu.  Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 
to clear this imbalance.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

p.s.- you can just address the letter to Daniel Kieran

You can send it to me at 1904 Albans 77005. It is small and very mailable.  
Kali is such a good player and sweet girl - I know she is going to have fun  
no matter what. I think we all are going to miss the Micro Soccer days with  
small teams and more of a chance to get to know everyone! Have a great  
summer! Kathy

Stevens-

Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.  They are 
waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract.  
That should happen some time next week.  We will send you those numbers and 
the prices once we receive the final allocation.

Thanks,

We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:

We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
at Koch.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Nelson probably has most of the deals.  Here are mine for October with the 
sitara numbers-

Superior - Destin - 413970,413976
Superior - Mobile Bay - 413984,413992
Superior - Sonat - 415610,415613,415610
Hunt Oil - TGT - 410135
Vintage - Koch- no Oct deal but Sept deal was 380360
Ledco - Tenn - 415587
Santa Fe/Snyder - Stingray
Superior - Sea Robin - 227768

   
	
	

Scott Neal said the 4 of you were the best resources for the information I

information related to wellhead deals.

Thanks for your help.

I was wanting to know what the imbalances are booked at.  Are they all 
mark-to-marketed or valued at some historical pricing?  Also, can you work 
with LIG on the paperwork for settling the imbalance?

the other message was regarding.

It may be time for a drink!!

No problem.  What will we do when this thing is finally signed?

Looks good, Stacy.  Thanks for your help.

The IF term should be Nov.1, 2000 - Feb. 28, 2001.  Sorry if I messed up on

Thanks,

Susan, 
On your voice mail you said that the Gas Daily term was October 2000 and the

change the October pricing to the "Gas Daily".

Harvey Petter is keeping in contact with the dispatcher, but I want you to

Just checking to make sure Molly got the contract yesterday via email.  Let 
me know if she didn't.

Thanks

Susan Pereira

Stevens-

I just spoke to Stacy Dickson and she confirmed that the contract was mailed 
out a week ago.  She will e-mail it to Molly and mail it again regular mail.
Sorry for the delay.

The contract was mailed to Molly yesterday(9/11/00).  Let me know if she 
doesn't get it by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 09/12/2000 07:40:02 AM
Susan,

We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy "generate the
paper".  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.

If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.

Thank you,

Stevens

                    Susan.W.Pereira
Stevens-

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be
different.

I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 08/24/2000 07:54:00 AM

Susan,

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,
December.

Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.

Stevens

                    Susan.W.Pereira
Stevens-

Do you want to change the contract to reflect Gas Daily pricing for
September and Inside FERC pricing effective Oct & Nov?

Susan Pereira

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 08/22/2000 07:14:39 AM

As you can see the do not expect the plant to be up and running until after
Labor Day.

to be up and running in the next two weeks.

I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime.

Thanks,

Kathy-

Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a 
schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because 
her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another 
friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball 
girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those 
games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really 
was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall 
will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time 
and effort.

Susan Pereira

P.S.-
Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be

That sounds great!!  We're looking forward to the trip as well.  The kids are 
anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.  I don't know if 
there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, 
but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.  
Mayba a movie or two.  By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  
If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will 
especially enjoy it.

See you soon.

Love,

Hi Susan,
??? How's it going?? I  firmed up everything with the travel agent 
yesterday.? I still don't have a  price to give you because the hotel hasn't 
set one yet for the ground portion  (that's life in Brazil!), but it will be 
somewhere in the range that I had said  earlier.? 
??? Everything is all set and  reserved, and as soon as we have a price I'll 
purchase them.? So for the  time being don't worry about writing a check and 
I'll get back with you when  it's all finalized.? I'm really looking forward 
to having the kids return  with us and having you guys come down...it's going 
to be a lot of  fun!
??? Talk with you  soon..............Jan

Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little 
more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the 
girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have 
to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the 
attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? Glad you guys are going to  Foz, I think you'll really enjoy it.? Don't 
worry about giving me your  credit card number, etc.? It will be easier for 
me to pay for it from here  and then you can just reimburse us.? In fact, you 
can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.
??? I'm taking the Girl Scouts on  an all day outing today to an indian 
village so I won't talk with the travel  agent today.? However,? I'll call 
her and then tomorrow go by and  finalize everything.? Afterwards I'll send 
you all of the  details.
??? Hope your week goes  well.......give the kids a big hug.
??? Jan

PS? Just a reminder to get your visas, I  don't know if you have done that 
already.

Hi Susan,
??? Went by the travel agent's  today to see what she found for your trip to 
Foz.? I'm still waiting on  some confirmed prices but a strong estimate would 
be between R$1,000 to R$1,300  and depending on the exchange it would be 
between US$500 and US$650 per  person.? The price includes airfare, hotel 2 
nights, complimentary  breakfast all mornings, transport from and to airport, 
english speaking guide  and driver (he also takes you to the Argentina side), 
tours on the Brazil and  Argentina sides, boat tour at the bottom of the 
falls, and a tour of the aviary  of tropical birds of Brazil.? There's also a 
helicopter tour you can take  but it's not included in the price.? This is 
with TAM airline.?  
??? We would stay in Rio Sunday,  Monday and then on Tuesday you and Renato 
would leave Rio around 11am and arrive  in Foz around 2:30 and get to the 
hotel around 3:30.? You would spend all  day Wednesday there and leave 
Thursday at 3:30 to arrive in SP at  5:00PM.
??? When she confirms the prices  I'll send you all the details.? Until then, 
let me know what you think of  this so far.

I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.  
I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to 
do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info the first 
week in May.  Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session 
there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.  I think Anna 
Edelman is also interested.  I left a message with Sue today letting her know 
that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm 
doesn't work.

Thanks,

I can meet anytime after 11:00 am tomorrow, between 11 and 12 on Wednesday,

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system.
 
Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over 
to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more 
flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention 
an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.
 
I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of 
you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.  
Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of 
you:
 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being 
that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this 
profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***
 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

Thank you,

Susan,

I hear you are covering for Andy Ring the next couple of weeks.....

We only had two NYMEX match-ups for April, one with ABG Gas Supply (sitara 
#700336) and one with El Paso Merchant.
Andy entered them in Sitara, and I was able to find the deal with ABG Gas 
Supply, but can not find the deal with El Paso.
Could you or somebody in your group possibly find the relevant deal-number ?

I appreciate your help !

Regards,
Ellen

As for the BTU issue, Joe has talked with the Destin people several times 
about it.  They said they were going to get with Kahuna and straighten things 
out.  Joe will call again today.  Sorry about the delay, but we really have 
no control over it.

Dear Mr. Junek-

Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES 
offshore firm contract is now on your book.  Scott thinks that it is 
volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.  The wellhead desk will take 
this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.

Sincerely yours,

Susan (aka "the bitch")

Thanks for your help, Jan.  Renato just got home late last night.  I'll have 
to inform him of our travel plans!!

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Hi Susan,
    I would think that 2 nights , 3 days is plenty for Rio.  We could arrive
Sunday  see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying
beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out
for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early
Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're
not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two
nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around
the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston
that evening.
    Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you
have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All
of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get
there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do
decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow
some of ours.
    The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she
finds.
I'll be in touch.............Jan

Jan-

I was looking at the wrong week.  Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my 
only excuses.  How much time should we spend in Rio?  Should we leave for Foz 
on the 11th?  I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.  
That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.  I'll work on Renato 
when he gets back in town.  

Thanks,

Susan

Hi susan,
??? Glad to hear that you're  interested in the Foz.? I think it would be a 
great trip for you to take,  although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th 
and 5th.? Don't forget,  the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the 
week of June 30 til July  7th.? If we stick to the original schedule we would 
all be getting into  S?o Paulo Saturday the 7th.? The driver would pick up 
you and Renato  and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before 
us.?  
???? What could easily work  is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, 
spend a few days there and  then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz 
from Rio and the kids and I would  drive back to s?o Paulo.? You guys could 
then fly into S?o  Paulo from Foz.
??? The hotel I would suggest at  the Foz is the Cataratas.? It's located 
within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the 
national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.? They might offer 
a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? 
If not you just take a  taxi or car service.? 
??? When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming 
pools, large grounds, pond  etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our 
kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for 
the other.........too much  walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two 
of you I  think.
??? I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find 
out.? I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can 
find on it here.
??? I'll be in touch  soon..Jan
PS? Let Renato know that just finished  having a workout room built at the 
house.? Also, he can enjoy some great  running in front of the beach while 
you're in Rio --?? so hopefully he  won't suffer too much withdrawal 
!.................have a good  one

Jan-

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

Susan

Thanks.  See you on Thursday.

We have a shirt and we really want her to be a part of the team- I know that
the format -- with practices with 2 teams combined with Spring Break and bad
weather have made it a little difficult to have the same feeling that we all
did with our little micro teams but I know she would like the other girls on
the team and have fun! I'll make sure Roy brings her shirt to practice on
Thursday. Thanks for letting me know about this and we''ll work together to
amok this fun for her! Kathy

Staff has received the following RFP documents.

Civic Design
Wilbur Smith Associates
Vernon G. Henry and Associates

I will be leaving you a copy of the RFP at your house this evening.

As three days is required for public posting, staff would like to schedule a
meeting of members to review and score the written proposals.

Would you be available on May 21, 22 or 24?  A budget workshop with council
is scheduled for May 23.

Interviews are scheduled for May 29.

Please advise staff as to these available dates for you.  I would be more
than happy to e-mail the other members based upon your comments.

dnm  

Kathy-

I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the 
exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going 
away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a 
uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt 
and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

David-

Is the meeting on for April 2?  

Susan

David Moss <CityMgr@southside-place.org> on 03/21/2001 12:03:22 PM
>  -----Original Message-----

Ok, here's the plan.....

Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the 
evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we 
can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later 
I guess.

Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, 
arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the 
next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do 
Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a 
few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel 
reservations there?

Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't 
wait.

Susan

I would like to have a spot in the new garage.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your 
mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long 
distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't 
already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the 
kids liked it.

I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was 
wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, 
when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling 
without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would 
be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to 
Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to 
reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, 
let me know.  That's certainly more important.

Talk to you soon.....

Susan

In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.  
He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.

Susan

   

Susan, Are you interested in imbalance trading for VGS?
Brenda,
Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead 
production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way 
we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at 
what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on 
Venice.  

Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead 
production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.  

Brenda H Fletcher
03/22/2001 09:30 AM
Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed 
out the January  volume of <19,385> at $6.8121 for a total credit of 
$132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  <4455> and to trade 
the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of 
March.

There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran 
for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of 
invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to 
have cashout tickets entered for VGS?

If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the 
invoice, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Brenda

I did make a minor adjustment which you'll need to  know about when

probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few 
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with 
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In 
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  

Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need 
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.

Thanks,

Susan

P.S.-
Please email me back today at our home email address :  
pereira@houston.rr.com.  I'm leaving early for a doctor appt.

Julie-

I left my paperwork in the green box at your doorstep yesterday.  I wanted to 
make sure you received it.  I'll be out of town until March 25, so if you 
have any questions, I won't be able to respond until then.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Stevens-

We've moved up the food chain at Destin, but have not received a response 
yet.  I'll be out next week.  Check with Joe Casas to see if he hears anything

Susan,

I know you are quite busy with other items, but have you had time to
discuss the BTU protest with the Enron attorneys?  As I told you before,
Rebel would be more than happy to write "the letter", but I believe it will
have to be submitted by Enron as the shipper.

Thanks,

Stevens

Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back 
in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
April to get seats.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

P.S.-  Happy Birthday early!!

Margaret-

Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's 
class booth--all at different times.  I don't think we'll  be able to help 
all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than 
happy to help Mary out.

Dear Second Grade parents, 

Our class booth is the pinata booth and the booth chair is Mary Rothwell. 
?As  
you may know, she is expecting a baby in early April. ?She is still willing  
to run the booth and prepare the pinatas before the fair but will need  
someone to help her that day since she will have her newborn with her. ? 
Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:00  
with cleanup. ?During F& F hours from 11:00 - 3:00 her helper would need to  
help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,  
etc. ?There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not 
been  
filled - one slot from 1:00 - 2:00 and two slots from 2:00- 3:00. 

Could any of you help with any of this? ?If so, please email me and I will  
let her know. 

Thanks! 
Margaret Pierce

Is it safe to assume that practice is cancelled for tonight??

I need 2 cases of Thin Mints and 6 packages of Shortbread.  I'm planning to

Thanks for the birthday card.  I had a fairly quiet birthday.  I went to work 
that day and went out to dinner that night.  
Hope you are all doing well.  We're all fine, but very busy!!!

Is soccer practice on for tonight?  It looks like it might be raining then.  
Also, for the game on Sunday, what time do you want everyone to be there?

Thanks

Stevens,

Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.  Once we talk to 
the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would 
be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.  I'll let you know as 
soon as I know...

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 02/28/2001 04:05:40 PM
Susan,

I have told Rebel that you and I have discussed the BTU issue and the
complaint.  Harvey Petter with Rebel has offered to draft a letter.  Would
this be acceptable for you?  If it meets with Enron's approval it could be
sent by your office.  It might save you and your attorneys a lot of time,
but that is not how you might want to handle it.

Let me know.

Stevens

This will serve as my confirmation.

Laura wrote her name on the tissue paper because she forgot a card. Her gift
was the bath bag with the lip gloss.
Sorry for the confusion. That's great about the cookie sales. Did Karen
George tell you that someone gave us a $20.00 donation as well!

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set
in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.

I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just 
for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids 
are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group 
lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the 
classes large?

We are doing a very small camp on the 19th. From 1-3, under 10 kids. Would
she like to join us?

Helen Peters

Helen-

Since we last emailed, something has come up on Sunday afternoon.  Would it 
be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?  Or, Kali has 
Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Sounds good. Kali at 3PM.

Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the 
exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to 
deposit in your account.  

I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the 
medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali 
and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks.  
They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.

See you soon..

Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  

I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...

Hello U of Chicago Recruiting Team,

I am about to bombard you with all of the resumes that have been submitted 
for summer internship with Enron..  We are needing to choose 12 candidates to 
invite, with about six alternates.  We are having two schedules which means 
that will be interviewing 24 people total.  The Career Placement office 
requires that 50% of you list be open for bid, therefore 12 candidates will 
be open.

I am going to forward the e-mails that have the resumes attached. Please 
review and choose 12 invites and 6 alternates.

I am also going to forward the teams commitment to participation as it stands 
so far.

We will be needing 4 interviewers day one and 2 on day two.

Let us try and meet on Tuesday to discuss the resumes.  We need to have our 
choices to the Career Placement Office.  Please let me know what time is good 
for Tuesday.

Thanks -=- Paul L.

6:30  
until 7:40pm at Pershing on the large field. I understand that there will be  
one other U-8 girls team there with us and that there will be a trainer. I  
think the games may start on Sunday, Feb 18th but that is not confirmed yet.  
But our first practices with be on Thursday, Feb15th! We can't wait to meet  
all of the girls! Kathy Harrison and Roy Pruden

Good news!! Joe was able to adjust the Tuesday time. Please read his email 
below. 

Jim Goodyear's and Bernard Murphy's teams are assigned to the Tuesday 
practice at Pershing Middle from 5:30 to 6:30. 

Jon Reed's and Roy Pruden's teams are assigned to the Thursday practice at 
Pershing Large from 6:30 to 7:40. 

Also, I have assigned Brooks Leavell to Roy Pruden's team (please contact 
her, her phone # is 713-521-2336, mother Harriet).

I have assigned Shana Davis to Jim Goodyear's team (please contact her, 
mother Sheri, Home 713-529-7772, office 713-522-6441).

I will be forwarding a revised team list to Tom Troll shortly.? Thanks! 
Pamela 

Sorry for delay, it's been real busy.? On the practice schedules, the only 
switch I have made is to put the 2? 7:40 sessions back to 5:30 to 6:30.? 
Assuming they will have smaller attendance, I am asking Nebo to only schedule 
1 trainer for each session.? We will plan on using half of the Pershing 
middle field unless the Pershing Large field is empty. 

See how this works, I am putting this into effect with Nebo's trainers unless 
I hear any objections by tomorrow evening.? Let's plan on charging $40 per 
player for the Spring, no matter how many sessions they attend.? And remind 
them that they can attend any day or session if they miss theirs.? If any get 
too crowded, we'll adjust the trainer situation. 

M? -?? U-6?? 5 teams 30 kids Pershing Large 6:30-7:40?? 2 trainers 
T?? -?? U-7B? 3 teams 18 kids possibly 1 U-8? 7-8 kids? Pershing L 6:30-7:40 
2 trainers 
T? -?? U-8G? 2 teams 20 girls? Pershing Middle 5:30-6:30? 1 Trainers

Thanks, Joe 

Dave-

There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
down on trades made in error.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

I don't have any issues.

Thanks,

Susan

   

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

Dear Class Parents, 

The class will have their last Math Explorations class this Friday from 10

necessary. ?It is a great way to get to know your child's classmates and to  
see how your child interacts with the class.

The three indices are 9.81,9.89 and 9.97;  the average is $9.89.  So, the 
contract price is $9.89 + .01 less .2422 transport on the net of fuel 
volumes.  If you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value 
of the fuel (0.3%).

Susan and John:

Staff would like to reschedule the tentative Tuesday P & Z meeting.

City council members are also set to meet on this date for a elevated
tower/cell tower workshop.

I had envisioned a 30 minute meeting with P & Z members to finalize the last
remaining item (driveway distance from right-of-way) at the Tuesday meeting
before council's workshop.

However, I have since received a letter and sketch from CenterAmerica
concerning the demolition of Weiner's.  CenterAmerica is proposing a 3 to 4
story development consisting of retail on the first floor and a self-storage
facility on the remaining floors.

Staff would like to begin discussion with P & Z on this CenterAmerica
proposed project.

Would you be available on either Wednesday (February 7) or Thursday
(February 8) at
7:00 P.M. for a longer meeting?

dnm

       

I can be there.

Sorry about that! I've been sick and I guess I forgot. We had the show last
weekend so it was pretty hectic around here too.

This weekend, Sat or Sun at 3PM should be fine. Let me know which works for
you.
I don't want to promise too far in advance because of the erratic party
schedule.

I am resending this, as I have not received any reply.

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Thanks for keeping up with that, Chris.

I changed the Egan volumes for the 30th and 31st from 2599 to 4793 on the 
30th and 4794 on the 31st.  This empties out our storage.

Ruth-

I've been trying to call you back since last night, but your line is always 
busy.  I'd be happy to drive on Saturday.  Shall I call everyone?  Other than 
Jazz and Kali, I'll need to pick up Francie, Angela and Amy, right?  Any more?

Thanks,

Susan

At the Enron camp, how are the age groups combined?  For example, are 5-7 
year olds together, 8-10 year olds, etc....?

sort our troop's recognitions (troop 12357)  by Tuesday evening, I would
love to come by and pick them up.? Our  last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday
afternoon, and I wanted to get  everything to our troop leader Wednesday

Have you sent any confirmation to El Paso stating our agreement with the 
imbalance and that it has been transferred to ENA?

Susan

Leslie Robinson@ENRON
01/08/2001 08:43 AM
Koch has sent payments. LIG said they sent it but that was a month ago, so 
I've followed up and am waiting to hear from Bud Elkins.  That imbalance of 
11,973 due Stingray is correct but is no longer on LRP's books, it's been 
assigned to ENA.  Thanks.

Susan W Pereira@ECT
01/05/2001 12:53 PM
Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.  

Thanks,

Whoops!  I goofed.  The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel 
value) is $.2602.  The transport deduct on net volumes is $.2422.

Sorry for the confusion.

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 01/04/2001 11:38:51 AM
Susan,

Joe Casa is supplying the volumes to the Gas Plant, could you please give
me the price for December?

Thank you,

Stevens

My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF 
indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  

The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 
0.3% fuel.
The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% 
fuel.

Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in 
mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this 
production.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Could you please forward me a copy of November Daily Gas Prices for the
Bazor Ridge Treating Facility.  I am responsible for filing the monthly
production reports for Rebel Drilling with the Mississippi Oil & Gas Board.
IF you have any questions, please feel free to call me at  713-374-2532.

Thanks,
Kim  Dillard

Stevens-

I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The 
transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This 
should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation 
contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for 
redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes 
at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you 
must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in 
transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from 
gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec.   
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Susan Pereira

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 12/07/2000 02:05:57 PM
Susan,

Do you have any idea when we will receive volumes and pricing for the Bazor
Ridge Gas Plant for November?  If I need to contact someone else concerning
these issues please let me know.

Thanks,

Stevens

Jane-

I've corrected  the transport and fuel deducts in sitara and e-mailed the 
EOTT  folks.

Thanks

Susan

Stevens_Hollister@eott.com on 12/12/2000 09:10:36 AM
Susan,

Jane Saladino, an accountant with Enron, called the EOTT accountant to let
her know that the transportation on Bazor Ridge should be $.25, rather than
$.24.  Is this correct?

Stevens

I think we've got the prices right in our system now.

Susan

Susan,

I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in the
"system"  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

Thank you,

Stevens

Hi, Connie!  

The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.

As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  

Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet, though.  

We went to a dude ranch in Bandera, TX for Thanksgiving weekend.  The kids had a blast and want to go back next year.  

I guess I'll be updating my resume this weekend.  It looks pretty bleak.

Talk to you soon.

Susan  

hey Susan,

How is it going this week?  I heard that people are mostly sitting around
during the morning then going to bars in the afternoon...or is that just in
the London office?  Are people even coming into the office?  Heather Kendall
said she will be let go just before Christmas.  I can't believe how they are
laying people off just before Christmas, the whole scenerio is like a bad
movie.  She's coming to visit this week, so maybe we can cheer her up with
some Christmas shopping in Rothenburg, it's an adorable little mid-evil town
that has the greatest Christmas decoration stores ever...and they are open
year round.  We took Julie there when she was here a couple of weeks ago.

How are the kids doing?  Does Kali still believe in Santa Claus?  We are
going to spend Christmas with Melissa and family.  Christmas is just not
much fun without children to watch.  Armin needs a vacation, well we both
do.  We leave on Dec 21 and CAN'T WAIT TO GO!  Are ya'll staying home for
Christmas?

Well, just wanted to check on you!  Take care...connie

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
ur millions.....

Susan Pereira
ENA Gas Trader

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Patrick Tucker

Still here, but don't know for how long...

I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.  Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.  I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.  We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.  I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....

Oh, well.  We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.  

Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.

Hope everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  Merry Christmas!!

Take care,

Susan

Are you there?  Is anyone there?

Just checking on you....
connie

I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.  We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.  There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.  If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.  There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.  I guess those will happen.  I don't know.  They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.  Stay tuned....

Dear Susan

What's happening now?  It's all over the international news that Enron will
not make it.  what are they saying to the employees?

Thinking about you!
connie

Craig-

You might want to talk to Ormet concerning deliveries for December.  It is very likely we may have to default to them for December.  We have NYMEX length and may be able to use some hub gas to transport to Ormet.  I don't know which deals will be served first.

Susan Pereira

That's fine, Stevens.

Susan,

It is my understanding that Enron will not be receiving gas on Destin
pipeline in the month of December.  Therefore we have made arrangements to
sale the gas to another party.  If I have misunderstood the situation,
please advise.

Stevens

Sounds like a great idea, Ana.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Hello -
 
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.
 
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.  I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.  If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.
 
Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).  They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.  Their hours  are:
 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m.
Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m.
Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m.
Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.
 
Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.  You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.  I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.  If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.
 
The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.
 
Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.  You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.  They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.
 
If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.  I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.   Thanks!

Guess what?  I got a response from Ken on my email to him.  In fact, he responded just a few days after I wrote him, but his assistant didn't send it back to me until today.  He hand wrote a response on the printout of my email.

Susan,

Just wanted to let you know about the update concerning the cash out pricing....

I wanted to let you know that the filing by Texas Gas Transmission to use GAS DAILY pricing for cashout  was REJECTED by FERC.    So please disregard the cashout information that was included on the PIPELINE SUMMARY you received at our meeting last Monday.
TGT submitted another new filing which proposes using weekly averages in Natural Gas Week and also proposes changing the tiers.  TGT wants to implement this retroactive to October1st.   Numerous entities have filed oppositions to this proposed TGT tariff change.     So at this time,  the method to be used by TGT for cashouts is uncertain.   
I will let you know when a cashout methodology gets final approval by FERC.

Hello -
 
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.
 
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.

I've left a message with my contact at Vintage.  I haven't heard back yet.  I do know that in Oct and Nov the gath. fee is .0981.

I'll let you know when I find out about Sept.

Thanks,

Good Morning Susan,

Jan Laird with Vintage Gas sent the attached e-mail.  Please review and advise.

Thanks,

Valerie, the gathering deduct for SLN 2883 (Gwinville) is  .0268  instead of  .0981.

   Valerie, please fax the upabove detail  to (918) 878-5383.  Thanks!

I've forwarded your message to Christina Sanchez.  She was the one who reallocated the volumes.  She will look at it again.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks,

Susan

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

Thanks
Laurie
Laurie-

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, this the order that Superior says the August deals should be filled in.  Can you please review the email below with the spreadsheet I sent earlier and let me know.

Thanks
Laurie

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

Terry-

I can drive my Sequoia to practice and take 6 girls to Baskin Robbins as well.  Between you and me, that should be enough space for all the girls.

Susan

OK .  The girls got their mission accomplished and they will be treated to ice cream during the 2nd half of practice Wed.
I will bring my Suburban and take them to the Baskin and Robbins in the Randall's Shopping Center at Weslayan and Bissonnet. at about 8pm and you can pick them up there at the regular time of 8:30.

If you will notice they are progressing as a team right in line with what we have been teaching them.. They learned a little individual and team defensive tactics for the lst couple of weeks, so they started holding the oppositions scoring down to reasonable levels.  The last couple of weeks we have  been working strengthening their kicks, on finishing and on working crossing passes.  They have improved in all those areas. They gave us as many thrills as the Yankees on Sunday, so they now will get their just desserts.

I am trying to arrange a makeup for next Sun. and will let you know at practice.

Terry Lester

David-

After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.

Thanks,

Susan

Hi, fellow P&Z members.

I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with D=

when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the =

some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the =
City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along =
Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  T=
he proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.=
  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts E=
ckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative=
 fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc. =
 David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potenti=
al liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also,=
 there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to=
 be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us =
a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the li=
ne is in need of replacement anyway.

As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elev=
ations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's=
 reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing=
 center.

Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the add=
itional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the p=
arking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be availab=

David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to d=

Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disg=
usted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrenc=
e.=20

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC=
.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with=
 the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way a=
nd learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a=
 believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nose=
d, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and hel=
d on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometim=
es daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top execu=
tives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of r=
easons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compens=
ated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlement=
s, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in th=
e Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew so=
mething we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us=
 that Enron was going to be the "World's Leading Company."  He even put the=
 goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in Februa=
ry how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the c=
ynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was h=
opeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that =
high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e.,=
 +/- 20%. =20

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more option=
s.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afr=
aid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have ma=
ny working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my sa=
vings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their=
 entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking =
forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let m=
e remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less t=
han a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Ot=
her employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for t=
heir children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and=
 the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the =
industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeleton=
s in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees=
 and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumb=
o-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your co=
horts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending yo=
ur millions.....

Go with Vintage's numbers on the spreadsheet.  I have corrected the sitara ticket.  I think the problem might have been that I forgot to adjust the fuel value from the previous month.  Sorry for the mistake.

Russ,

Can you please remap KOCH/Zone 4 Area 3/000464 to IF-Tetco/ELA and GDP-Tetco/ELA?

This meter was remapped to this curve last month but there were many changes on the KOCH pipeline between zones on October 1st, could that be why the mapping was changed back to the original curve?

Susan, this fix can't be done until tonight as it takes overnight to take effect.  You should see the impact in tomorrow night's P&L.

Dear Mr. Jackson-

I am writing to request that the City of West U postpone the proposed work at Colonial Park until at least late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association  practice at the field from February through May every year.  At this late notice, it would be very difficult for WUSA to find a replacement field near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months??  West U prides itself on its focus on community and families; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira

Dear Mr. May-

I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.  WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U.  What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?  West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.  What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
713-349-8836  

Thanks for your support!

Susan Pereira

Could not agree more and carried that argument during the meeting in
which the proposed plans were presented at Council.  Other than Marilyn
Griffin, I received no vocal support or indications of such from the
other members including the mayor.  I hope your comments are sent to
them as well.

I would also encourage you to closely examine the proposed changes to
Colonial Park (a nuance transformation from a Community Park to a
Neighborhood Park) and cost.

With the YMCA coming into city ownership next year, there should be no
problem with INDEFINITELY postponing construction at Colonial Park until
youth activities currently ongoing at Colonial can be transferred to the
YMCA.

thanks,

mike

Dear Ms. Griffin-

I would like to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 neighborhood girls involved in West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park February through May every year.  It will be difficult for WUSA  to find an alternative site on such short notice, especially near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months?  West U prides itself on being family- and community-minded; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Dear Mr. Farley-

I am writing to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field at Colonial Park from February through May every year.  If not allowed to use the field, WUSA will have a very difficult time finding a suitable replacement on such short notice, especially near West U.  What harm can it do to postpone the work a couple of months?  West U is a city focused on families and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space??

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
713-349-8836

Mayor Lewis-

I would like to recommend strongly that the City of West University postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  At least 50-60 girls (ages 6-8) in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in Colonial Park from February through May each year.  What harm can it do to postpone the work so that the girls can play there this upcoming season?  If the field is unavailable in 2002, it will be very difficult to find suitable practice sites on such short notice, especially near West U.  West U is all about family and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?

Sincerely,

Laurie-

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, this the order that Superior says the August deals should be filled in.  Can you please review the email below with the spreadsheet I sent earlier and let me know.

Thanks
Laurie

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the
following order:

Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354

Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.
I'll let you know what I find.

I will not be able to participate in the Chicago recruiting efforts.  Can you please remove my name from your group email list?

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Chicago Team -
Recruiting season has begun and you will be receiving weekly updates from me about the status of events at Chicago.

Last week Mitch Taylor gave a presentation about the energy industry and Enron's position in it to the first years.  It was a great turn out and I have received several emails about how great the presentation was.

Our summer intern received a full time offer and it is still outstanding.  The deadline date is fast approaching so I encourage you to contact her and sell Enron!  Her info is as follows:  Helen Wei - hwei@gsb.uchicago.edu.

Below are the upcoming events and the participants I have scheduled for each event.  As you can see, we still need some people in key places.  Please let me know if you are available.  If your calendar has changed, please notify me as soon as possible so we can find a replacement.  Otherwise, you will receive an event sheet one week prior to the event with hotel confirmation numbers and other details.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.

q	October 5th - Presentation to Energy Group - TBD
?	Participants: 	Jeff Donahue, Mitch Taylor, Terrell Benke, Boon Lua, Beth Miertschin
		Need 1 or 2 more people

q	October 5th - Sponsorship of GSB Brats 'n Brew
?	Participants: 	Jeff Donahue, Mitch Taylor, Terrell Benke, Boon Lua, Beth Miertschin
	Need 1 or 2 more people
	
q	October 15th  - Corporate Presentation, 6:30 - 8:00 PM
?	Participants: 	Jeff Donahue (speaker), Mitch Taylor, Jean Mrha, Louie Fischer, Ed Hamb, Beth 			Miertschin

q	November 5th  - First Round Interviews on campus, 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM

q	November 6th  - Second Round Interviews on campus, 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM
	      ?	Participants: 	Jeff Donahue, Mitch Taylor
		

Why are we at the 110% and not something less?   When is the 30 day period over?

Susan

Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:

Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 

Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.

I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.

I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira

P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks.

Hi, Connie!!  Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.  Things got busy. =
=20

The stock is still going down, but not as much.  It's at $13.92 right now, =
yippee!!!  I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.  I guess=
 I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get =
back to $45 or $50 until then.  There aren't any new businesses for Enron t=
o get into to make the stock analysts excited.  All the money we're making =
in trading is apparently not doing it for them. =20

Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?  It might =
be hard to get a concrete case against them.  I'm sure some of them are in =
the same boat as the rest of us.  Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think =
Wall Street wants Ken Lay's head on a platter.  I'm sure the stock analysts=
 are really frustrated that Jeff Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would=
 have gutted him.  Old Skilling is just grinning in his new River Oaks mans=
ion.  I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.  I think I shoul=
d sign up for anger management classes. =20

As for my car purchase.... yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Se=
quoia.  I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balan=
ce.  Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's posit=
ion was superfluous.  This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Ente=
rgy-Koch trading merger.  They put him in between Renato and his former bos=
s, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.  Entergy-Koch i=
s so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.  The guys=
 working for Renato are sick about it.  The upper management at Entergy-Koc=
h has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike=
 ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process th=
at the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality. Of course, now, Ren=
ato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never co=
nsider going back.  They are paying him through the end of the year and ves=
ting him in all the savings plans.  They are also paying him a year's salar=
y, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.  He's been a=
ctively looking for a new job.  Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be worki=
ng until I'm 70!!

Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....

Susan

Dear Susan,

That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sur=
e
hope things are going better where Renato is working!

So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big
either.  I actually love those little "Smarts" have you seen them, I doubt
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has mor=
e
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finishe=
d
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seein=
g
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills an=
d
eating good!

Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell
Renato hello for me.

Take care,
Connie

This just in .... ENE at $11.31.....Good thing my guns are locked up!!

Susan

Oh, Susan, I can't believe that ENE is trading soooo low!  I am so sorry for
all of you there, hopefully a miracle will happen.  But you REALLY didn't
want to retire, did you?  You're WAY too young!  The bad thing about
marrying a man so much younger is, I probably won't retire until he does and
that may be awhile since we just started our own business this year and he's
only 31.  I don#t want anyone else being the CFO of MY company, but ME!  But
the good thing is having a full time cook/maid.

Well, I heard this morning that they are expecting more terrorist attacks
this week.  You all take care.  Are people that work at Enron flying as much
as they used too?

Well, I hate to hear that things are up in the air for Renato right now, but
sounds like he got a great package.  He will find something good in no time,
I'm sure..then you just have all that extra money!

We have some American guests visiting, my sister-in-law's, cousin's, 2 sons.
They are really nice guys, 19 and 21 and they have been soooo lucky with the
weather.  It's great!  Sunshine and warm, well warm for us...like 65?.  All
the leaves are turning right now, I hope the sunshine lasts a few more days.
They are off touring around town right now, there's so much to see right
here alone, then later in the week they are headed further south to see more
castles and stuff.

Well I have to go get some work done.  Hope things start looking up over
there SOON for you all!

Later,
connie

Valerie-

I just found out from Robert Eubank at Vintage that he was telling me the wrong thing for the gathering charges.  SLN 9205 has always had a .0981 gathering fee.  SLN 2883 gath. charges are as follows:  Sept. .0268, Oct .0628, Nov .0628.  I'll adjust the sitara tickets, but I'll have to weight average the gathering.  You'll need to fine tune it since you're dealing with the actual volumes from each wellhead point.

Thanks,

Susan

Good Morning Susan,

Susan

Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 & 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?

   Valerie, please fax the upabove detail  to (918) 878-5383.  Thanks!

My husband is no longer with Koch, but we do live in Southside.  We moved to Southside when it was the same price as West U.  We're definitely some of the poorer folks in Southside now......

But I thought your hubby was prez of Koch or something Brazilian? and figuring the passage of time and this Paulo's link to Brazil commodity fund? well I hope you didn't mind me asking?

Frank
PS By the way, don't you live in Southside?J

Nope, no relation.  We're only related to poor Pereiras!!

Susan

Are you related to Paulo Pereira?  I seem to remember something like that?

I tried to send this to your home email, but it was undeliverable.
I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.

Have a great holiday season.

Take care,

Susan Pereira

P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks.

You didn't offend me at all.  I wish I were related to someone on the Board of Directors...

Kam-

Is the Koch/Sabine interconnect already mapped to Sabine??

Susan

Russ,

Can you please remap Koch/Zone 2 Area 5/004708 (only this meter) to GDP-Colgulf/LA and IF-Colgulf/LA tonight after we calculate?

Melissa Videtto will call once she is finished.

Thanks

Kam

Yes, I will be there.  Is the trainer supposed to come tonight??

Susan

Susan,

I've been requested to attend a meeting with our girls U-15 trainer and some prospective players for tonight at 7:30.  I was just wondering if you would be coming to practice, and if you could cover for me.

Terry Lester

Laurie-

No. I have not put a new ticket in the system.  I wrote up a paper ticket and Alejandra Chavez adjusted the term  of the existing sitara ticket.  I'm not sure how it is supposed to be handled.  You might check with Alejandra and Kam Keiser.  Apparently, we've had some similar deals with other counterparties.  The NYMEX desk people told me that Credit doesn't want us paying one lump sum for unwinds.  Do you have any instructions concerning this, given our current financial situation??

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan, I just got an invoice from Superior for the unwinding of the Sonat trigger deal.  The invoice covers production months 12/01 through 08/02 and is for $3,761,900.00.  Have you put something in the system for this?

We support you 100%, Chris!!

I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.

Here are the deal numbers and volumes.

Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.

I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  

Thanks for your support.

Thanks, Laurie.

Susan

Susan, I just spoke to Alejandra.  They will be putting this in the system as an annuity to be settled by Financial Settlements.  I will forward the invoice to them.

I don't think anything has changed.  The transport rate is $.2421 + 0.3% fuel.  The pricing is the average + $.01.  I've emailed Tricia to see what the problem is.

Susan

Susan,

We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.

Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?

Is something in error or has the contract changed?

Thank you,

Stevens

   Susan,

   I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
   message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
   prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in
   the
   "system"  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
   different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

   Thank you,

   Stevens

Yes, Clinton is a sub of Enron.  As far as percentage of ownership, I am not 
familiar with those numbers.  However, I do know that Enron does guarantee 
their transactions.

Hello,

Debra, can you please forward by e-mail a copy of our GISB template to Robin 
for delivery to her customer for review.

Robin, our GISB is a standardized contract that very rarely contains any 
specific credit covenants.  I do not provide credit terms to Legal for GISB 
contracts and they do not keep me informed of any's execution.  Should you 
like to have your customer review an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale 
Agreement, I would more than happy to oblige with credit terms.  (note:  
Debra and the rest of the commodity legal group is attending a legal 
conference in Austin and will not be returning until Monday)

Debra,

Attached is the requested electronic version of the WPSC contract and
Corporate Guaranty sent to Enron 12/14.  Given the cold weather conditions,
WPSC is very anxious to get this agreement executed.  Hopefully, given the
time we all spent resolving contract issues, this contract can be executed
and sent to WPSC this week.

Please call me if you foresee any problem with this timetable.

Thanks,

Good Morning Bob and Happy Holidays to you -
In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, this
email confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreement
between your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.("CPS").
According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX,
Constellation Energy Source, Inc.("CES"), was previously handling all of the
wholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.  It is
expected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gas
trading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk located
within the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in an
attempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or the
termination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the most
feasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion.

ENA  has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potential
counterparties for gas trading in the year 2001.  CPS will initiate gas
trading as early as January 29th, 2001. Considering this, I am looking
forward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review and
consideration.  Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliest
convenience.

I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to our
request and look forward to working with you in the near future.  Do not
hesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request.
I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January
'01.

ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

 This Guaranty Agreement (this "Guaranty"), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation ("Guarantor
"), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ ("Contract 
Party").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor ("Obligor"), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the "Gas Contract"), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the "Obligations"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the "Indemnity Period").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the "Maximum Limit"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon

ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT
GUARANTY AGREEMENT
SAMPLE  FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY
 This Guaranty Agreement (this "Guaranty"), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation ("Guarantor
"), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ ("Contract 
Party").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor ("Obligor"), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the "Gas Contract"), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the "Obligations"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the "Indemnity Period").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the "Maximum Limit"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party,

described in Appendix "1" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.

FYI,

I have fully executed agreements on my desk for the following:

Proliance Energy, LLC
Energy Development Corporation
Willow Bend  Operating Company.

Ellen I am sending you confirms for these customers.

Debra Perlingiere

How is Gail?

Debra Perlingiere

Sorry to hear there is no improvement.    Please let me know if there is 
anything I can do.

Debra Perlingiere

Yes,  I have Monday off.  I am sure Kurt would be game for movies / hot 
dogs.   Are we the only three in town?  Where is Richard this weekend?  I 
will let you know.  I am waiting to see what happens on the baseball 
tickets.  

Debra Perlingiere

Paul,

A fully executed agreement will be placed in the mail today  for your 
records.  However,  Enron Corp.'s guaranty  has not been included as I await 
signature from the corporate office.  Upon receipt of same,  I will send an 
original for your records.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions or I can 
be of further assistance.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

I will prepare the draft as soon as I receive the worksheet.

Debra Perlingiere

Katalin,

At Shari Stacks request,  I am sending you sample  contracts of ENA's GISB 
and Master Agreement. Please feel free to give me a call with any questions.  
Also,  I will be the person who negotiates and drafts both agreements should 
you decide to go forward.

  

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Here is the TransAlta  draft.

Debra Perlingiere

Engage Energy Canada, LP and Engage Energy America LLC have requested master 
agreements with ENA.   I believe gty's are in already in place.   Please send 
me a worksheet for these to entities.

Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere

Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have 
been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction.  
Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements 
subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement 
subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not 
work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.  

Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further 
assistance.

Debra Perlingiere

With regards to our discussion on priority of contracts for 30 day firm 
transactions.  The system gives priority to Master Agreements over GISBs.   
All things equal,  a 30 day firm transaction will attach to the master before 
the GISB.

Hope this helps.

Debra Perlingiere

Marci said Julie, and Kyle are out I think.  You could try them.  What about 
Pat?  I have not seen him in a long time.  

Debra Perlingiere

Marcia,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses 
are as follows:

Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language.

Netting:  We suggest the following:  

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.

Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days.

Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For 
interruptible delivery there is no limit.

We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for 
your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts.    

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Dear WEN Members-2000:

We have not received your 2001 membership applications.  You are in danger of 
being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving 
monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see 
attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon
meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular
mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by
regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future
meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for
whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their
notices by regular mail.

Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached
meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon
since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you
approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would
be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward
the attached luncheon notice to them.

Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter
on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending
you your next newsletter in April.

For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future
to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We
value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly
appreciated.

Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN
members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900)
beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!

As an update,  I have prepared final draft of the GISB and pending my 
attorney's review.   I will contact you later this week.

Regards,

John,

The only remaining points at issue concerning the GISB are as follows:

Section 1.2   change to "Oral".  As you may recall in our previous 
discussion,  Enron will always send a written confirm.   

Section 10.1 supplement:  Agree to purposed language save "two day",  please 
revise to "5 business days".

If in agreement with changes above, please prepare final document and send 
for our execution.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.   

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere

In response to your Revised Cutter Oil contract:

1.   Ok
2.    What is the arrangement if not 100%?
3.   I suggest ,  30 days notice /  two business day notice for seller, as 
they must give some notice.
4.   Can you negotiate $.05 for damages?

Debra Perlingiere

YES !!!

Debra Perlingiere

just as you said,  the only thing we get is a recording.  I did e-mail the 
revisions to the Agreement as well.  do you have the name of another contact 
?  or you can leave a message that we will cut them off if there is not 
response in x# of days?  

Debra Perlingiere

Thanks.  Rest assured they will not see your work product.

Debra Perlingiere

Thanks,  I have received same and preparing a final draft for execution.

Debra Perlingiere

Debra Perlingiere

Your a most welcome.   I would like to see the doc they sign to see if they  
accepted our remarks.

Debra Perlingiere

no word

Debra Perlingiere

We are ok with your Addendum to the agreement.  However,  there remains 
Section 3.2,  we discussed earlier.  Because this is interruptible gas we 
prefer Spot Standard. 

Also,  with regards to the signatory.  Is Mr. Roy VP for Atmos Energy 
Corporation?

I will prepare an additional GISB for United Cities.  

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

FYI,  See you tomorrow night.

We have reservations for 7 p.m. tomorrow at Boudro's on the Riverwalk.  It 
comes highly recommended, and of course, the company will be wonderful!  We 
will need to leave La Cantera about 6:15 or 6:20, so let's plan to meet at 
6:15 at the front desk.  If this is somewhat ambiguous when we get there, 
then I'll leave word for you there or look for you.  See you!

What is the status of these to entities?  

Have we suspended trading with Crosstex?

 Are negotiations on going with Proliance?

Debra,

I am sorry for the long delay in responding.  In regard to the HPL
agreement, we'd like to submit a few requested changes for your
consideration, as follows:

1. Article 1.  Term.  We'd like to amend the initial term from one year to
one month.

2. Section 3.2 Subsections(i)& (ii).  Seller's Failure to Schedule.  In the
seventh line immediately after the word "the", delete the words "Replacement
Price Differential, plus (ii) liquidated damages equal to $0.15" and replace
with the words "Gas Daily Price".  In line nine immediately after the word
"Quantity", delete the words "to cover Buyer's administrative and
operational costs" so these 2 subsections now read as follows: (i)an amount
equal to the product of the Seller's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the
Gas Daily Price multiplied by Seller's Deficiency Quantity".

3. Section 3.4 Subsections (i) & (ii).  Buyer's Failure To Deliver.  In the
twelfth line delete the words "Replacement Price Differential, plus (ii)
liquidated damages equal to $0.15" and replace with the words "Gas Daily
Price".  In line thirteen immediately after the word "Quantity" delete the
words "to cover Seller's administrative and operational costs" so these 2
subsections now read as follows: (i) an amount equal to the product of
Buyer's Deficiency Quantity multiplied by the Gas Daily Price multiplied by
Buyer's Deficiency Quantity."

4. Section 4.1 Early Termination. Subsection (i).   We'd like to reduce the
number of days in which notice can be given of the termination of the
transaction(s) upon a Triggering Event from 60 Days to 10 Business Days.  In
line six immediately after the word "which" delete the words "any or".  In
line seven immediately after the word "Transactions" delete the words
"selected by It and" and replace with the word "under", so this subsection
now reads as follows: "(i) upon two Business Days written notice to the
first Party, which notice shall be given no later than 10 Business Days
after the discovery of the occurrence of the Triggering Event, establish a
date on which all Transactions under this Agreement in respect thereof will
terminate..."

5. Section 4.2 Triggering Event. Subsection (i) We'd like to limit the cure
period during which an Affected Party is able to remedy a payment failure
from five (5) Business Days to two (2) Business Days.

6. Section 8.2 Transfer.  In line five immediately after the word "may"
delete the words "without the" and replace with the words "with written".

7. Appendix 1.  Definitions  "Material Adverse Change" definition.  Delete
subsection (ii) in its entirety and replace with the following definition,
"(ii) with respect to Customer, its Guarantor's Credit Rating is below
"BBB-" by S&P or its Guarantor fails to have a Credit Rating from S&P.  If
there is no Credit Rating for Customer's Guarantor, then Material Adverse
Change with respect to Customer means: its Guarantor shall have any of the
following occur at any time: (a) its Net Worth falls below U.S.
$200,000,000, or (b) its Funded Debt to Net Worth at any time exceeds forty
percent (40%).  (This language was recently approved by both parties and is
included in the Bandwidth Master Agreement between Enron Broadband Services,
L.P. and Aquila Broadband Services, Inc.)

Please call me (816-527-1560, or e-mail me upon your review of the above
requested changes.  If possible, we'd like to get this agreement executed
within the next couple of weeks.

Thanks so much!

Kathleen,

Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm
Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit
department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit
department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila
requested the attached drafts.

Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL
agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993)
between ENA and Aquila.

Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between
Enron and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not
included.

I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.
Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our "approved" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the "bandwidth" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!

terms.  Having said that,  I have sent your attachment to credit for

Further to our conversation,  please see attach resume.  Thanks!!

Debra Perlingiere

Further to our conversation, please see attachment regarding warranty and 
netting.
Disregard the section on "Non-Warranted Gas" as this does not apply to our 
negotiations.

Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an 
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each 
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to 
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater 
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the 
amounts owed.

Best regards,
Debra Perlingiere

This looks fine.  However,  I wanted to let you know  we do not  sign the 
Appendix as it is incorporated into the agreement.  I will print and send to 
your for execution.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

John,

One final change with your OK.  Regarding section 7.5  last sentence, delete 
after "be"  and add "paid."  The sentence will read,  "Upon resolution of 
such dispute, any amounts owing will be paid."
Please advise.

Many thanks,

Although the Clark County gas deal is moving slower than I'd like it to, it 
is very much a live deal.  Thanks to all of you for your patients and 
assistance thus far.  Its being held up by the Master Agreement which their 
credit representative (Reid Grossmann) will be working on it AGAIN tomorrow.  
He will be in Houston and asked if he might meet with Debra and Jay in 
person.  He has assured me that our issues are being taken care of today.  
Since they still have some of their own issues, he is of the opinion that 
nothing can happen before Friday.  I intend to keep the heat on them and 
fully anticipate they will - at some point - transact.

Debra - 

We've been tasked with creating a customer database and cultivating some new 
clients.  I will be covering the state of Wisconsin.  I need to know if the 
attached companies have Master Physicals or GISBs with ENA.

Sorry to be a pain and I don't need it this afternoon - but if you could fill 
it in as whenever you get a chance, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks -

Is it correct to say that no confirmation was sent by ENA or Southwest for

Christy, I am going to speak with Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal to obtain 
the most recent version of the Master between ENA and Transcanada Energy 
Marketing USA, Inc. and will forward it when I receive it.  I also will check 
into the status of that unexecuted Master as it may be that we can assist in 
getting both executed at the same time.  Thanks.

James, thanks for the info.  Yes, I agree they should be the same.  Is there 
a chance I could get a copy of the one ENA sent out to them, not only would 
it show me how ENA worded certain things but would show me where ENA and EES 
agreements are different, so I can make sure we have same info.  If you could 
send me a copy of ENA's proposal to TransCanada that would be helpful.

Thanks. Christy

Christy, attached please find the Master Purchase and Sale Information 
Worksheet for TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Please note that Russell Diamond and Veronica Espinoza have been working on 
executing a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement with the same counterparty on 
behalf of ENA.  I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master 
Worksheet to remain consistent.  My understanding from talking with Veronica 
and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed.

In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued 
benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  In addition, TransCanada Pipelines 
Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf 
of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.  

Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it 
will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.  Please let 
me know how the status of the Master progresses or if you need my assistance 
to facilitate.  Thanks for your help.

Dear Debra:

Our proposed restatement of Section 13.10 is as follows:

"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to receive gas from NEGM because such Repurchaser has been affected by an
event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term
"Transporter" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in
Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of
a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract
will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received
from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."

I look forward to hearing from you.  Best regards, Beth Webb

Gary,

I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows:

Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming 
party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of 
Law we will agree to  New York or Texas.

Special Provisions:

1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording.
2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows:
   In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in 
the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.   

As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery 
for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible 
service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I 
suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or 
alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need 
for the GISB.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would 
like to proceed.   

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

We will not agree to the use of the GISB for firm delivery past 30 days.   I 
will get in touch with  Lucci to discuss a master agreement.   To  speed 
things along I will attach a sample of our master for your review.   Pending 
credits review,  we could send you a draft as early as Monday .

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

I have been in contact with your customer Greely regarding a GISB and or 
Master.   It is my understanding they wish to trade firm long term  (1 year 
or greater)   I have related to them ENA will not go past 30 days on firm 
delivery with a GISB and suggest consideration of a Master.

Please advise how you want to proceed.

Dan says,  Cutter in acting as "Representative" for Harley,  would receive 
payments from Enron.   With regards to deals,  deals with Harley at different 
prices is ok.  

Concerning FM,  Harley could claim FM for delivery to the meter.

Marcia,

I have completed my review of the revised Special Revisions my remarks are as 
follows:

We do not agree to the first paragraph.

1. Agreed
2. Agreed
3. Agreed
4. Agreed
5. Agreed
6. Agreed with change in wording.'
7. Agreed

We do not agree to suggested addition of Sections 10.3 and 10.4.

9 and 10.  Agreed
11. Agreed
12. Agreed
13. We do not agree to this language.

Because the Special Provisions are part of the agreement there is no need for

Debra - 

We currently only have a GISB with Wisconsin Electric (WEPCO) and they are 
interested in buying some term gas - so I would like to send them a Master.  
Can you pull one together for them?

They are a subsidiary of Wiscinsin Energy.

Thanks -

THANKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Beth,

We will agree to this version with the following changes:

"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such 
Delivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term "Transporter" 
when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1. 
and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter 
for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to 
invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such 
Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."

Please let me have your thoughts.

Sorry,  I am unable to help you with your gas bill.   I suggest you try the 
following:

Depending on where our live (ie city or supplier),  contact the supplier 
regarding your rates, and have your meter checked.  Also you might request 
the supplier check their line to your home.

Debra,

I think this just takes us back to your Feb. 22 proposal.  Since the second
sentence seems to be somewhat problematic for Enron, we will withdraw our
request for that sentence.  My only other change would be that the ".1"
appearing after the "4" and the "11" in the last sentence should also be
deleted.

Hopefully this will resolve the issue.

Best regards,  Beth

Beth,

We will agree to this version with the following changes:

"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force
majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be
entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such
Delivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term "Transporter"
when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1.
and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter
for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply
to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such
Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the
same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."

The message did not attach the document the first time...

Debra,

Attached below is a slightly revised Mac language for the Aquila Master.  
After speaking to Aquila today, we should execute both HPL and ENA Masters 
simultaneously (as both documents were sent over for their review at the same 
time--especially since we do so much business w/ENA & Aquila and the Master 
is so old).

Please confirm the above for me and let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks and I apologize for the delay in getting back to you,

Veronica

Please see below,  re MAC for Aquila

Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere
Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our "approved" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the "bandwidth" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!

Debra Perlingiere

Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we 
currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?

In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:

We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming 
party.

Section 13.5  NY law is fine.

Our netting language is a stated below:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is 
not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in 
the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to 
one year.

Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak 
to someone in your office for credit information.

Best regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Further to our conversation,  please see attached Sample of our Master 
Agreement and GISB.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call to discuss any issues and  or 
concerns you may have regarding this matter.

Sandra,

In response to your comments:

Section 11.1    We  cannot agree to the use of GISB's force majeure language.
Section 13.9  We will agree to suggested changes.

Finally,  warranty language would also need to be included in the GISB.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

not be neutral" to "designate a neutral arbitrator".

Section 8.5 is added as a new section under Section 8 -Title, Warranty and
Indemnity, as follows:

   "8.5   (i)   Intrastate Warranted Gas.  If the Delivery Point(s) for the
   Transaction  are  intrastate interconnections, (a) Seller represents and
   warrants  to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced within the State
   of  Texas  and  will  not  have been commingled by Seller with other Gas
   prior  to  the  Delivery  Point(s)  which  is  or may be sold, consumed,
   transported  or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in such manner
   which  would  subject Buyer's Transporter's pipeline to the jurisdiction
   of  the  Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission or an successor authority
   under  the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and (b) Buyer represents and warrants
   to  Seller  that  none of the Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or
   otherwise  utilized  outside  the State of Texas or delivered to another
   party  which will subsequently sell, consume, transport or otherwise use
   the  Gas  outside  the  State  of  Texas  where such event would subject
   Buyer's  Transporter's  pipeline,  Seller's  pipeline, or any portion of
   such  pipelines  to  the  jurisdiction  of the Federal Energy Regulatory
   Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.

Debra,

Since we currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities, we can do an
"identical" one with PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.  Draw it up in duplicate and mail it
out to me (I'm attaching a "Notices" sheet for you to use in preparing it).
Your Credit Department can contact our Alan A. Babp, Credit Risk Analyst, at
Phone: 610-774-6129 or email: aababp@pplweb.com.  OR they can go directly to
our web site (www.pplweb.com) and click on "Building Shareowner Value", which
will take them to our financial information page.

Debra, we also prefer to be the confirming party, but have become enamored of
"Both" since it forces our Trading Controls to compare our Confirmation
document with your Confirmation document. As a matter of interest, the 
existing
GISB we have with you, dated June 1, 1999, does in fact have "Both" parties
listed as confirming parties and your office prepared that document.

Your netting language is acceptable.

You and I know that the disclaimer states that the GISB is intended for
Interruptible transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and that
it does apply to the Enron contract.  However, we have 141 other contracts 
that
are used for Firm transactions of up to one year (which is the maximum
allowable period the Fuel Trading group can commit to without higher, Vice
Presidential, approval and signature.  So, if we have the time period
specified, as I suggested, in the Special Provisions we have a much better
chance that our Traders will remember which contract to use, our data entry
personnel will cite the proper contract and, if not, our Trading Controls
personnel will spot and correct any that sneak by. So if it is just a
matter of resistance to duplication, I ask that you "bite the bullet" for I
would appreciate it if we could have the language included.

Thanks for your response.

Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we
currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?

In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:

We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the
confirming party.

Section 13.5  NY law is fine.

Our netting language is a stated below:

In  the  event  that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in
the  same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may
be  aggregated  and  the  Parties  may  discharge  their obligations to pay
through  netting,  in  which  case  the  Party,  if  any, owing the greater
aggregate  amount  may  pay  to  the other Party the difference between the
amounts owed.

Your  suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is
not  necessary  as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page
in   the   disclaimer.   With  regards  to  limitation,  we  do  not  limit
transactions to one year.

(See attached file: Sam3102.doc)

Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to
speak to someone in your office for credit information.

Best regards,

Debra,

As requested  here is a bit of history regarding the initial request for the
above referenced Agreement.

On July 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 Cabot began purchasing supply from
Enron at Sumas.  When we received the Transaction Agreement dated June 10,
1999, I began calling regarding the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement
dated November 1, 1993, stated therein.   I could find no such agreement in
our files.

On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized that
Enron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in its
merger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 1994.  I tried on
several occasions to explain the situation.  Finally on October 24, 2000 we
received the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1,
2000.  We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompass
the original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions.

See the attached sheet for specific deal information.
 <<GC115.xls>>
Hope this helps.  I have submitted the master agreement for execution and
will let you know when it is on its way.  Thanks.

Laurie

Concerning the status of Cinnabar, Mr. Shumway and I are currently discussing 
requested changes in the Guaranty involving letters of credit and damages.    
We cannot agree to their suggested change in language to the Guaranty.  
Therefore as some of their transactions are for 30-60 days and they are 
looking at on line trading,  I purposed for the short term a GISB.  He 
agreed, and I will be sending our draft of same to him for review (I will 
include you in my e-mail).   The issue of the Master is still open and I 
await his final response.

I will keep you informed of Cinnabar's status.

Debra,  I have reviewed Markwest's proposed changes to the Master, and given 
the fact that we have since amended the ISDA with Markwest I would like to 
maintain consistency between the two agreements with respect to the credit 
terms.  This being said, I have attached an amended credit worksheet that 
highlights in Red the changes I would like inserted in the Master.  Please 
make these changes.  You will notice that I have increased Markwest's 
collateral threshold to $1MM and have agreed to both of their proposals to 
amend the Third Party Debt and the Collateral Multiple amount.  Also, with 
respect to their request to amend Section 4.2, section (ix), I would like to 
know how they define 'borrowed money' and if this change is going to be 
representative of Markwest, then why is it not bi-lateral.

Thanks

Debra,

Ok, we're getting there.  Please see comments below.

1. Good, please prepare the draft Master Agreement and send it to my 
attention.
 We've been doing business with Enron since 1996, so the credit review
shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably find everything you need on our home
page (www.pplweb.com) or call Alan Babp at (610) 774-6129 { 
aababp@pplweb.com}.

2. We're at a stalemate on the confirmations.  I have checked with out
electrical side and their negotiated contract with Enron uses "Seller
Confirms".  For Gas GISB contracts while we prefer "PPL Confirms", we 
recognize
that almost everyone wants to be the confirming party so we have been 
accepting
"Both".  But if you can't accept either of them, I suppose we can live with
"Seller Confirms", since our electrical side has accepted it.  Those are our
choices, in order of preference.

3. Good, I'm pleased you agree to the "redundant" language.  I know it will
help my Trading Controls people.

Please advise...again, I think we're close.
Gary  Shay

Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an 
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each 
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to 
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater 
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the 
amounts owed.

delivery may not take place until the 5th?  In any case, should we not reach 
agreement today, I will have the confirm desk send a confirm with GTC and 
move the transaction to the finalized Master upon completion.
 
I will let you know by 5:00 today our status.

Hi Debra,

Have you had any word back from credit regarding the Exposure Thresholds?
When last we spoke, Enron wanted Duke to be reduced to $1M regarding Early
Termination Damages due to current exposure rates.  Our credit department
came back and said the Enron's exposure to Duke was such that they would
then want to see an equal reduction in Enron's Early Termination Damges
amount.

Basically, our credit department has asked that these amounts be reciprocal
in nature as we have a situation where our exposure to one another is
almost equal.

Please let me know what they say.

Robin

Robin,

Thanks for your e-mail,  I have sent another request along with your comments 
to our credit department.  I hope to have a response this week.

Sounds like yours really had it bad.  Mine may not have had a virus though.
It may just have been coincidental.  I hope that Tizzer and Geronimo are

You were thanking me too soon for the info on the confirm.
I gave you the wrong information. (Alan Koelemay just called me.  I told him 
that it was my fault and we'll be sending him a new one.)

The price should be:
Inside FERC CIG Index minus $.67 not Gas Daily minus $.55 (that was the 
purchase prices from April.  Which is the month I'm working on for 
allocations right now.  (Not that this falls as a valid excuse)).  All other 
information is fine.

Alan is throwing away the confirm you sent and is waiting for a new one.

Further to our conversation below is suggested language for Section 8.2.

8.2. Transfer.  This Agreement, including, without limitation, each 
indemnification, shall inure to and bind the permitted successors and assigns 
of the Parties; provided, neither Party shall transfer this Agreement without 
the prior written approval of the other Party which may be withheld entirely 
at the option of such Party; provided further, either Party may, without the 
consent of the other Party (and without relieving itself from liability 
hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement or 
the accounts, revenues or proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or 
other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any 
Affiliate by assignment, merger or otherwise, or (iii) transfer or assign 
this Agreement to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all 
of the assets of such Party.  Any Party's transfer in violation of this 
Section 8.2 shall be void.
Finally, with regards to Section 4.2, we will agree to the use of 
"occurrence" in  (vii) however,  we will not agree to the "borrowed money" in 
section (ix).

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Pat,

Attached is a draft of the GISB between ENA and Sequent Energy.   As 
requested,  I have included in the Special Provisions found on the last page, 
an addition to Section 7 a provision for netting.   

Regarding the date,  how were the previous transactions papered you wish to 
be a part of this GISB?  Are there in current active transactions?

Finally, if in agreement with this draft please complete Sequent's 
administrative portion and remove "Draft" from the heading and we can discuss 
your reasons for the date change.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

I know that you forwarded to me a copy of an agreement initially between ENA
and BNG (the CES predecessor) but unfortunately, all of our files are in
boxes (just moved office areas)so I can not locate immediately.  If you want
to, we can re-generate a copy for ENA with the applicable terms of the
referenced agreement (title of the agreement and effective date is all I
need), and forward to you.

Let me know if you can help me with this new request ----then we can take
care of it right away.

Now it is my turn to apologize for a late response.  Having said that, I have 
reviewed your remarks regarding the GISB my comments are as  follows:

Section 1.2   Transactions may be negotiated orally or online.  In either 
case Enron will  send a written confirmation via fax or electronic for  the 
trade.  I hope this helps in clearing any confusion regarding the oral 
designation in Section1.2.

Section 7.2 With regards ACH, I am waiting on a response from my accounting 
dept.

Section 13.5 Concerning jurisdiction we will agree to  New York.

Please let me have your thoughts regards these issues.

Judy,

Further to our conversation,  attached is a draft of a Master Agreement for 
TransCanada Energy Marketing.  I anticipate sending a draft of the Master 
Agreement for TransCanada Gas Services Inc. late today or early tomorrow. 

 Also as you may recall, with regards to the guaranties, I have left Section 
4.5 in the draft however, the exhibits noted are not attached to this 
document.  

I look forward to working with you in completing these agreements.    

Regards, 
Debra Perlingiere

I wanted to let  you know I am currently negotiating two Master Gas 
Agreements with TransCanada for the two entities listed above.  As previously 
discussed, credit suggests increasing  TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s  guaranty 
to $50MM and decreasing Enron's to the same amount.    Have you discussed 
TransCanada's guaranty?    Is $50MM large enough to cover your agreement? 

Veronica Espinoza(66002) in credit is working with me on guaranty issues.   
Finally, did you receive copies of Enron's and TransCanads's guaranty?  If  
not, let me know I will fax same.  Their guaranty expires the end of this 
month. 

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Here is the draft for TransCanada Gas Services Inc.

FYI,
In reference to your memo of May 5th,  I prepared and sent a new Master to 
Pan on May 1st.  Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at 
Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker 
(713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one 
in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new 
agreement when he had time.

Debra Perlingiere

The company is Marine Exchange   713-678-7711.  When you call tell them to 
place you on their  watch list w/ 24 hours notice.   

Debra Perlingiere

Please give me an update or status for the following:

Dynegy Canada Inc. When we last spoke, you were in the review process and 
wanted to make changes to credit terms. Please advise on how I should proceed.

Engage Energy Canada LP The draft went to Engage in Oct. of last year.  You 
had said you wanted to change credit terms?   Do you want me to keep trying 
with this draft or send a new one?

TransAlta Energy marketing Corp. Do you want to change the credit terms ?

Reliant energy Services Canada Ltd. They have requested a Master with HPL?

Please let me have your thoughts on each of these  by early tomorrow as I 
have to give Jeff / Stacy a memo regarding  progress.  If was my 
understanding from my last conversation with Veronica that there is 
significant exposure with some of these.  

Many thanks!

CES.   Regarding those agreements, we have Consent Agreements for assignment 
from MarkWest.

Concerning the Master Sale Spot Agreement dated 5-1-90,  I have located same 
and will send you a fax of it as well.

I agree, with your suggestion to terminate the previous agreements and we can 
begin with a new GISB.   I have not yet determined , do you know if there are 
any trades booked under any of these contracts?   If so, we can move them to 
the new agreement,

Section 2.24 Gas Daily --Midpoint

Section 13.5 We will agree to Texas or New York  jurisdictions.

Special Provisions

Section 1.2, Oral Transaction Procedure:

In third line of  the suggested paragraph, delete  "for purposes of Section 
2.201(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code".

Section 7.5

We suggest the following language:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with you questions or comments.

ownership and name change.   Curt  indicated they would be able to provide a 
LC.   I told him he and or his credit dept. would need to discuss these

Debra,

Per the info below, can you please review the information and see if you can 
find any information as to why we can't use the Committed Reserves contract 
mentioned.  I'd also like to terminate the two GTC contracts listed as 
well.   Client Services needs to clear up this issue very soon and I'd like 
Legal to sign off on the terminations.

Please don't hesistate to call me at x30569 or Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan at 
x31443 if you have any questions or need further information.   Thanks!

	
	                           
	

Tricia,

I've uncovered some troubling information regarding the issue with Hall 
Energy Company and Willis Enterprises Corp. based on the info you sent me.  
Apparently, at one time, Enron was assigned a Committed Reserves contract 
with Hall Energy Company (Global #96003960) originally signed 05/07/84, 
effective with first production 10/04/84, that is still effective.  Two deals 
were entered in Sitara under this contract, covering 02/98 and 04/98 
production.  From 05/98 production on, deals were tied to a GTC Purchase Spot 
contract (Global #96014936).  

I'm not sure why the GTC was set up when we had a purchase contract already 
in place; it appears that this GTC covers the same well (Stewart #1) that the 
Committed Reserves contract covers.  Not only that, but a point was set up 
under the GTC (we don't set up points under GTCs, only under Committed 
Reserves).  It was the same point under the Committed Reserves contract.  
Also, later deals entered in Sitara even include this exact meter used for 
the GTC.

You also included documentation from Hall authorizing payments to Willis.  
I've reviewed all contract and correspondence files for this contract and can 
find absolutely NO documentation showing that Willis in an interest owner in 
this well.  Do you have any division orders or other assignments showing that 
Willis has an interest in the Stewart #1?  If that's the case, I can add 
Willis as a seller under the Committed Reserves and we can have all deals 
moved to the original contract.  However, Willis still will not receive a 
separate payment.  Enron will only issue payment to the counterparty on the 
contract (the operator) so Willis will have to receive payment from Hall.

A GTC Purchase Spot contract (Global #96007659) was also set up for Willis 
Enterprises Corp.  That could technically have been for separate purchases, 
but more recent deals in Sitara show that these purchases were from the same 
meter point for the Stewart #1 that the GTC for Hall used.  I can find no 
documentation on either of the Hall or Willis GTCs to reflect that these were 
set up to handle different wells than the one in question.  Without any other 
paper, it is my guess that both the Hall GTC (96014936) and the Willis GTC 
(96007659) were set up in error.  The people responsible for setting up the 
contracts are no longer around and would probably not remember anything if 
they were.  I would like to run this by Legal, but my inclination is to 
cancel both GTCs and settle under the Committed Reserves contract set up 
originally for Hall.  I will forward this information to Legal to see how to 
proceed.

I know all this is confusing, but please let me know if you have any 
additional documentation from Willis or if you have any questions.  I will 
turn this matter over to Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan (who handles the "H" 
counterparties) and she will let you know the outcome.  Of course, you can 
always call me with questions, but this is really her domain since the 
contract in question is with Hall.

Thanks,
Stacey  x30569

You will do fine on the exam.  Do not worry!!!!   
No, the new garage is still under construction.
Yes, you were spoiled !  Glad to know California is still full of fruits and 
nuts and the women are inferior to TEXAS women.   
  
Take care!  

Debra Perlingiere

Where are we with this customer?  Have they refused to increase their 
guaranty? Please advise.

Thanks~!

Debra Perlingiere

I will be leaving at 1:30 PM tomorrow for a doctors appointment, and return 
if time permits.

Debra Perlingiere

Thanks for your e-mail.  I feel like our accounting dept. or contract 
administration has somehow billed incorrectly.   I have spoke to the attorney 
I will be in touch, and hope to have this resolved on Monday.   Thanks for 
your assistance.

Debra Perlingiere

I have prepared a master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement for Enron LNG.  Can you 
provide me with the name of person at Enron LNG I should direct this to?

Thanks for you help.

agreement to.

Thanks for your help.

Debra Perlingiere

Paramy,

I did receive your e-mails and apologize for my late response.  Yes, I will 
be the negotiating person for the agreement with the exception of credit 
terms and issues, but will also be involved in the background with credit.  

I hope to  e-mail you my comments by the end of next week.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Thanks for the Happy Birthday!   You know at this age you do not want any

I have completed my review of  International Paper's Natural Gas Sales and 
Purchase Agreement as requested.  As constructed, there are numerous 
revisions that would need to be made for this agreement to be acceptable.  

Having said that, are you aware we currently have in place a Master Sale Firm 
Agreement  with IP dated May 5, 1995?   

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Debra Perlingiere

Would you send me another fax of the agreement at issue?  I have sent the 
previous fax to our contract administration and billing departments.  

Thanks,

Debra Perlingiere

Thank you, I have received your fax and directed it to our contract 
Best Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

I have sent you via, our clerk a copy of the GTC.  Please let me know if it 
does not reach you.

Debra,

I'm not sure we wouldn't prefer to have it kept as Houston Pipe Line
Company.  We have been filing with the regulatory bodies all expenses under
HPL, since November of '99.  So, what I would like to have happen, even if
it was a mistake, is have the contract assigned to HPL.  This will keep our
records with the PUCT and FERC the same.  In either case, I will still need
documentation in our contract files to show the assignment.  I appreciate
your help, and please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.

Dana K. Lewis
Supervisor, Gas Contract Administration

I would like to take the following vacation days:

Friday July 14th

Monday July 31st ---Monday August 7th.

Debra Perlingiere

The Guaranty is specific to the master.  In paragraph  #1 it says 
"...guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract....".   Also at 
the top of the agreement it says "...entering into and Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date...."  

DP

We cannot assign this agreement to HPL.  Although the billing was in error, 
We are sorry for any inconvenience.  Please let me know if I can be of 
further assistance.  

Debra Perlingiere

I took 1 hour for Dr.'s appt. on July 7th.   All other time is same.

Debra Perlingiere

Enjoy!

Dear Debra,

It is great to hear from you.  I just took a practice
exam.  I consisted of 3 essays from 9-12, then a one
hour lunch break, then a 3 hour performance test.  I
think I did well on the essays, but not the
performance exam.    I pretty much spend most of my
time sudying.  this whole bar thing is quite an
undertaking.  I do not know how people pass it, but
they do.  It is a lot of work and sometimes you just
hit these walls, but I have rebounded prety quick.

BErkely is quite an interresting place.  I have seen
more Freaks here than in Austin during college easily.
 It is like they bread them here.  At first, it was
funny and I liked it, but now it has become so normal
for me to see a guy with a nose ring, and a tattoo
over his adam apple(Ouch!), that they are just another
person.  I have met some people, but I do not hand out
with people here very much.  I knew that coming here,
but at times it does get lonely.

The women here are quite average.  I think I was very
spoiled in Texas.  Texas women are beautiful.

I am house sitting for my uncle in San Francisco for
the 4th of July weekend.  So it is a nice break from
bar reviewing, bt I did bring all my books.

I still think of you guys a lot.  Please tell everyone
that I say hello.

So has the new parking garage been built yet ot what.

Take care....Yaron Shaham

Finally, because I know you would want to know, I do
not have a BOYfriend, yet there was this one guy I
met, oops, uh nevermind.

I am sure he thinks he is!

Debra Perlingiere

So does this included the guys?   There is just so much to do in LJ!  Dinner/

Debra Perlingiere

I will be out of the office Friday July 14th.

Debra Perlingiere

Yes, I have heard about the changes in your life.  I  will make some inquires 
and get back with you.      Did you look at Enron.com in the job bank?   My 
CD player has cost the price of a VERY good bottle of something to have 2 
extracted!  NOT my fault.  It is working only as a single player, the changer 
cannot be trusted.

  
Have a great weekend,  I  will be in touch!

Debra Perlingiere

As discussed, please see attached.

Debra Perlingiere

I have discussed the GISB, and sent them our version.

Debra Perlingiere

Rob,

I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
Service on 3/29.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

are resolved. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any additional questions 
or comments.

Debra Perlingiere

A couple of things I wanted to tell you.

 1.  There is a company in Houston named "Compsys".  I have been told they 
are the contract agency who places computer staff here.  Which is a good way 
to get in. Sorry, I do not have their number.

2.   In addition to searching enron.com, also search enron.net, this is our 
broadband network.

Debra Perlingiere

Please see below.

Debra Perlingiere

I will be happy to provide you with comments however, an agreement cannot be 
put in place until credit issues are resolved.   If you would like to discuss 
credit terms and letter of credit  please contact Russell Diamond with our

Debra -- The delay from my side was due to a change in the approach where the 
LNG people now do not want to use an offshore company.  Therefore we should 
use the following as the counterparty:

Enron LNG Marketing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

The address would be the Three Allen Center address on Clay St., 18th floor.

	Office: Save As... responds very slowly when naming the file
Mike Hernandez on 06/12 at 10:04 AM
Category: Applications 

Problem: When a document is created or renamed using the Save As option under 
the File menu, the system responds very slowly when typing in a file name.

Cause: Office keeps a directory full of shortcuts to recently opened files.  
As this directory gets larger, the problem starts to occur.

Resolution: Delete the h:\application data\microsoft\office\recent 
directory.  It will be re-created when the next file is saved.  Note: This is 
a workaround, as this directory will re-populate itself over time and the 
problem will resurface.  A long-term solution is being researched.

Please place on your calender my vacation days beginning July 31st through 
August 7th.

Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere

Idacorp is faxing me a $10m guarantee from Enron to them with an expiration 
date of 9/00.  In order for us to receive the $5m guarantee from Idacorp Inc.

Did you get an answer to your question?

Debra Perlingiere

I am putting a Master Agreement together for a customer that will agree only 
to New York law.  Do you have a problem with changing the jurisdiction in 
Enron Corp.'s guaranty (item #8, second page of the Enfolio Master)  to New 
York law?

Debra Perlingiere

Thanks so much.  I will see you Fri. for sure, and I can come by an get the 
books Sat.    I am so glad to get these books.   Regarding the symphony,  I

Welcome back from your vacation.

We've got our GISB agreement in place, and gas is flowing.   However,
Metromedia Energy is still waiting on a Master Agreement so we can do some
term deals.  We've got the form of parent guaranty, and that's been
approved, so once we can fill in the dollar figure we'll have that taken
care of.

I have not yet seen a sample master agreement, so if you can email that to
me, it would speed things up a bit.

Thanks

In preparing for our meeting with Exxon, I have hit a dead end with regards 
to the "Agreement"  he cites in his fax to us.  I have searched and others as 
well to no avail.    Therefore,  would you ask Jacobson to fax  you/me  the 
entire agreement he is referring too because it does not exist in our world.  

Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere

Please  send your "OK" to Janette for a lap top.

Thanks!

Janette your suggestion for the "M-700" is my choice.

Thank you !

In a conversation with Randy Miller of Texla, the following credit issues 
were raised:

1.  Texla would like to raise their threshold to $200,000;
2.   In place of a LC  Texla would offer furture trades  within 24 hours.

As previously discussed, I can write the language, the decision is a credit  
call.

Debra Perlingiere

Do you know if we received a GISB for Exxon and CES? If so, what is the name 
on the agreement for Exxon?

Thanks!

need.  Please advise.

H.L. Jacobson
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company

Further to our discussion Friday, concerning certain confirmations for 
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company, I have determined the following: first, 
ExxonMobil  or HPL may confirm transactions as agreed at the time of the 
trade; second, in the event HPL confirms,  we have made changes to our system 
which should prevent the  issuance of  GTCs for Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing 
Company trades, with the exception of "online" trades, therefore causing  
future trades relating to these agreements to attach to one of two contracts 
under discussion  Friday.   Please bear in mind these changes may not be in 
effect until the end of next week.  With regards to confidentiality language 
contained in the confirm, we are unable to amend this at this time.

Finally, concerning the August 8th letter (confirmation) provided by you in 
the meeting, we are in agreement with same.

We trust the foregoing meets with your approval.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact me with any questions you may have regarding this matter.

Regards,

me some much need coaching  in a few areas.  As for the  "J" men,  well I 
think you have the better deal as I think mine as taken off.  Sorry to hear 
about Jason.  Would like to come for a visit, or meet you somewhere, say 
Santa Fe,  when time permits.

"Customer".  Deleted "[or its Guarantor] J.M. does not have a guarantor.

On the signature page for the Guaranty I changed "JM Huber" to  "J.W. Huber".

In addition, in the "Appendix "1" I have deleted "EBITDA Coverage Ratio"
this ratio does not apply here.   And moved "Net Income" to its correct place 
in alpha order before "Net Worth"

We can amend, and assign everything including the guaranties, as long as I

Debra,

Craig Taylor  would like to have a GISB executed with Houston Energy Services 
Company LLC.  The contact there is Carol Wood 713-463-5040.  They are not set 
up in the system yet; I'm working on that at the moment.  All I have on them 
thus far is a D&B report.

Their address is 10497 Town & Country Way, #150  Houston, TX  77024.

If you need any other info, give me a call and I'll try to get it for you.

Thanks,

Veronica

Please see the attached Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.

We are in receipt of signed faxes of the Transaction Agreement and Master 
Agreement however,  we also need signed originals.  To that end,  "DRAFT" has 
been removed from the attached documents for execution.  Please note, on the 
first page of the Master Agreement  and Exhibit "C"  the blank  after "a".  
Determine  the state of  incorporation for Huber, and file in the name of the 
state.

Finally,  print two of each document,  have signed and send both to my 
attention. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.   

      
Debra Perlingiere

Do you know the name of a contact I can send the draft at this company?

Thanks!

THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Debra Perlingiere

I will send you the info.  After I prepare the confirms, I want you to take a 
look at them before they go.  When is a good time for me to  come down this 
afternoon?

Debra Perlingiere

Due to computer troubles etc.  I did not get the confirms or agreement out 
last night.  I assure you it is going today via Fed Ex First Delivery.  Is 
the previous address still the location you want these docs sent too?

Debra Perlingiere

can you do dinner/or show Sunday afternoon?

Debra Perlingiere

Would you have any free time if I came to New Mexico?  I know it is close to 
impossible to get a room during the balloon thing?  

Debra Perlingiere

Are you interested in doing dinner / or show Sunday afternnoon / evening?

Debra Perlingiere

Sorry it took so long.  Here is the draft of the Master Agreement.

Debra Perlingiere

What dates will you be there? Where are you staying?

Debra Perlingiere

Sorry for responding so late, as suggest before, Enron prefers to use 
different paper.  We could put a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place 
and a GISB for short term.

Debra Perlingiere

I am a legal assistant for Jeff Hodge.  At his suggestion,  I am contacting 
you concerning the possibility of spending time with you or a trader in your 
area observing "the business"  during bid week if possible, in order that I 
may gain experience and information concerning gas trading.  A few hours in 
the morning or whenever is best for you.  

Thanks for your help!

Debra Perlingiere

Venona, 

I have discussed the warranty issue with my attorney and he suggested the 
following be used as Section 8.5.  The language in this section allows for 
gas from outside the state.  Please advise.

The following representations and warranties shall apply to Transactions 
under the stated conditions:  (i) if Company is Buyer, Seller represents and 
warrants to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced (a) within the state 
of Texas and will not have been commingled with other Gas which is or may be 
sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in 
such manner which would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction 
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under 
the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (b) outside of the state of Texas with any 
transportation on an interstate pipeline having been conducted under Section 
311 (a)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and (ii) if Company is Seller and 
the Delivery Point(s) for the Transaction are not interstate 
interconnections, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that none of the 
Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized outside the 
state or sold to another party which will subsequently sell, consume, 
transport or otherwise use the Gas outside the State where such event would 
subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of 
1938.

Please forgive my slow response.  We don't have a problem with the
confirmation itself.  It was the general terms and conditions that we didn't
want to agree to without review.  It would be best to execute a master gas
agreement that would accommodate longer term deals.  Attached is our Master
Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement.

In response to your memo, concerning Article 11,   I have increased El Paso's 
threshold to $10,000,000; Article 17.13 "further acts" and "deeds"  means any 
further action that would need to be taken by either or both parties shall be 
done, i.e. new taxes or tariffs etc.  This article gives assurances to both 
parties that each will honor the necessary changes as required in the course 
of normal business.  In addition, I  have changed the date to October 1, 2000.

If this is satisfactory, I will send execution documents for signing. 

Please review the attached, and let me know.

Buyer - ENA
Seller - Questa Petroleum Company 

1,588 MMBtu per day at Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. for October 01, 2000 
through October 31, 2000.
Price is equal to US Dollars $3.15710 per MMBtu.
Interruptible Gas
Contract - Master Purch Wellhead

This deal was originally confirmed as an Oct-Dec delivery of firm gas....on a 
GTC-Firm...so revised language might want to be included in your confirm(??)

Also, there are only two active trades with Oasis Pipeline Company which are 
October Transportation deals...and I don't confirm.

Please let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks
Jennifer
5-7678

In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the 
GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the 
midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific 
pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into 
place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  

Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader 
and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Dp

Which state is North Canton located in?

Debra Perlingiere

I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your 
provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last 
sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these 
recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are 
founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a 
provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these 
recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.

Cary,

Thanks for your e-mail.   Your suggestion to rephrase the second sentence of 
number 6 is acceptable with one change.  Could we change "may be used" to 
"shall be used" in the sentence beginning with "Each".

Finally, my attorney insists  Enron be the confirming party in Section 2.5. 

Pending these changes, we are ready to finalize.

Hello Debra:

Regarding your comments to Jeff Mayer of MxEnergy:

I spoke directly with Veronica and she never asked that the GISB be
co-signed.  Aquila will not co-sign GISB's.  Further, Veronica told me that
she would accept a guarantee from Aquila.  She had the format of the
guarantee in hand at the time we had the discussion.  Please contact me if
you have any further questions on this matter.  My number is 203-356-1318.

Thank you for your help in this matter.  We appreciate it and look forward to
expanding our relationship with Enron.

I sent the following to MR. Somers on 4/12.  Sorry  an oversight and 
neglected to cc you on the e-mail.

Rob,

I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
Service on 3/29.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kathleen,

Further to our conversation, attached are drafts for Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreements for HPL and ENA.  As previously noted, our credit 
department has been in discussions with Jennifer West and Aquila's credit 
department regarding these agreements.  It is my understanding Aquila  
requested the attached drafts.

Having said that, I will review your responses to my comments for the HPL 
agreement.  I  have suggested  we amend the current Master Agreement (1993) 
between ENA and Aquila. 

Finally, while there are existing guaranties currently in place between Enron 
and Aquila, they are only referenced in the attached  and not included.   

I  look forward to working with you in finalizing  these agreements.  Please 
let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

       
Best regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Hi Sylvia,

Re the GISB for Wisconsin,  no we would not agree to the terms of their GISB 
on the front page or their special provisions.   Are you aware we currently 
have a GISB in place with Wisconsin Public Service Company and ENA as well as 
with Wisconsin Gas Company??????

Re Master Status:  I have devoted  my afternoon to this contract  in order to 
complete the redline.  Will keep you apprised.

Do you still want a copy of our GISB.  If so, I will send you a draft 
however,  I need to fill in the name  of the counterparty etc. before it goes 
out.

Very truly yours,
Debra Perlingiere

Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with 
much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer.  
There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron 
Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and 
will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most 
unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.   

Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or 
comments about ProLiance.  

Debra Perlingiere

As requested, please see the attached GISB draft for your review.

Nancy,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral 
Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a 
"writing" and to have been "signed".  For all transactions under the GISB, a 
written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  "Oral" 
on the first page.   

I am checking on the status of the term deal. 

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

Carl, 

Thank you for your e-mail.  Concerning Section 13.5, we will agree to New 
York on choice of law.  For Section 2.5, ENA as confirming party.  Finally, 
Section 3.2  we prefer Spot Price as this is a short term deal.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.

Best regards,
Debra Perlingiere

The only paper we have with Superior Water is a Master Sale Spot contract.  I

from Turkey Day vacation.  The dogs are good.  I packed them up and drove 9 
hours to Ark to visit the folks.  Geronimo was very good.  I was surprised, 
although he was a little much for my Dad.   

How is the baby?  Have you adjusted?  Have the dogs adjusted?  

The luncheon was just OK.  I thought last year was better with regards to 
food and clothes.  River Oaks CC did not live up to the Junior League in my 
opinion.

Debra Perlingiere

Jeff Hodge requested that I forward the following collateral language for 
your review. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

[4.6.] Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold.  If at any time 
and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding 
whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would 
be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should 
exceed $______, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other 
Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal 
to the Termination Payment in excess of $______ (rounding upwards for any 
fractional amount to the next $______), or such other collateral as may be 
reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.  The Letter of Credit or 
other collateral shall be delivered within two Business Days of the date of 
such notice.  On a Monthly basis, such Letter of Credit may be increased or 
reduced correspondingly to the amount of such excess Termination Payment 
(rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $______).  For 
purposes of this Section [4.6], the calculation of "Termination Payment" 
shall include all amounts owed but not yet paid by one Party to the other 
Party whether or not such amounts are then due, for performance already 
provided pursuant to any and all Transactions.

Debra Perlingiere

The above reference deal number (#87541) needs to be split due to 
counterparty name change and credit/legal (contract) changes that also need 
to be made. Effective 5/1/00, Industrial Energy Applications, Inc. changed 
its name on the deal to Heartland Energy Group, Inc. and a new contract was 
negotiated. As such, production for 5/1/00 - 5/31/04 needs to be split and 
moved under HEARTLAND ENERGY GROUP, INC. I will be faxing you a copy of the 
new (manually produced) confirmation.

Please notify me once the split has occurred as there is a guarantee 
associated with this transaction in addition to a new master contract.

Thank you!

James,

Further to our conversation, please see the attached GISB draft for your 
review.   I understand this will be for short term deals (30 days or less) 
and delivery in the United States.

Debra Perlingiere

Glad to hear the dogs are ok.  But  I knew they would be, its you that has to 
make the real adjustment.    I took Ellen Wallumrod, (she is new on the 
confirm desk),  Allison McHenry / Marianne Castano (from EES I gave my 
invitation to them) and Genia.    I had trouble trying to find someone who 
wanted to go. 

Take care, enjoy being away.

Thanks  for your e-mail regarding a master with Reliant Energy Services 
Canada, Ltd.  ENA has a Canadian form of contract we could work with which 
will have most of your changes already contained.  If we use the U.S. master 
there are problems with provisions regarding taxes, arbitration etc.  so I 
would like to suggest we use the Canadian form with your changes as needed.  
Please let me have your thoughts.

Debra:

I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel
are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms.
Medcalf.  They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested
changes.  I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my
change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment
dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other
Resale Customers.

I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format
requirement of the Buyer?

Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move
forward. I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my
progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Is this a yearly contract or month to month? Do you want 30 day notice  or 60 day for year contract?

If you would, please send the confirm.  

Two additions:

1.  I think that the language for the pricing should include "less applaicable gathering and processing fees incurred by the Buyer, including those fees charged by Gatherco, Inc.".

2.  The Pipeline for Mtr 717457 is Gatherco, Inc.

ps - can you confirm drafts for Mountaineer Gas, Giant Industries, Inc., and El Paso Electric Company went out.  

 << File: CIMA Energy LLC1.xls >> 

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a "Spot Market" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

3.5. Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Thanks for your email.  The Assignment looks fine.  Regarding Exhibits "C" and "D", I have copies of executed parental guaranties  for both parties and will fax same to you.

 Many thanks for your help. Have a great weekend.

Debra:

Attached for your consideration is a "red-lined" revised  draft of the Assignment Agreement reflecting our discussion earlier today.
Please let me know if the form of the Agreement as revised is acceptable.

Additionally, I have completed a review of the master agreement that you provided earlier today.  I do not anticipate that Nicor Energy will have many proposed revisions, but have yet to have an opportunity to discuss the agreement with my client.  Although Exhibit "C" and "D" were not attached to the master agreement that you provided, it is my understanding that Enron and Nicor Energy have already agreed to the terms of the parental guaranties associated with this Agreement.

Thanks

   On Saturday, Sept. 22, 2001 at approximately 1:47 a.m., I was awaken by
   the sounds of a car crash.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my
   bedroom window at Hwy 36, I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell
   asleep.  At approximately 2:45 a.m., I was awaken by the sounds of a man
   outside my bedroom window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up
   pretty bad.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window, I
   saw a police officer outside with a flash light.  I woke Keith up to
   tell him the police were in our yard.  Keith dressed and went out the
   front door.  The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed
   suspect was running around our home.  Keith came back inside and told me
   what was going on.  After checking on Andrew, we went into Chasity's
   vacant bedroom and looked out the window into the backyard.  Men with
   flash lights, police cars with spot lights were all over our yard.
   Finally, the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree closes to our
   house.  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to
   surrender.  Since the suspect would not cooperate, an officer shouted
   several times that he was going to "shoot".  This was not something I
   wanted to witness, so I quit looking out the window.  Keith told me that
   he surrendered and that they had him in custody.  An officer starting
   knocking on our front door.  As I opened the door, I informed the
   officer that my husband would be right there.  Keith went outside to
   talk to the officer.  I looked out my living room window and saw my
   driveway full of police cars followed by an ambulance.  Hwy 36 and
   Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed
   toward our house.  Keith came inside and informed me that Buccee's in
   Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted, the
   ambulance was for her and the suspect didn't have a gun, but was
   carrying a knife.  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that
   the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side
   of our barn.  The police were outside video taping our front yard,
   treating it as a crime scene.  Once the police took off with the suspect
   and the ambulance transported the victim, Keith talked me into going
   outside and looking at the crash.  By this time, a wrecker was at the
   scene.  We watched the wrecker driver pull the truck back onto all four
   tires and haul it away.

   On Sunday morning at approximately 2:30 a.m., I woke up and started
   listening for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier.
   Once I realized that my home was safe, I went back to sleep.

   With a troubled mind, I realized that I did not know how to deal with
   "violence". I called my brother-in-law, Rev. Dale Frankum, for answers.
   Dale suggested I read the book of Psalm.  Gladys suggested particularly
   Chapter 91.  After reading Psalm 91:4 "He will cover you with his
   feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness
   will be your shield and rampart", I found peace of mind.  I now know
   that He put me back to bed, instead of me searching for an answer to the
   crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home.  And He
   kept my son in a deep sleep so that Andrew would not witness the horror
   that was going on right outside his bedroom window.  At this time, all
   Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in our front yard, I would like
   to spare him from the rest of the story.

   As our country heals from the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and as we
   continue to fear more terrorist attacks, I suggest you read the book of
   Psalm to find peace of mind because He is our refuge.

   My God Bless you, your family and America.

Debra,
Do you mind if we make the effective date December 1, 2001?  We've done quite a
few deals under this contract in October and I don't want to have to process new
confirms for this past business.  Additionally, by the time we route the
amendment through our organization, get it signed and back to you, and then
Enron does the same thing, we could be looking at the same problem in November.
Using a 12/1/01 effective date should allow sufficient time for execution by
both sides and getting our systems updated.
Thanks,
Jim

In response to your email here is the Amendment for Mitchell.  Please forward to your contact.  Regarding Avista,  I have not received the amendment to date.

  

Debra,

Kim Clausen has agreed, on behalf of the above referenced company, to have the GISB contract amended to designate ENA as confirming party.  Details are as follows:

Contract #: 96020382
E-mail:KClausen@mitchellgs.com
Phone: (713) 377-7090
Fax: (713) 377-6728

Please, if possible, give this amendment priority.  It is one of the "major problem counterparties" we discussed in the meeting.

Let me know if there is any way I can assist.

Thanks,

Ann

 
 have you heard from your sister? is she ok?

Debra Perlingiere

Yes, please sign the Amendment and return same to Enron.  Thanks!

Ann said to forward this to you. 

 Please work on this. Thanks!

Majed and/or Debra,
We have reviewed your comments regarding our Gisb special provisions which
incorporate your provisions.
Attached please find the document with some of our comments.  In particular,
we would like for you to articulate why some of the marked provisions are
outright unacceptable.  I hope that we can work together to create
compromise provisions which will be accetable to all.
Where possible, feel free to suggest alternate or edited language that
solves your objections.
Where entire provisions are unworkable, please give us some indication of
why you have reached that determination.
Also, please find a revised cover sheet atteched as well.
Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss these further.
Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Gerald/Debra,

There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc. contract. We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day. 

Also, could you please let me know approximately how long it will take to be able to provide Jill with a draft to send to the customer? We need to get something to the customer on Monday if at all possible.

Thanks,
Judy

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to "one sentence". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

The attached contract has reciprocal $10MM thresholds.  I did not agree to that with the counteraparty when I spoke to them on Friday afternoon.  I went ahead and only agreed to raise Duke's threshold to $5MM (and to keep ours at $10MM).

Please send a revised contract draft to the counterparty.

Hey lady,

Does the below referenced language work for you?

Let me know.

Thanks

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     " . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand."

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, "Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   "must pay within 5 business days" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted "excluding choice of law provisions . . . "
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie

I am the new law clerk taking over for Majed.  I hope that you had nice vacation.  I am working on some of the GISBs that Majed had been assigned before he left.  However, I have not been able to get very far due to the fact that I don't have all of the necessary information.  I hope that if you have a spare moment today, you can give me a little guidance as to what I should be doing.  I know the first day back is always very busy, so just let me know.

Alisha Mahabir

I was away June 29th and July 1-10.

That was in reference to the last pay period.  What dates were you gone for vacation?  Thanks Miss Sunshine!

I have no exceptions other than vacation, thanks!!!!!!!!!

Debra,

I forgot to get your time from you before you left for vacation, so I have entered straight regular time for you.  Please let me know if you have any exceptions, and I can make retro corrections one pay period back. Hope you are having a great vacation. Thanks!

 Hello Paramy,  I have sent vis messenger just now the executed agreement.  Thanks for all your help with this agreement.   I would like to visit with you next week.

Debra,

Hope you vacation was a good one.  Are you caught up with your work while
you were out? (Of course, not).  Just wanted to drop you a quick note and
check the status of our partially executed Master Agreement.

Thanks
Paramy

  I hope to be out from under the pile by early next week say Monday or Tuesday?

Thanks for the update.  When are you coming to visit me?

 Yes,  the agreement was under ENA.  The confirmation / contracts are on Stacy's desk for signature. The customer signed the contract/confirm with ENA !!  I question if this is really suppose to be ENA Upstream?    This deal was done with John Singer??  Can you speak with these guys?  Let me know as the contract and confrim has been signed.

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Regards,
Ellen

     The attached confirms/ contracts have been sent to Stephen DeBrular / Stevens Oil

 You know I had to look at this twice to figure out who it was.  You never know, it could be another bad egg searching for me.  How is aep?  Lets do lunch!!!!

Hey girl, did this reach you??? Not sure what your e:mail address is.  Write back if this is you!!!! 

 Regarding the guaranties, I am confused on the amount you want me to write for Corp. $30 or 20? Please let me know. Thanks!

Debra Perlingiere

 I look forward to it!!

Well, is this really you??????  Have not heard from you and was wondering where you were and what you were up to these days.... hope all is well with you.  I'm out next week for vacation, but on my return the week of July 23rd, let's meet for lunch. 
Take care and stay OUT OF TROUBLE.... 
  

	
  We have executed documents from the customer both a contract and confrim.  They will be fully exeucted by ENA and returned to the customer as such.  Confirmations regarding this contract must be confirmed under this agreement in the name of ENA.  We will not undo this agreement. 

Ellen,

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

John - Can you provide the Meter Name, number and working interest?

Judy
John,

Do we need to send out Revised Master under ENA Upstream Company LLC ?
Otherwise we have to send out a revised Confirmation under GTC.

Please let me know.

We need a written letter from the previous agent regarding transfer to new agent as well as a written document from the new agent consenting to same.  In addition,  the contract party should consent and acknowledge this transfer in written form. 

Just a quick check on the Ila Powell change of agent issue I had contacted you on (copy of email enclosed).  Synop-she had contacted us via written request (I faxed a copy to you) to change the agent listed in Counterparty, but the contract is in her name; you were going to let me know what steps she needs to take to correctly change agent from herself to her son. 

Regards,

Ruby Kyser

Good evening/morning.  I spoke to you last week regarding CPID 33395, Ila Powell, Agent and her request to have the agent name changed.  You had asked me to do some more research and find out what kind of contract we have with her and what she is "agent" for.  I spoke to Susan Ellidge in Contracts and she relayed that Enron has a Committed Reserves Agreement dated 1993 with Ila Powell, contract number 96002428.  The contract is between Enron and Ila Powell and she is listed on the contract as seller (of the commodity) and agent (for the wells involved).

The request we received, which I faxed a copy of to your office, states she wants all information on the wells sent to Dennis Powell, Agent (who is located at a different address/different state than the address we have for Ila Powell in GCP).  It also states she is no longer the agent.  I would like to call her advise her of a proper legal request for change of agent, but I have a feeling there will be more involved than a simple notarized request since there is a contract already in place.  Please advise what steps are needed to make this requested change of agent so that I may contact Ms Powell and relay the instructions in an intelligent manner (I am not legal savvy).

Your expertise and advise are greatly appreciated.

Anthony, 

Please contact Keith Ford at TXU Fuel and give him the info he needs to prepare a contract with ENA (Tax ID, payment info, etc.).  We need this to be effective June 1, 2001.  If you are not the correct person to handle this, please forward to the appropriate person.  Thanks.

At the request of Lynn Handlin, please find attached a copy of the following:
   GISB contract form
   Special Provisions for intrastate gas
   Special Provision for interstate gas

Please review, and if interested in putting these contracts in place, forward to
me all required information on the first page of the GISB contract form. I will
then have the contracts prepared and forwarded to you for execution.

Please keep in mind that TXU Fuel Company is an intrastate pipeline and can
purchase interstate gas only under certain limited conditions. These conditions
are covered under item number 8 in the Special Provisions. Thanks.

 How is Gail?

Debra Perlingiere

	
 TXU has requested we replace a previous GISB with HPL now assigned to AEP.   Because they are an intrastate pipeline they require a warranty from us that gas sold has been produced, transported and used only in Texas.  As ENA is interstate this is problem.  Please advise how you would like to proceed with this customer.

 Thanks !!

 I would like to use the following for the Flexible Pricing.   The last sen=
tence  regarding the keep whole verbiage I think you will want to delete th=
is as it does not allow for Force Majeure.

 FLEXIBLE PRICING: During the Period of Delivery for a Transaction, Custome=
r may request a price other than the original Contract Price, being a Fixed=
 Price or (each below defined) by contacting Company during Pricing Hours r=
equesting any such price for a specified quantity of Gas to be Scheduled du=
ring selected Months within the Period of Delivery; provided, such request =
must be made prior to 12:00 noon C.T. of the last Business Day prior to the=
 last trading Day of the NYMEX Gas futures contract for the selected Month.=
  A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible=
 Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fix=
ed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which=
 a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original =
Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to=
 the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's ac=
ceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmles=
s for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantit=
y of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quant=
ity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without =
limitation events of Force Majeure.

For the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" =20

Daily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily
 Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication,=
 in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geo=
graphic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the rele=
vant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for t=
hat particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices u=
nder the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average=
 of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoin=
t" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas D=
ay, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (d=
etermined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preced=
ing and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spo=
t Price can be determined.

Let  me know what you think.

 We cannot enter into  a contract with TXU as they require ENA to warrant gas sold is "intrastate" gas.  For obvious reasons this is not possible.  Please give me a call should you wish to discuss this further.

My apologies.  I meant to say deal 821869.  Thanks for the correction, Scott!

Just to clarify - 821869 is the affected deal.  872869 is a Conoco deal.

OK guys, I think we have it all figured out now.  Deal 872869 is truly a Crestar deal but the deal should have been input under Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. instead of Crestar Energy Inc. (which is now Gulf Canada Resources Limited).  Elizabeth has moved the deal to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. and the right contract is now attached.  Crestar will now be paid under Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.  as they have billed us.  

I hope this clears up any confusion.  Please feel free to call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Stacey - Let me add that Crestar is continuing to bill us under Crestar Energy Marketing.  So, they may need to be brought in the loop.

Thank you,

Patrice,

An update for you - Steve Van Hooser took this over from Dan but he is out of the office today.  I left a message on his voice mail and will let you know as soon as I hear from him.  I will request copies of the documentation from the Global Counterparty group in the meantime (Cheryl, can you send me a copy ASAP?).

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Oh my.....where is Dan Hyvl? we spent a great deal of time on scrubbing this issue down.  Let me get with Stacey!

I'll get back with you

I'm not sure what Dan's rationale was, but he's no longer here to ask.  Maybe we can have Gerald Nemec or Stacy Dickson Granmayeh look into it.  My documentation shows that Crestar Energy Inc. became Gulf Canada Resources Limited due to an amalgamation effective 03/01/01.  I don't have the documentation in hand but I can get a copy from the Global Counterparty group if necessary.  I don't understand why the deal should remain Crestar unless it's really under a Crestar entity that may not have been affected by the amalgamation????

Should deal 821869 be moved to Crestar?

fyi

Per Dan Hyvl, everything should be and will remain under Crestar.

Thanks

Patrice,

Should deal 821869 be booked under Gulf Canada Resources Limited or should it change to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Is there a point at which these deals will permanently remain under Gulf Canada Resources?  If not, can all future deals be moved over to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Please advise.

Ms. Heuser:

 
Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

I am not currently negotiating any deals with this counterparty.  If the contract is with HPL, any issues they have should be directed to AEP.  Also given your information regarding trade status,  I  would not consider entering into any type of contract with this company.  Finally, I can offer you no info with regards to the "LLC",  The only company I am aware of is "Upstream Energy Services Company.

While researching an EOL issue for Upstream Energy Services Company I noticed two records in the Global Counterparty Database that looked to be duplicates.

49992 Upstream Energy Services Company [Tradename]
92260 Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC	[Headquarters]

Both records are "active" (as they should be based on the current classification)

However, the note listed below seems to suggest that the customer is actually doing business as LLC:

 << OLE Object: PBrush >> 

The only master contract we had in existence was assigned to AEP/HPL and all current business is now conducted under GTCs. BOTH CP versions are EOL counterparties and both appear on the 7/19/01 Credit Watch Report as "No Trades" with an E-rating of 10.

The question: Should all activity actually be under only the LLC version? Knowing most traders, they are going to pick which ever one they happen to click on first.

Bryce: Does anyone in your group know any reasons why Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC would want to segregate invoices & payments? One under "Upstream Energy Services Company" & the other under "Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC"?

Donna: Is there a pathing issue that needs to keep transactions under both CP versions? One under "Upstream Energy Services Company" & the other under "Upstream Energy Services Company, LLC"?

Debbie: Since they are linked, we are capturing exposure for transactions under either. How would credit prefer to see this?

Stacey/Debra: Are we currently negotiating a replacement GISB with Upstream? If so, any idea which name is or will be on the contract?

Stephanie: What is EOL's view?

The reason I bring this issue to your attention is based on the previous discussions surrounding the debate and concern on downstream system and deal capture under Headquarters, Divisions & Tradenames. Given the obvious similarities of the names as listed in the Global Counterparty database, any confusion that can be avoided in the future would be a benefit for all groups.

Thank you!

Thanks, do I need to do anything to my outlook?

I wanted to make sure you saw this, I think you are going to have to start using Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com now otherwise your mail will start getting non-deliveries. I'll confirm with the messaging group but it sounds like your first instincts were right. 

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology
 
 
 
Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Hey Debra,

I have finished the revisions for the regular Masters as well as the EBTIDA agreements.  They are attached; they are also saved in your Contracts 2001 file.  If there are any problems just let me know.  

I also looked for the Hess file and I don't have it, nor do I have any notes for it.  I don't think that I worked on it although I may have looked over it for some reason.  Could you please check and see if you have something for them.

 Here are the most frequently used agreements for physical gas trades.  I draft and negotiate both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement as well as ENA's Spot Agreement and GISB.  If you have any questions,  I can explain the process including credits part.  Finally,  the Master Agreement was last revised in September of 1998.  These were minor revisions and I doubt you would ever have occasion to visit the 1998 form.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

This is a new worksheet for South Jersey. The threshold has been adjusted down to allow for financial trading under an ISDA(also working on that worksheet). Ann Koehler, in the financial legal group, was drafting language for amending the current incoming grty to include swap language. I am uncertain as to whether the amended grty can be applied to both contracts. If so, we need to have it increased to $8MM and indefinitely extended. Please coordinate with Anne.

The draft of the GAS Master was sent to Select in November of 2000.  As I am preparing to negotiate this do you want to change the credit terms?

Credit worksheets were sent out some time back for the preparation of an EEI, ISDA and Master Gas.  Since the ISDA and EEI have now been fully negotiated and executed, it would be a good place to start by reviewing these contracts. I believe the attys working on these were Carol St. Claire and Bob Bruce.  Please send a copy to credit for review prior to sending out to Select.

 Here are the confirms as discussed this morning. I need language for "Contract Price".

   

Debra Perlingiere

Yes,  I am sorry it has been so long.  The Gty is still in our corp. offices for execution.  I will check on status tomorrow.  Thanks for your email.

Debra,
I wanted to let you know that I have not yet received the Guaranty
Agreement under separate cover, as promised.
Sarai

I will give it outside work.

Are you worried that someone will intercept it, or you don't want me to have
it?

Did you have problems with someone bothering you and have to have it
changed?

I will NOT give out my #.  I have not been, hope to go this fall.

  Stacy  is working with Constellation on a Master / GISB 

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?  

Thanks,

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

when we had our phone conversation earlier this week, I agreed to obtain suggested language for 4.1 more clearly defining "associated costs" we discussed.  My attorney just got back to me and it is attached.

The contract # is 96053471.

Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation. 

Thanks

How about the others?

I estimate the monthly volumes for Cgas meter 711586  to be about 150 MMBTUs

Will you provide Debra with estimated metered volumes for the Reliance Energy meters which were to Mark Hardesty, Guy Dugan, Valley Petroleum, C&E Oilfield and Don McKee.
Thanks,
John
Thanks for your email.  However I need to know about volumes.  Is it 100% of production for these new contracts?  

 Thanks

I apologise for not listing  the pricing on my requests.  You are correct, the price is 100% of the TCo Appalachian Index.
Thanks,
John

Should I assume we are purchasing 100% of production for the last 6 you have sent me?

Would you please prepare and mail a new contract to:

Please contact Christina Finelli @ 713-853-9714.

Good morning Debra,

Could you help me on the following questions that we have:

1.	Could you tell me who the contract administrator or Paralegal would
be for Enron Energy Services.  Maybe it is you?
2.	If it is you, could send me electronically the Master Gas Agreement
for Enron Energy Services in word format?
3.	If you handle Enron Energy Services can we can do a gas long confirm
until we have the Master fully executed?
Sorry to shoot so many questions at you so early in the morning but if you
could let me know, I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

How much fun!!!!!!!  If I were younger I would  try technical climbing.  It requires lots of upper body strength as you know.  I envy you that sounds like great fun.  Let me know when you do Longs Peak!!

That is good news.  Now we have the GISB to finish off.

As for your question, I have been hiking, but not as much as I would like.
Actually, I'm hoping to pick up a weekend of intense instruction in
technical rock climbing near Estes Park in the near future.  The brother of
a friend is a serious climber and instructor who gives private lessons to
fund his ever-expanding collection of climbing toys.

                    Debra.Perlingiere
GOOD news I have the gty and will Fed X same to you today!!  Have you been
on any more hikes?

   Agreement under separate cover, as promised.
   Sarai

 Here is the revised version, please review and let me know if we need to amend further.

Thanks

 

Debra,

We need to change the pricing verbage. The price should not be 80% of IFHSC. The price for 80% of the volume is IFHSC - .075. Also, the price for the other 20% of the volume is GD - .065 and we should clarify that the GD is Houston Ship Channel. The new well pricing should also be HSC GD - .065. 

Also, I just want to clarify that this pricing is only effective as of January 1, 2002 through the end of the new term. It does not replace or restate the original pricing from the original effective date to the end of 2001. Based on the "replaces and restates" and the "effective date through December 31, 2001" wording, I was not sure. The other changes are effective from the contract effective date, but not the pricing.

Sorry for the confusion. Let me know if you need further information or if we need to discuss.

Thanks,
Judy

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Hi Anthony,

Please run a Sitara report for Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company to see any CURRENT deals pending for this counterparty.  Debra Perlingiere in Legal needs to know who the traders are dealing with this CP, so just spot check your list for about 20 deals.  I realize there are quite a few deals out there, but you can limit the list by running with flow dates from today forward.  Debra needs this information as soon as possible.  If you don't recognize any of the names who created the deal, check people finder.  Most of the book admins should be in the same cost center as the trader.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

    Dear Debra,

   I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for
lunch.
   I
   feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was
   interviewing
   for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town on
   Thursday
   of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me know.
I
   want
   you to fill me in on how you have been.

   Your law clerk,

   Majed Nachawati

    Mr. Nemec and I were wondering when you might make a time available

 Please send a credit worksheet for Kentucky Utilities Company.   My contact says LG&E / KUC purchase and sell as the same entity?

 Further to our conversation, with regards to the contracts, ENA prefers  two separate agreements one for each enitity. For accounting and legal reasons two agreements are necessary.  I will prepare a draft   for Kentucky Utilities Company if you wish to move forward.  Let me have your thoughts regarding this issue.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere

 It is me, thanks.

Debra,

I am not sure who is handling the GISB's now. Please forward to the appropriate person if it is not you. 

Thanks,
Judy

Judy,

1.  Section 6 in the rider is deleted in entirety and Section 6 of the GISB stands.

2.  A new Section 7.5 has been added.

3.  Lastly, the last 2 sentences of Article 13.9 are additions.

All options selected on the cover of the GISB are acceptable to Sequent

thanks

How about Friday?

I may go walk tonight or tomorrow, but as I said before, it probably would
not be until 7:00 or 7:30.  Let me know if you decide or you could just give
a ring (297-1875 as you probably remember) if you make a last minute
decision and see if it works for both.

Did not go out because of the heat and not feeling well. Would like togo
one night this week.

   How are things?  Did not see you out walking.  I was pretty busy over
   the
   weekend myself.

    We did not go out due to heat. Maybe one evening at the end of the
   week?

         Have not gone yet, but planning to in October.  Jo Ellen and Bob
   are
         coming
         down and we are planning to drive out for about a week.  Should be
      fun.
         Charlotte and Bill are going to visit in September but we probably
      will
         not
         go much further than San Antonio.  How about you?  Are you going
   or
      have
         you
         been?

         I did not understand your message about your phone number.  You
   will
      or
         will
         not email it?

 Please discuss this with Steve. 

I changed my mind. Let them come back to us before i do another worksheet.

 Please send a credit worksheet for Kentucky Utilities Company.   My contact says LG&E / KUC purchase and sell as the same entity?

Debra Perlingiere

Please feel free to attend.

Alisha and I wanted to go to the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt for a while. Is it OK or do you have something that you want us to do instead? If we go we will probably be there for about 45 minutes to an hour.

Chike

Here is the revised Confirm.  Please review.

 

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

See you Friday!!!

Great,

I drive a 93 Honda Accord that is sort of Purple, so be on the lookout. I
will pick both of you up at 12:00 on Friday the 17th for lunch at Irma's on
me. I will pick you up in front of Enron where they usually have that lunch
party event, or in other words, the side street that has the cathedral on
the opposite side facing the Enron building.

Looking forward to lunch,

Majed

That sounds good.  We'll see you at 12 on Friday.

    Dear Debra and Gerald,

   Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could
   pick
   you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in
   downtown(they
   have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch,
so
   if
   your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
   Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

   Best Regards,

   Majed Nachawati

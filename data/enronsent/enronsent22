i guess we know why it tanked now -- i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - i would believe anything - this sucks -- we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say

the 14th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 7th

The two dates to choose from are December 7 and December 14 both on Fridays due to company Christmas party conflicts. 

We have decided to do it at two houses with heavy hors 'd vours, dessert and drinks.  The progressive dinner format takes too long and this will allow us to actually play   with our husbands. 

Please Email me your date preference and I will get back with you on the date chosen and I will get back to you with all the other details. 

I don't think you would really want to be here right now anyway.  Not the best environment - besides - you hate Houston, right?  Have you gotten any other leads?

thanks for the pics, 

your doucheboy H.R. guy evaporated like a fart in the wind.  he must have realized how underqualified i am.

sounds like you have some good prospects - if you can land something decent in this economy then i think you're doin okay.  good luck - keep me updated.

indeed i did not enjoy my time in houston but put me in the caboose of the enron express and i think i could put up with it for another year.....  just got off a phone interview with arthur andersen for a commodities analyst positioin in chicago, went pretty well i guess.  I also have head hunters trying to get me into AEP and a friend at Aquila trying to backdoor me at that joint.  i could be moving my shit just about anywhere in the next few weeks.

okay - so here's the deal - ugh - i hate to say this but we may have to postpone again.  pat's parents were supposed to come last weekend and they didnt because pat's dad was sick, so they are thinking of coming this weekend instead.  they usually leave pretty early on sunday, but with your time constraints with the foleys thing - i dont know if we'll be able to squeeze it in the middle.  i'll let you know if anything changes - if not, it may be back to the drawing board.
 
i saw terra, di ,and nicole this weekend in austin - it was great to hang out with nicole if only for a little bit.  
 
how's john's job search going?  it's pretty rough out there - i've been thinking about you guys alot, hoping he can get something soon.
 
anyway - i'll let you go -- take care.

What a cutie!  Will I be able to see her in person on the 28th?  You are
welcome to bring her!

Are you still up for next Sunday.  If so....ya'll could plan on coming at
12:30 or so.  We can cook out and also take a tour of the canals on our
little boat if ya'll are up for it and ...... if the weather cooperates.
If Erin isn't ready for her boat rides we can take turns going!

John and I have to go to Memorial City that night for a opening party.
It's casual, but we would need to start getting ready around 4 or so!

What do you think?

Cathy

i think it's going to be virtually impossible for me to skip out early on afternoon meetings for a while.  So, i may end up having to be here til 5 on days that we have the bigger  ones.  this sucks but i think i just have to out up with it for a while.  you okay with this?

insiders starting to buy here 

ok - so it looks like pats mom has to work on sunday so i guess it's back on - we should be able to get there at about 12:30.  what do you want me to bring?

Let me know if anything changes with the parental visit.  I'm sure we can
find another time.

You're right...it is rough out there on the job search front.  He's still
keeping a positive attitude though, so hopefully something will work out
soon.

I talked to Diane for a quick minute, and she said that she had a lot of
fun in Austin.  I miss Nicole!

Okay, here's what you're supposed to do... and try not to be LAME and

   they apply to you. Then, send this to a bunch of people you know

ok - my opinion - i think signs are enough but am not opposed to pitching in for an ad, i will try my best to come over friday night but if i cant - what time will you be up on saturday?

Hello All!

Just wanted to give you guys an update.  The weather looks good for the
garage sale this weekend.  So that is a good thing.  

If you want to bring your stuff by Friday evening, that might be a good plan
for us all to get things set up.  That way all we have to do saturday
morning is drag the tables out of the garage.  Also, I do not have a rack
for hanging clothes, so they will have to be folded or hung on the fence.

How about coming over friday evening around 630-7pm.  Also, if you have any
card tables, please bring them.  I have one and am borrowing two from my
parents.  But I am sure we may need a couple of more.

I bought a couple of garage sale signs on Monday and plan to put them out on
the main street, South Braeswood.  Another idea would be for us to take out
an ad in the greensheet.  Someone told me they cost around $15.  I am in the
process of getting some info as to the exact cost and will let you know when
i get the info confirmed. I am leaving that up to the majority vote as to
whether we all chip in for the add or not.  I think it may be worth it, some
people look for those adds and spend all day saturday doing garage sales.
But whatever you guys think

The hours of the Sale will be from 7am-1230ish.  I think by then whatever
doesn't sale either goes home or to goodwill.  I know some of you cant be
there all day or right at 7am, but I will need some help so let me know what
time you plan on coming over that morning.

Ok, so to summarize all my chatter, 3 questions, 1:  do we take out an ad in
the greensheet?   2: are you coming over friday to set up? and 3:  what time
will you be there on sat?

See ya

Jennifer  

i have a table and chairs, coffee table, vacuum cleaner, pictures, dishes, thats about it i think

you are the first to reply. So I will let you know about the consensus on
the ad thing.  

We will probably be up around 615 on Saturday.  I don't plan on fixing
myself up for the event.  Probably just throw on some shorts and a hat.  

So if you can't make it Friday, then let me know what time you were thinking
on Saturday.  No big deal, just wanted to mention that we would be home on
friday evening for those who wanted to bring the stuff over that night.

So what all do you have for the sale??

I have a coffee table, end table, typewriter, stereo speakers and then some
other misc stuff.

sounds great

With most of the email responses back, the consensus is that there is no consensus.  Half of the people can make it on the 7th, and the other half can make it on the 14th.  Since we cannot get the majority of the people together, I suggest that we have a beginning of the New Year party with the significant others sometime in January.  Please let me know if this is OK with you. 

Thanks, 
Kim 

yeah - last week was just a case of bad timing - come back soon!

too cute!!!!!  Hopefully I'll get to see her in person soon.

sorry I missed you in Houston last week - I'll call you.

Great Pictures!  Too bad you have to go back to real life.  Anything new on the job search?

see - great minds think alike ----- also - check this out ---- from corporate security
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  
We just refinanced this past Monday.  We were going to do a 15 year at 6%,
but changed our minds and decided to do the 30 year again, but could only
get 6-5/8% (still much better than the 8% we had before).  We are still
going to pay on it like a 15 year mortgage, but the 30 years gives us
flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency.  5.75% sounds
really good -- do you have to pay points to get it that low?  I like 15 year
loans for the interest rate, but like 30 year loans for the flexibility --
it's really a matter of personal choice.  That's why we went with the 30
year and will pay like a 15 -- it costs a little more (due to int rate) than
a straight 15 year mortgage, but is kind of an insurance policy because you
only have to pay the small 30 year payment.  Sorry to hear about the golf
membership.  I know how much you enjoyed that.  We have focused this entire
year on paying down debt, so we really haven't saved anything other than
401k and ESPP.  However, we payed off my student loans back in March and
will pay off the car next month (yeah!!).  After next month, our only debt
will be the house.

We are just glad that Tori is up this year and was up last year in her book.
Basically, her desk has agreed to put their head down and make as much money
as possible.  That way, if the axe starts falling, it falls somewhere else. 

The employees in general are disgusted with upper management and would
prefer for all of them to be replaced.  Who knows, if the stock remains too
low you would have to consider the possibility of a hostile takeover (i.e.,
GE, Exxon etc..).  All speculation of course.  In short, we have lost alot
of money and are making changes in our finances to accomodate in future
issues.  No more golf membership :(   

We are considering refinancing again at 5.75 for 15 years.  It saves us 160K
over the life of the loan.  Any thoughts on 15yr mortgages?

Not much going on.  I am hoping CPN stays low for about another 5 weeks so I
can load up with my ESPP $.  I get a 15% discount on the price on the last
day of Nov.  How are things going with Tori over at Enron -- it sounds like
they are in a bad situation over there.

Loaded the boat this morning in the low 23 range.  Go CPN :)

Anything new with you guys.  I could have bought a house with the monies we
lost ENE stock options - just kidding of cours.

Still in the process of refinancing - we should close in a couple of weeks.
Susan doesn't want to start trying for a baby until after the holidays.  The
answer to your Calpine question is a little complex, but the short and
simple answer is the following:

1.  Although there is a lot of new power coming online, most companies are
not accounting for the fact that a lot of the old generation will be
displaced by the new generation (i.e. the new generation is much cheaper to
operate, so it will "win" the battle in the end).

2.  New power generation has not kept up with the growth of the 80's and
90's - plain and simple, this is a fact.  However, if we go into a
long-lived recession, some of the growth will erode.

3.  A lot of the current plans for more generation will not materialize.
Many companies will shut down plans to build more generation because of
fears of over-building.  Whoever gets the new generation on the ground first
will force the other companies to back off.  In the 80's, Calpine's CEO
recognized the fact that there would be a lack of power in the US by the
late 90's and into the 2000's.  Therefore, he bought call options from the
major turbine producers (GE, Westinghouse, etc.) which gives us the rights
to a large portion of the turbines that are currently being built and will
be built over the next few years.     

Jake,

What does Calpine see that the rest of the world doesn't when it comes to
power?   Calpine keeps building-out to produce more power and the so called
"experts" indicate there is a glut of power coming out.  I don't
understand..   Any thoughts?

I heard you guys refinanced the house :).   I hope everything is going well
over at CPN.   Any new developments on the Baby front or are you guys just
still practicing :).

i probably cant find a baby sitter that late on a thursday

Ed and I are getting tickets to Tuna Christmas and wanted to know if any of
you were interested in going with us.  Here is the scoop:

Date:	Thursday Dec. 13th 8pm

Where:  Galveston, The Opera House.   I know it won't be a fun drive home
but the show is not coming to Houston this year.

Ticket Price: $36 or less.  We are getting the 36 tickets as I want good
seats on the first level.  However, we may not all be able to sit together.

I thought it would be fun to leave Houston a little early on Thursday, say
by 430ish and drive to Galveston for dinner somewhere and then go to the
play.

Let me know if you are interested in going, I plan on getting our tickets by
tomorrow.

Jennifer

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.  

Sure thing!  I will give it to her in the morning.

$3,000 by $65. Thank you!!

We have been asked to collect the money by Friday, May 19, so if you will 
call me once your check is ready, I will be glad to pick it up.  Please make

Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird

I need you guys to confirm that you are available June 3rd (Saturday) for the 
ENA super saturday.  P.S.  you need to say yes.

Jeff, I don't know any of the Houston guys and I don't think the Calgary guys

Just as a reminder to everyone, there is a meeting in John Lavorato's office 
this Friday June 2nd regarding Dayrates

John

Enclosed is the presentation that Keith MacIvor and I gave to Noble 
Drilling's CEO, Jim Day and Pride International's CEO, Paul Bragg, their CFO, 
Earl McNiel, and their COO, James Allen this morning 5/30.  Both sets of 
leaders were extremely interested in pursuing dayrate transactions with us.  
Both sets said that they believed this product would have a very positive 
impact of the drilling business.

Jim Day assigned us to his leading financial innovators, Mark May and Steve 
Manz.  Paul Bragg and Earl McNiel are wanting to sign an ISDA asap and begin 
discussions asap.

 I will be giving the same presentation to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, Jim 
Tisch this Thursday (in New York) and a "deal specific" presentation to the 
CFO of Chiles Offshore the same day.

I hear you.  However, this big a difference doesn't make sense to me.  Are 
the scalers and the vol marked correctly.

I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.  They are 
interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.  I am sending 
them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 
17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.   Again, this payment would come from the 
U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I 
suggest we get on it quickly.  I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding 
and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.  I'm in 
Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.

1.  Ask Iris how fast she can get more clocks, I would like to send some to 
my brokers.  Also get me a list of who our marketers are sending gifts to.

2.  Tell Milly I'm requesting 3000 for the Order of Good Cheer and that I

3.  

Hello again everyone.  One last structure pre-christmas.  I'm am working on 
an option structure with TD bank that would see 20,000,000 CAD go out the 
door on Wednesday December 22nd or Thursday December 23rd.  There will be no 
special documentation necessary, only standard option confirmations.  The 
money will return equally over the 12 months of 2000.  TD is charging us a 
fee of 50K CAD for the idea but since it is different than the deals we have 
already done I'm OK with it.  What I need is the following.

1 -  If there are any questions or concerns please call me early Monday 
morning.

2 - Jordon - Please call me and give me your OK.

3.  Juanita - Let me know if you can handle the payment in time.

4.  Joe - How's are Line of Credit coming - we're running out of time.

John,
Doug asked me to send you the amended model for the proposed collar structure.
You will see that is is essentially a larger version of the previous model, as
it covers the full calender year of 2000.  There are therefore 48 options 
which
results in daily volume being reduced to 42K GJ/Day.  There is an amortization
schedule to the far right which calculates the implied interest rate on the
deal.  Call me if you have any questions about the model or changes you would
like to see.

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

Cliff I want to add a seat between Chad and the window.  Can you check it 
out.  John.

I'm going to extend and offer to someone who currently works at Koch.  I will 
extend the offer at the Director level but this person could easily pass as a 
Vice President.  I think I need to add some stock or options to the offer.  
Can you please advise me on how I can accomplish this.

Thanks

John Lavorato

Dawn, call me on Lambie and Brodeur.

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position.

John,

Sorry to bother you with this but, we are working with these cities to assess 
the extension of their gas supply contracts with Engage.

The price under the Engage contracts is effective July 1st - June 30th of 
each year and is based upon indices in the US Southwest and Alberta for the 
previous 12 months.  Thus, we can project the price for the contract and 
compare it to our forward curve (at AECO) to determine the best course of 
action:  extend or terminate.

The following summarizes the comparative pricing I need.  If the analysis 
indicates that these contracts should be terminated, Enron would be in a 
position to supply gas to these entities at AECO.

Quantity:    8,000 MMBtu/d baseload
Term:     July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2001
Delivery Point:   NIT (AECO)
Pricing:    Fixed in $US/MMBtu

Thanks for your help,

Laird

The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit 
today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.  
This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a 
performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I 
expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following 
ways:

1.  Understanding the fundamentals.
2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4.  Developing new traders.

Sent by: Nella Cappelletto@ECT
I have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited 
liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the 
PPAs.  The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following:

1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron 
Canada entity at this point.  I believe that it would be more sellable if 
that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified 
Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada 
entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp.  I need to discuss this matter 
further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.

2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free 
from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding 
on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment 
obligations under the PPA.  In other words, the Guarantee guarantees 
"Obligations" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs 
themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including 
in "Obligations" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves.

3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit 
exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such 
Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past 
the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common 
law relating to "piercing the corporate veil", which in essence means that 
the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity 
can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was 
established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly 
attributable to the shareholder.  Although this is a difficult test to prove 
given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability 
entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way 
that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a 
separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees, 
separate operating agreements and leases, etc.).  As mentioned, however, it 
is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish 
a case where the courts will allow the "corporate veil" protecting 
shareholders to be "pierced".

4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability 
entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of 
control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax 
losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.  Obviously, 
however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the 
special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the 
liabilities for any acquired PPA.  Otherwise, the general rule is that the 
tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and 
would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.

5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case 
authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and 
when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent 
Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such 
as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity.  In 
other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting 
Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the 
Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon 
Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power 
Pool.

Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more 
detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock 
and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose 
entity.

Regards, Peter

Please excuse Kim Hillis and Kay Chapman from SAP timekeeping class and 
provide them with the necessary tools to learn this at their desks.  I 
understand that with this dismissal that they will be required to learn it on 
their own. 

Kim Hillis is currently registered for the class on Thursday, June 29 and Kay 
Chapman had Beverly Stephens attend on her behalf.

Please provide them with a contact name in the event that they have any 
questions.

This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
"Cross Commodity Trading Group" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

John

We're back baby.

Rick

I wasn't double counting.  My 5 Million was the Cross commodity group.  I'm 
fine with your comments re. Sherriff.

Dan, we need to talk about cancelling some of our Telerate feeds.

I hope to spend more time with you guys in the future.  I am also working on 
the human resource issues you mentioned.

1.  Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.

2.  How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.

Talk to you soon.

John Lavorato

Sorry Vince I have been out of town.  Please give me a call tomorrow.

I've told Presto to relax 17 times.  Just deal with me on this one.
	
	

Please give me an update on the overall status of Chris Dorland relocation 
from Calgary to Houston.  As Lavo has already indicated to you, Chris will be 
joining the East Power Trading group as the PJM cash trader.  Chris is 
anxious to get the process rolling so he can make the transition to Houston 
no later than October 2, 2000.  In particular the following package needs to 
be put together and overnighted to Chris this week.

 1) Visa paperwork (Canada to US)
 2) Relocation specifics (move coordination & $'s for move)
 3) New US salary (Chris expectation is $80k/yr US)

Please give me an update as soon as possible.

Thanks David.

Kathryn

Although we are a qualified bidder, we still have not made the decision to 
bid.  I would try to avoid discussing but if you need to give me a call.

I have a 1:10 meeting so I can't attend your marketing meeting.  I thought it 
might be a good idea to grab Lambie at noon and get him to attend your whole 
meeting.  He might have some insights into Alliance among other things.

Please respond with a plan to solve these problems.

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Ravi,
       Please advise your users that athena will be completely unavailable 
starting

quark is configured to our standard for your use.
Thanks,

Let me know if she doesn't solve your problems.
John,

As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  us 
isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our 
code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application 
specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource is 
scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX 
administrators working along side the Sun resources.

As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side 
of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are 
putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously 
impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.

These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very 
diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in 
additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources 
at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to 
enhance our existing systems.

Please respond with a plan to solve these problems.

Thanks John
	
	

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Can you get me a copy of the final PRC results for all employees in ENA.

Ed

As well as Dave's suggestions, I would like to see value per transaction 
which I'm told you keep track of.

Oxley

Change it to 150 and 100 on Long term comp and ignore the bonus target and 
send it back to me.  I will forward it to Belden with a note.  

Thanks

Dave

Following up on our summit.  I wrote down that you would follow up on the 
synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by 
Scott Tholen.   I would be happy to coordinate this myself.  Please write 
back and let me know if this is okay.

I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and 
demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom 
on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders 
that you think would benefit from it.

This is to confirm a meeting for tomorrow, Tuesday, July 11 at 2:00 pm.  
Please reference the meeting as Systems Meeting and also note that there will 
be a follow up meeting.   The meeting will be held in EB3321.  

Call Kim Hillis at x30681 if you have any questions.

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

I have a meeting at 1:15, I assume in my office, with some Houston folks.  
The topic a potential purchase of 
Westcoast.  I would like both of you to attend.

I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for 
the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 
45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very 
bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are 
eating up a lot of var.

Please advise.

Can we do it without the bonus target.

This is the most bizarre resume I've seen in a long time.

I guess we were wrong.

We were totally surprised by the a.g.a. number.  We need to work on are 
ability to predict it.  

Therefore, we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 40 
Million limit.   I don't think there is any reason to change what we did 
today.  We will keep it in our pocket for 10 days unless you disagree.

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we 
enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or 
course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation 
site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally 
and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with 
Phillippe or do anything else?

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.

*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as 
the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all 
completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies 
have you brought on-line, etc.

 summary:
  - coverage metrics;
  - market iniatives;
  - completed deals;
  - hot list;
  - EOL metrics.

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something "half-baked".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow "hot list" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.

Dave,

We had a meeting today with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, Greg Whalley, Ted Murphy, 
Bill Bradford, Mark Haedicke, Julia Murray, Tim Belden, Elliot Mainzer, Derek 
Davies, Rob Milnthorp, and Peter Keohane regarding Alberta PPA.

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to 
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including 
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the 
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the 
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for 
Ontario.  

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto 
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could 
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have 
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use 
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, 
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know 
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

When we have made some inroads into SO2 analysis please set up another 
meeting with me.

No hurry.  You guys just peeked my interest last time and I would like to 
continue discussions.

John

I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.

Please see the attached memo regarding the Antitrust Training.

I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the 
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there 
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review 
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to 
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once 
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share them 
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  We 
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front end 
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.

Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of 
the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.

I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named 
President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop 
to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was 
absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with 
very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's 
bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading 
and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create 
liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  
So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help 
build revolutionary new businesses.

What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk 
management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our 
outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These 
businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different 
variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage 
in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't 
put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other 
commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to 
figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if 
you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down 
here! .... we need you!

John's callout quote

Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't 
fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll 
excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

equivalent to $80k annually.  If  Enron breaks the contract within three 
months Mark will be paid a breakage fee of 20k.  If contract is broken after 
three months Mark will be paid the amount remaining under his agreement.   If 
Mark is hired full time during this contract there will be no associated fee 
involved.

Sorry I didn't get back quickly.

You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate 
perspective.  In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of 
what they would try to do in the next little while. (ie how much one way 
exposure)  This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they 
prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market.

Mr. Jeff Shankman
Dear Mr. Shankman:

I  am  writing to inquire about positions in natural gas trading with Enron
North  America.   I  have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for the
last  four  months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up a
profit/loss  report  for  the  various regions within the United States for
EOTT's  crude  oil trading and marketing business.  Previously, I worked in
the  energy  industry  for  over  two  years  in  trading, risk management,
structured  products  and  marketing of electricity and natural gas for the
western  United  States.   Additionally,  I  was  actively  involved in the
physical  markets  and  gained  a strong understanding of the western grid.
Furthermore,  I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledge
of the commodity and financial markets.  Moreover, I have also traded NYMEX
natural  gas  futures,  options  on futures, forward contracts for physical
power  and  options  in  SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.  Finally, I
have  had  experience  setting  up/operating  market  simulation models and
maintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.  Prior to
entering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager for
Mellon  Mortgage  Company  in  Houston,  Texas.   At  Mellon,  I positively
affected  the  bottom  line  performance  of the company for over two years
through  strategic  trading  and  hedging of mortgage backed securities.  I
received the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer for
outstanding  financial  performance  and  the  Employee  Choice  Award from
co-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.  My expertise with listed
futures  and  options  on  futures,  OTC  options and swaps, as well as the
ability  to  positively  affect  the  bottom  line could definitely make an
impact  with  your  team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurial
personality  allows  me to constantly look for profitable solutions or cost
effective ways of managing risk.

As  you  will  note  from  the  enclosed  resume, I managed the trading and
hedging  of  the  interest  rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon Mortgage
Company.   The  interest  rate risk was managed by use of forward sales and
purchases  of  mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgage
backed securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.  In addition,  futures and
options on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used at
the  appropriate  time  taking into account the basis between mortgages and
treasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
in  New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked for
Garvin  Guybutler  Corporation,  a  major  international  money and deposit
broker.    Primary  responsibilities  at  Garvin  included  uncovering  and
executing  arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placement
yields   and   reduce   borrowing  costs  relative  to  Eurodollar  deposit
transactions  of  similar  maturities.   In addition, I was involved in the
brokering   of   Term  Federal  Funds,  EuroDollar  deposits,  EuroCurrency
deposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements.

It  would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learn

Attached is a memo detailing Antitrust Training.

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits 
taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to 
turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in 
the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in 
Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought 
traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has 
bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very 
worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and 
reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and 
the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the 
continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank 
that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours 
devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this 
implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I 
think this will start our organization to think a little differently and 
hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in 
months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

John

Please be aware of the following senior personnel departures from ENA which 
have occurred in the last two weeks:

Craig Childers - Effective February 1, 2000, Craig has joined Enron Energy 
Services.

Kevin McConville - has left the Company effective immediately. Please direct 
all business related questions to Greg Whalley.   If you need to contact 
Kevin, please call me first.   Although news of his departure is not 
sensitive, as with all employee departures, please refrain from any 
additional commentary and make every effort to discourage any of your direct 
reports from open discussion of the subject.

Mike McCall - has left the Company effective immediately.   The company 
policy generally is not to provide any type of reference for former 
employees.  Mike has requested that we respond to such requests as he seeks 
other employment.  Consequently, in the event that any external party should 
inquire as to Mike's position at Enron, please refer them to me, and on no

Thanks for the increased VAR.  We got it right this time.

I would like to request an extension of the 45 million limit until Friday.  
We like gas and we would like to maximize this move.

The PPA auction is going along well I think.  We are leading on Sundance B 
and have been for 3 rounds now.  Some weird things are occuring so it is too 
early to tell what will utimately happen.  The government has said that it 
will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.  We 
would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B.  
Currently we are bid  $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD.  
But again its too early to get our hopes up.

Does this mean that we have no VAR limit during this time.

That's great.  Please don't let Len delay.

I wonder with Joe Sutton gone if they can cancel the worldwide Analyst and 
Associate PRC.  It take a lot of time away from our people and we are ranking 
them ourselves anyway.

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:

As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

Just to be clear.  There will be no re-allocations of analysts and associates

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.

Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact

A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.

1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to 
replace Access and to handle basis trading.
   The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis 
products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), 
Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.

2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players 
with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the 
current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board 
in the    next few weeks.    

3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the 
weekly storage data.     

4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount 
through the Hub for volume commitment. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

What have you been smoking.

Make sure we don't lose these two to Jeff.  Call Celeste and tell them that 
we have place them in gas.

Sorry If you tried to look at the web site:

The IT development group was working on it so it was out of commission.  It 
is available now.  However, like I indicated it is only a template.

I talked to Whalley about it a little bit.  The one issue is that when we 
liquidate a bad position they get out first.  Think about it.

Andre Templeman@ECT

We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next 
day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which 
is rare and all marketer deals.  If we do this we might consider keeping the 
tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.  

Please advise.

I really think we can do this more systematically.  Give me a little time.  
ie.  Trust me I'm the Godfather.

Dave

I hate to make the management committee too big but how about Scott Tholen.  
He is very high quality.

Can you please help Greg get this info.  I have to think that we have this 
info somewhere.
Greg Couch@ECT
08/16/2000 02:08 PM
John,

I want to update you on the additional information you requested yesterday 
(intrinsic and extrinsic $ assigned to each deal when originally booked).  

Due to changes in personnel, the time that has elapsed, and the Excel model 
used in the original valuation of the deals, obtaining the initial values has 
proven to be more of a challenge than I had initially anticipated.  I am 
working with the current book administrators for the transport model to pull 
together what information we can find.  I have also spoken with Colleen and 
placed phone calls to the prior (and original) administrator of the transport 
option model.

I am not sure, at this point, that we will be able to pin down the original 
values for all of the deals.  I will get you what I can, as soon as I can.  
In the meantime, please let me know if you have questions and/or concerns.

Greg

Jessica,

I have resent the information to you with the requested signatures.  Could 
you please provide me with the exact address so that I can send this

Hi John:

I received your faxed guarantee offer.  We need the original copies of the 
guarantee offer sent to us by courier before takeover.  Also please make sure 
to have you signatures on the original copies witnessed.

I have spoken to Wayne Coultry and takeover date has tentatively been set for 
Wednesday August 23/00.

I have spoken to Angela, Len Wong's assistant and she is going to contact the 
contractor - Brad Askin to begin repairs on the property immediately.

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,  Jessica

A couple questions.

Do I need to do anything next Wednesday or will money just hit my accout?

Will you pay the contractor and if so why is Len Wong involved?

John

Also can you make sure that I have a computer set up for me in Portland and 
Calgary and that it gets me into my network.  I especially need to be able to 
get into the executive reports.

Dave

We need to think about trying to get more VAR for the gas floor before all 
these other commodities go to the Board and scare the hell out of them.  I 
have several reasons for this so lets discuss.

Lavo

10 Million - Pan Nat gas purchase from Duke - Contract allows for price 
determination.

10 Million - Tolls Risk associated with PGT transport that expires in 2023.

10 Million  - Index Risk at Chicago as a result of the Peoples transaction

I'll call you later today.

We won a PPA in Alberta.  We will know for sure on Thursday when the 
government declares the auctin a success or not.  It is highly like that it 
will be a success.

Please direct all detailed questions through Derek Davies in Canada

The auction is now closed -- no more rounds will be run.  In round 70, there
were no new bids, no bid withdrawals, and no proactive waivers submitted.
In accordance with the auction rules, the Minister of Resource Development
will decide no later than Thursday, August 24 whether to accept all winning
bids or to reject all winning bids.  Names of standing high bidders will not
be revealed before the Minister's decision.

Can you re submit me the utilities in Alberta including gas.

Given our current views of the natural gas markets, we are requesting an 
increase in our VAR limits from 40 million to 45 million until next Tuesday.

If this is OK with you its OK with me.  
	
	

John:

My name is Husnain Mirza. I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.  
I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On 
August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the 
dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there 
would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I 
should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. 

After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go 
to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul 
Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who 
might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi 
Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi 
talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom 
background. 

My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically 
working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of 
fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim 
wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams 
Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the 
afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. 
He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.

Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer 
and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I 
told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution 
to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth 
opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to 
EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my 
transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).  

Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my 
transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support 
for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except 
that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.  
Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would 
appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this 
opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

Regards,

Husnain Mirza

so you can transfer to EBS.

The fellow in Andea Reed's group is all yours.  

P.S.  How is our trade coming along.

Phillip Allen will put 50 Million in Schedule C reserve on August 23rd and 
Mike Grigsby and Kieth Holst will put 25 Million each on August 24th.  

Change Holst and Grigsby to 35 Million and 35 Million.

should be checking emails throughout the next week.  If you believe this 
matter requires his immediate response, please call and let me know or leave

John:

In the past couple weeks, Janelle Scheuer has been contacted about a couple 
job opportunities. Initially by someone on the crude desk offering her a job 
to head
their marketing group. Jeff Shankman followed up to encourage her to become a 
candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta approached Janelle to ask if
she would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's 
Industrial Group. 

My concern is  that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to 
check if it would be appropriate to discuss job opportunities with Janelle. 
Given that she has been in power for only  5 months and is performing a 
critical role in our effort to increase deal flow, I will be in a bind if I 
loose her. Janelle did the right thing by divulging this information. I 
wanted you to be aware of this.

Thanks,   Ed

up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Just wanted to confirm that Li will be placed in Vince Kaminski's group.

Please contact me at 3-4584 if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help!!

Shelly

   
	
	

Shelly, 

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  

Thanks for your help.

Jeff

Can I please see the resumes.

I keep hearing that Mcsherry is gone yet his xxxxxx name keeps coming up.

Lavo

The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial 
managers.  

I'm in Vegas this weekend, want to come. 

P.S.  We should play soon I have averaged 94 in my last 5 rounds.

Good Job!

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.

As a result of meetings in Calgary last week, I have come up with the 
following capabilities that we need to develop in Calgary to effectively 
trade, schedule, and settle in that market.  I envision a series of 
transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for 
transferring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power 
desks up to the Calgary office.  These are my initial thoughts.  Things will 
obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the 
head of the desk in place.

Trading
Transition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Bill Greenizen
Hire head trader.  John L. and Tim are currently working with John Zufferli 
to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.  John Z. is planning a 
trip to Portland and Calgary as soon as he is able to fly.  Hopefully the 
week of September 16th.
Get EOL products defined and posted.  Greenizen hopes to get this done by 
September 16th.
Develop curves.  Currently using implied PPA bid curves.
Develop position reports.
Give offers to origination team.  Tim/Mike/Bill will provide prices to 
origination until head trader has been hired.

Risk
Transition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ??
Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk process and 
book deals.
Book positions.  In process of entering five deals.  One for each unit, line 
losses for each unit, and payment for the PPA.  Will run mini book to ensure 
that close to zero value is created when all deals are booked and run against 
our curves.  Should have this done by September 8th.
Drop curves.
Create position reports.

Scheduling
Transition team - Jeff Richter, Bill Greenizen, Peggy H.
Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta.
Learn about California scheduling systems.
Assess applicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market.
Hire a scheduler.

Real Time
Transition team - John Forney
Assess whether we need to run real time group in Calgary.  We may be able to 
start with someone on days and have nights and weekends covered from 
Portland.  Legal issues with Portland providing service to Calgary.
Assuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.  
We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.

Fundamentals
Transition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ??, and Chris Wiebe
We can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before 
January.  We have the systems and most likely the staff to come up with the 
first generation of Alberta fundamentals.
Train a person who will eventually be located in Calgary on West Power 
Fundamentals -- systems and processes.  Stephan or Chris W. may fit this 
bill.  Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.
We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and 
now works for structuring in Houston.  He is not interested in relocating to 
Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.
Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.  Derek 
will work on this.  Sanjeev may have some ideas here.
Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.  Dan 
Dietrich.

Volume Management
Transition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura Scott
Learn market rules for settlements.  Get 1 person from Derek's group to try 
to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract 
side.
Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements 
and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job.
Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work.
Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.  We are currently assessing 
whether anyone from Portland could do this job.

I will be out of the office until September 16th.  We have already made plans 
for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our 
systems and processes.  Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down 
the head trader position.  Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there 
is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.  It may be 
worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.

I'm off to Montana for a week.  Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch 
with me.  She can be reached at 503-464-3820.

Regards,
Tim

Looks great.  I think we should have a least 1 or 2 real time traders in 
Calgary.

Dave

As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to 
have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to 
get a sense of how many people we hire.  Might even need the number of hires 
and fires/resignations.  My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it 
would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would 
be made.

Beth

I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems 
perspective.  I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.  We simple 
do not have one.  From there I will coordinate with traders and back office 
to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.  My new motto is 
"Systems will be fixed or people will die".  I will keep you informed.

John

Can I also get a copy of his resume.

I know you are screwing with me.

If you are not.  NO!

Can I please extend the 45 million var and the contracts in the power book 
until the Board meeting on October 11th.

My opinion is that you need a budget.

I'm expecting more details from Bill re. Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about 
this.  I will deal with my traders when I have the details.  On the Retail 
side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale 
trading group in retail which is clearly happening.  This wouldn't of 
happened it they were trading through us.  
	
	

John,

As discussed today, I have attached a summary of ENA's credit exposure to 
Perry Gas Companies, Inc (approximately $1,800,000).  They have filed for 
bankruptcy on August 28, 2000.  It should also be noted that our July 
settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by 
the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit 
exposure.  EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated 
to be over $5,900,000 of additional exposure.  We are working with EES to 
resolve these issues as well.

As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit 
on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.  This company 
was not an approved counterparty and was granted a zero credit line.  

We are still trying to get the list of trades and traders for the July 
transactions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill

Can you make sure that the Toronto Office is not blowing their minds on 
costs.  

	
	

I totally support having a separate marketing and trading team in Ontario to 
focus on the opening of that market.  However, with respect to creating a 
redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch 
function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.  
With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the 
associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly 
trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide 
all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this 
function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously 
be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by 
the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.

From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical 
capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The 
Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, 
however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Your thoughts?

Attached is the data you requested today.   The schematic detail requested 
can be found in the email attachment at the bottom of this email.  Please 
also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and 
trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco 
facilities and staff.

On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik 
(713-853-4764) if you require additional details.

Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick 
relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to 
determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a 
senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and 
quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the 
complexity of dispatching these units. 

If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.

Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av 
equipment.

We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI 
project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO 
to dispatch these units.

We got it covered.  It was my fault.

You should include VP's and also you should make it a little clearer that I 
don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision.

You missed logistics as a rotaion.

Also - Let's leave out where they graduate to.  This might be an issue with 
the AA program if we say that they are going to re-enter the program.

The Zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in Canada.  
They might need to change his Contract to Canadian language but none of the 
terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon 
Canadian $ pay.

So I guess Dave doesn't want to send this out.  

I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% 
of reviews done.  Do you agree.
	
	

Attached, for your information is a matrix reflecting the status of completed 
reviews from the mid-year 2000 process.  This is broken down by ENA

I will provide you with a weekly update on the status.

Please call me at X36628 should you have any questions.

Yes Call me.

Can you get me an updated list of projects by October 9th.

	
	

We have finalized our P&L for Q3.  On the last day of the quarter we had 
about a half dozen deals that were closed that credit still had not given us 
a number for.  We were hit with credit reserves for three deals on the last 
day of the quarter.  These deals were done more than a month ago and credit 
materially changed some of the reserve numbers at the last minute.  We still 
have not received credit numbers from three deals that were done in Q3.  What 
level of service should I expect from credit?

The P&L is not yet done for yesterday.  Our risk group was here until 
midnight.  Our systems were not working right.

Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from 
entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the 
communication problem that currently exists on companies like Perry Gas.  
Please advise.

Any assistance that you can offer is greatly appreciated.

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Richard  
Allan Severude
10/05/2000 06:03 PM
From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

I guess we will just go without a contract.

Stacy White informed me this morning there is discussions on moving all of 
the Power Hedges from the accrual book (approx $100 million loss) into the 
MTM books.  Is this true?

Do I need to be in the loop?

FYI - We successfully bought out of the 2001 supply commitment to OPPD at our 
mark ($4.7 million).  This leaves us with 3 customer deals that I would like 
to set aside as prudency C for East Power (not West Power or gas) for 
calender year 2001.   The 3 deals are MJMUC, VEPCO, and JEA.

Thanks.

If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles"

might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be 
fine. 

I'm okay with this.

I do not run EES trading.  I would contact Marty Sunde with respect to big 
costs that EES wants to spend.  Marty runs EES North America.  I agree with 
you however that they should't go crazy on spending.

John,

Terrell Benke was a summer Associate from the University of Chicago who has 
just accepted Enron's full-time employment offer.  Erik, her husband, 
currently works at Goldman Sachs as a junior trader in Chicago.  Therefore, 
since Terrell will be moving to Houston, Erik is very interested in pursuing

Jean,
Here is my resume. I would like to interview and meet people in natural gas
or electricity.  My sense is that's the best place to start at Enron. You
can reply to this e-mail or reach me at home at 773-667-6740 if you need to
get in touch with me.
Thanks,
Erik

Call me on this I am a little confused.

This crazy.  Sooner or later they will win.  We need to do something radical 
to make them realize they are insane.  I don't know what that is.

So I'm working some magic for Friday.  I think we are going to play a private 
men only club for free (except for caddie fees).  I figure the downside is 
that we get pummled and left for dead.  I'll let you know.

Set  me up on this.

John -

Again,  we are having "big time" systems issues.  While we are having the 
usual length of time issues (a few people were here past midnight last 
night), the issues that occured last night are much more serious than in the 
past.  The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few 
books.  (Positions,  value,  etc.)  Luckily, these errors were all caught 
last night,  but if a less experienced person had been on those books,  it 
could have been a disaster.  (Traders getting incorrect positions and p&l and 
interest rate and credit getting incorrect numbers.)  I have contacted those 
in ERMS that need to be involved,  but I would appreciate it if you could 
provide additional support to this effort.

Thanks,

Jeff

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.

1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.

I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Just to inform you of my thoughts if they are applicable.

MFG
	
	

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.  

MFG

no interest

I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to 
set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

John

Bob 

I talked to Kevin about these two guys and he feels they are critical to our 
business.  Broadband has taken 5 guys out of East Power and left us short. 

Sorry

We should get 9 Million of Prudency tonight.
	
	

We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.

Sounds great.

What if they have there current postions but bigger getting them to their 
limits.  What would the agg var be.

Apparently not eh.

	
	

went down at about 5:06 AM this morning.  did not come up for 1/2 hour.  we 
didn't receive a call from anyone and received little or no information when 
we called the help desk.  we do 2/3 of our volume between 5am and 5:30 am.

I've never heard of them.
Sorry.

I'm sorry but I think its my only child syndrome.

Kevin

I know its tough but your groups need to be involved in recruiting as much as 
possible to keep uplifting the talent in your group.

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

don't you love the ok method of communicating.

Mark and Beth;

Further to our discussions, I have followed up with Beth to talk about 
resources to build the Enron Canada retail business.  She has suggested the 
we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian 
business.  I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came 
recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences 
in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look 
after the product as we build the business.

I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping 
due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with 
the wires and pipes companies.  If Daniel could direct the development out of 
London, that would be great as well.  I heard that he did a great job on the 
Spanish effort.

Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here 
and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this 
business.  I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems 
than trying to build our own from scratch.  I would rather build this without 
looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be 
more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this 
market in time for market opening--just 2 months away.

I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to 
deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you 
guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't 
worry, I will not try any coding myself.

Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London

I thought we should have be taxable to the toon of 100 Million.  Give me a 
call when you get a chance.

let's talk in person

Do you think Janet wants to apply.

Janet 

Call me.

Kyle is working on the PPA.  However, Dave and I told Kyle that unless he can 
get Fastow to sign something that we can walk on the counterparty (in 
otherwords that it is truly non recourse) we are not interested.  

Let me know if we are missing something.

If it was about trading it was "Reminisance of a Stock Operator"

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that 
I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last 
day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  
Please change that if you can.

Do a very short bullet presentation on the key focus for 2001 systems and 
leave lots of time for everyone to grill you (I mean ask questions).

Also Tuesday, Kyle and Eric 1/2 hour.

Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with 
Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take 
agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if 
Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would 
you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects? 
Thanks for your help.

Please be advised that you will need to be at Three Allen Center, 37th Floor 
no later than 12:45 for the Trading Track interviews.  I have attached a 
preliminary schedule for your review.  We will be in the Dover Room at the 
Doubletee for the decision round.  The Dover Room is located on the first 
floor of the Doubletree and you need to be there no later than 5:15 pm.  I 
anticipate we should be finished with the reviews about 6:30 to 7:00 pm.  
Thanks again for all your help.  Ted

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.

I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out 
more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron 
appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely 
well respected in this field.

Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management 
products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for 
pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the 
Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas 
future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 

If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right 
direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,

Michael Fuss

Seems like a fair trade

Lavo.

Kim make sure you brief me about this on Monday,

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the video for the Houston Analyst 
Meeting taking place in January of 2001.  
We have scheduled your shoot for Tuesday, December 5th at  1:00 p.m.  If you 
have any questions in regards to the video content or questions that will be 
addressed, please contact Kathryn Corbally at X34785.  

I can be reached at X36785 if I can be of any further assistance.

Thank you, Laura

Dave give me a call. Some of the data looks odd.

Also It seems that old reports still have Arnolds future contract included.

Some of the traders interviewed Key on Friday and unfortunately he didn't

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

I thought that Jeff Shankman decided not to cancel and to pick up the 
membership costs for that reason when he was in ENA?

Brian

   
	
	

Hello Guys-

As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  
This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online 
database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage 
facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need 
to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep 
the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  
(Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders 
those are VERY critical seconds).

Regards,

Julie  :-)

Julie

I'm looking into this.

Mark

Still waiting for my car keys.

In the package you can include the $11.25 you owe us for interesting movie 
you bought on the 3rd suite in the Lavorato household.

Lavo

Milly it looks like your head of parking and you may need to lease our office 
space too.

No luck yet.  Barnicke is offering the space at less than market but still no 
takers.  Part of the issue is the term and part is the market.

Bruce

I had quite a crazy week.  Give me a call the next time you are in town or if 
you are still in town.  I would love to get together.

Has Dave called you on this or do I need to do something.

I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.

Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the 
futures trades.

Come and see me first thing.  The gas section is way long and complicated.

I would like to request an additional 15 million var for gas.  Prices have 
exploded and I'm working on it.

I don't know why this is coming up now and why we don't address this at year 
end in conjunction with the PRC process.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...
"Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"

Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.

NGX owes us a lot of money on Deceber 25th.  Please send me an  email when we 
receive it.

Thanks 

John 

Dave

I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per 
on the road working on it.  We probable should tell him that we don't have 
anymore unless New Albany is enough.

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit 
reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.

John

That would be outsanding.

Charlene

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well 
with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are 
very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should 
slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  
I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on 
International business.

Regards 

John

Wes

Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas 
Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I 
wonder if some of our other piplelines are members.

Bill.

I've taken a look at your resume and pulled your internal reviews.  We have 
decided to go another route.  Sorry.  I'll be in Houston for the next three 
weeks if you want to talk to me.

Vince where did this resume come from and is he still employed by the 
National Bank in Monteal.

Anthony

Thanks for the email, however, that was the last thing that I received.  I 
think some credit intermediation would be helpful.

not what you are looking for for mid management level we will start over.

We lost 1/2 of the money on our west basis positions.
We lost the other 1/2 on fixed price length.

I have no interest in this person.

The loss was due to rest of month Transco Zone 6 basis.

Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power 
as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an 
emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and 
checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing 
these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.

I thought I was very clear that we are not publishing anything internally 
about California gas prices.

The pain will stop soon.

I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  
Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 
15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to 
eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to 
day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know 

John

Thanks

Despite my veto eBiz decided to publish something on California energy 
prices.  I think Palmer overrulled me.  He said that the article was harmless 
but I still think it is stupid for us to be writing articles about this.

hours a day on VAR.  If yes, talk to Frank.
	
	

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8

Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

I'm a bachelor next week and would love to go to dinner.  Anywhere you want.

Does EES still get to buy PC's for their employees' spouses.  

I guess we are paying for that too.

Did you notice emmissions trading made 6 Million this quarter.  Glad we could 
help.

Stinson Gibner@ECT
12/19/2000 05:55 PM
John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier 
version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls 
and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 
bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 
5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition 
is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the 
position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a 
trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the 
extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back 
when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 
5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses 
vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

--Stinson

Lets grap 5 minutes on this

These assumptions are correct for now.

Give me a call in January on this.

P.S.  Happy Holidays.

FYI

	
	

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with 
Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES 
transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in 
because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with 
CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions 
were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing 
the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for 
them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' 
exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is 
approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue 
and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file 
the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're 
interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with 
TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   
TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; 
however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go 
bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
this.

Try to grab me today on this stuff.

John

Dave

Should we invite Presto and Beldon to this meeting.  I think so.

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no 
roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to 
outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for 
rolling/liquidating positions.

--Stinson

Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap

Stinson Gibner@ECT
12/21/2000 07:36 AM
John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all 
the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.

Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap

Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

--Stinson

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and 
regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff 
rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase 
- not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access 
customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate 
freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers 
to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 
million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive 
CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, 
if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for 
EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend 
the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
 - clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
 - urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the 
"world" to the CA utilities
 - remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of 
hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is 
expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

 - Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will 
assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and    EES will 
assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. 
These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM,    in exchange for 
Avista and MS exposures.
 - PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 
99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable 
from    PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of 
retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
 - addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
 - overall increase in prices
 - incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs 
in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the 
holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
for a long time if not for good.

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the 
state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  
Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority 
of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will 
likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent 
about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

01/22 12:52 UPDATE 1-Enron distances itself from Calif. power crisis 

HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Energy powerhouse Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday 
distanced itself from California's power crisis, saying the turmoil which has 
brought the state's two largest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy would 
not impact its bottom line. 

"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," 
Jeff Skilling, the president and chief operating officer of North America's 
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said in a conference 
call with analysts. 
Skilling also said there hadn't been any significant impact on fourth quarter 
earnings, noting that Enron did not own electricity generation assets in 
California, where rolling electricity blackouts were imposed last week and 
the state's top two utilities are running out of money as they face soaring 
wholesale electricity costs. 

Having sold electricity to the state's main utilities, generating companies 
such as Reliant Energy Inc. <REI.N> and Dynegy Corp. <DYN.N> are now at risk 
of not receiving payments from Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. 
<PCG.N>, and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International 
<EIX.N>. 

At the same time, some have claimed that power generators have taken 
advantage of the crisis by over-charging the state's utilities, which, as 
part of deregulation, cannot pass on skyrocketing electricity prices to 
consumers. 

"California is a much smaller percentage of our overall earnings than some of 
the other energy companies, particularly generators," Skilling said, adding 
that the company only participates in the merchant business of buying and 
selling electricity. 

"The bottom line is this: We are not overexposed in California or anywhere 
else for that matter." 
Shares of Enron rose $2-3/8 to $73-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after 
it reported earnings before nonrecurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 
million in the fourth quarter.

Is there anything in my current role that I won't have to champion.

Billy

We need to hedge funds.
	Caroline Abramo
	01/22/2001 12:18 PM
		
Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas 
options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and 
like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to 
deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like 
dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. 
(???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades 
need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM 
and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so 
its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades 
would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log 
is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

Andy Zipper
01/22/2001 11:15 AM
Now that gas options have been launched how are they being received ? Have 
you been able to convince any funds to trade. I've heard that Tudor is a huge 
player. where do they stand ?

obtain Greg Whalley's approval for all DPR's prior to that date.  Going 
forward, please coordinate with each as to their preferred method of 
designating approval.  I assume you will use e-mail until such time that the 
Executive Reports Viewer can be changed to accomodate this change.  I will 
also assume that you are working on that solution unless otherwise informed.  

John Sherriff/John Lavorato
The memo was exactly as had been sent to you in draft form.  Responsibility 
for LNG continues to be somewhat unclear, however, as it pertains to global 
risk oversight, John Sherriff is officially responsible until further notice.

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. (???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

Now that gas options have been launched how are they being received ? Have you been able to convince any funds to trade. I've heard that Tudor is a huge player. where do they stand ?

Mike,

Tonight John and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.  Please note that John has a laptop computer that is at his home.  I have spoken with Randy about this and he is to be following up with you.  I would like for you to accompany Greg out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his computer.

Also, please note that I gave my and John's passwords to a lady that stopped by my desk today (she is with the migration group).  Could you please confirm for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.

Thanks

Were not hiring him

This week or next week.

OK. So I take it we will let Presto sign this week?
Send me a latest and greatest contract summary.
 
I think that Presto honestly just didn't have time to read his.  Other than him, I consider this process finished and all other outstanding documents expired.
 
When I rework the summary we will sit down and talk about it.

Our IT support will be working through the night to repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will be able to rerun an official book.

Sticking to Motocross eh.

I have a meeting tomorrow.  Can you tell me what total power demand in in the East and the West and what Enron's volumes are.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

I thought we should have be taxable to the toon of 100 Million.  Give me a call when you get a chance.

Do you think Janet wants to apply.

Janet 

Call me.

Kyle is working on the PPA.  However, Dave and I told Kyle that unless he can get Fastow to sign something that we can walk on the counterparty (in otherwords that it is truly non recourse) we are not interested.  

Let me know if we are missing something.

If it was about trading it was "Reminisance of a Stock Operator"

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  Please change that if you can.

That's cheap

Get me the roll off schedule for cnr over the next couple of years.  Canada used to do this for me.

I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely well respected in this field.

Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 

If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,

Brian Redmond@ECT
11/30/2000 10:35 AM
I thought that Jeff Shankman decided not to cancel and to pick up the membership costs for that reason when he was in ENA?

Brian

   

Hello Guys-

As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  (Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders those are VERY critical seconds).

Regards,

Julie  :-)

I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per on the road working on it.  We probable should tell him that we don't have anymore unless New Albany is enough.

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.

John

That would be outsanding.

Charlene

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on International business.

Can take the current spreadsheet attached and add the origination prc resuslts under the proposed cash bonus categy.  The vp commercial page is the only relevant page.  Please send that back when your done. 

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.

*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year for the next five.

We lost 1/2 of the money on our west basis positions.
We lost the other 1/2 on fixed price length.

I have no interest in this person.

Wes is going to tell me in the morning if he is coming with us to Steel Town.

The loss was due to rest of month Transco Zone 6 basis.

If at all possible I would like us to pass on talking publicly about this topic.

Yes

I take it back, I am familiar and I think you guys did a great job getting this done with them.  This is a great first step in our ultimate goal.

For the seven names that were not on the spreadsheet.  Can you fill in all info like the others for them including who they work for and get it back to me promtly.

Thanks 

John'

Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I think this will start our organization to think a little differently and hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

The pain will stop soon.

I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know 

John

Your the King.

Despite my veto eBiz decided to publish something on California energy prices.  I think Palmer overrulled me.  He said that the article was harmless but I still think it is stupid for us to be writing articles about this.

John
This is the last eBiz issue for 2000!  Read more about Ken and Jeff's big announcement.

Also in this issue:

Can we take one of your wonderchildren in fundementals and let them spend 1-2 hours a day on VAR.  If yes, talk to Frank.

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas desk VaR dropped to $3.8

Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

No interest

We can adjust the salary if he get promoted.  Leave it for now.

Does EES still get to buy PC's for their employees' spouses.  

I guess we are paying for that too.

Did you notice emmissions trading made 6 Million this quarter.  Glad we could help.

Stinson

Thanks

P.S.  

At the end of the term of each simulation do we assume that we close the position on that date and take a hit or do we leave the simulation with an open positon.

John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

--Stinson

P.S.  Happy Holidays.

FYI

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through this.

Try to grab me today on this stuff.

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for rolling/liquidating positions.

--Stinson

Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap
   

Stinson Gibner@ECT

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.

Normal Roll	No Roll		Fill Gap

   

Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

--Stinson

What's up with Manu.  Janet keeps sending me e-mails threatening my life if I don't get an option trader. 

When I meet with Orlando and Joe on Thursday, see if Rebecca McDonald can be present.

I booked a flight on Continental to San Francisco.
 
March 15th  - Thursday - I arrive at 4:47.
March 18th - Sunday - I arrive back in Houston at 6:05
 
I think Tych is already in California.  If we can all get there at similar times we can get in our Cadillac and go. 

Dave have we moved research, legal etc. to report directly into Greg and Mark.

I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
 
Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.
 
John
 
P.S.  Sorry for the confusion.
 

Although I haven't heard from Dave I'm trying to change my flights to March 8 - 11.

Rob

I'm very pleased about Petro.

Can send me the e-mail with the details.  I will forward it to the really big kids down here for you.

Derek

Your in on Pebble if you want.

Lavo.

yes

Are you okay with this?

Yes he is.  In addition, Kathy Kelly and Dayem Khandker, who are on the Wellhead Desk, should be empowered to transact on Enron Online.  Please contact John Grass if you have any further questions.

Jean

Is John Grass the "wellhead" book?

Frank

if he is the wellhead book

John, 
Is John Grass an authorized trader?  It appears that he has been granted authority to trade on EOL and I don't recognize him as having such authority. 

Let me know.

Frank

The east power traders have agreed to post their two ways on EOL for EES.  Janet, you might want to help speed up the administrative process.  It should be minimal effort.

Do we need any help on the Ontario front from Lay or Skilling.

Given the size of the stakes, I could definately justify their time.

Your Pan Nat summary was not clear enough to pass on to my supervisors.  Can you simplify it a little more.

Thanks

Lavo

Rob

I'm going to get on Ken Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).  I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.  I'm concerned that hoards of people from Houston will show up and that it will be a cluster.  Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.  Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my Ken meeting.  Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized.

Chris

On the California deal.

Can we possibly get the right to kill the deal 6 months from now if they do not get some credit support.  We may not exercise the option anyway, however, it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free.

When is the Gas Daily meeting.  I would like to attend.  I think I could help with the pitch.

Wes

I'm away Monday and Tuesday in Brazil.  I thought I would give you things that I'm waiting on or that we should meet about next week.

1.  Your group was going to give back the assets/balance sheet stuff in 3 formats.

2.  On South America - Lot's of stuff but we'll talk when I get back.  Most importantly that I get an income statement that looks like North America.

		-  They did a trade with me that's up 8 Million for them. This is fine but the negative p/l was not showing up in N.A.  The positive p/l was showing up in South America. (We should make sure this trade does not get cash settled.  The last thing I want is Cash going to S.A. on an internal trade.

		
3.  Cross Commodity Book. - I have 1.9 Million of losses that were last year that they found in January.  Put this in the TBG line and change the line name to Other .  In the Footnotes we will explain all others.  I'm sure there is a million things to come.

4.  We also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me.

5.  I've set up a meeting with you,me,Deffner and Louise on this 15% capital charge.  We should come up with another methodology.

That's all I can think of now.

John  

Has an agreement been reached between South America and North America on the Turbine.  Or is North America waiting for final approval of its power plant

What happened to Dona Francisca.

Mark

You still own me you expected values for Pan Nat.

I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.

Wes

With respect to the PPA reserve.

We need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.

Lavo

Dave

I thought we were hiring 1 person from EBS not two.

William Abler was ranked as a strong director.  I will agree, but I hope the quality is as high as you think.  We are going to get tones of resumes from EES and EBS, if your going to blow all you bullets upfront, make sure your getting great people.

Some guy at Duke told Mark Frevert today that on March 15th, Duke won a court ruling saying that they expanded the scope of the PanNat Arbitration.

True?

Mark

We get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for PAN NAT.  Although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to Duke that they had no support for their position.  We would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers.  
As we understand it arbitration starts July 1.  I'll talk to you more next week.  If you want an update prior call Richard Sanders.

John                                                                                                                                

Can I get an updated contract status report.

As you would say.  There is good news and bad news.
 
The good - we got the dining room chair.
 
The bad - it was an end/arm chair not a side chair.  Specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms.

I think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units.  I think this is a waste of time.  We can include them in our business unit PRC's for Managers and Directors.

first i heard about this.

John,
I heard that the traders are required to put together supporting documentation for large trades, outlining fundamentals and market assumptions.  Is this true? And if possible, any chance I could review the files?  I'm thinking we/RAC can add value by perhaps "balancing" out analysis and maybe even suggest a way to optimize the process by periodically backtesting analytical assumptions.  (e.g. Are we making money because are analysis was correct, or are there "new" features driving the market.) 

Frank

Let's just leave the prudency stuff unhedged for now.

Can we get more critical mass.  Our Portland guys, ie Wolfe, might have some Montana counterparts.

John,

I've been approached by a couple of loads in Montana totalling 50-75 MWs.  Zufferli and I did some rough math on the costs of transmission and what our implied offer would be and haven't heard back from the counterparties.  I think that you need more critical mass to make a project work.

Derek
Derek
 
Fed Ex the PPA sales pitch to me.
 
Also, I read in the newspaper that Montana was tight for power.  I couldn't tell wether they are tight or the price is just high.  Can we sell long term power to a counterparty or two or three in Montana and build a line?
 
John

Jeff
 
I went home today sick.  But I'll try in the future.

Come on.  You should come to the tuesday traders' meeting.  they've been really good. In 3321 4-5 each tuesday.

I'll bring over a copy of the current book we are reading as enticement.  It's not a corvette, but it's a good book.

Your continuing to kill me.  Is that how you spell continuing.

Jeanie,

Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.

Phillip

Yes

Are you free for drinks either Monday or Wednesday?

Thanks

John

Can the full Day end at 7.

John--
Assuming you get the o.k. on the work arrangement we discussed yesterday........

As a follow up to our discussions, particularly concerning working the second half of the day once each week, here is what I would propose:  Instead of working 4 half days in the morning and one half day in the afternoon/evening, I would work 3 half days in the morning (8-1) and one full day.  This way I would be available to meet with Geoff in the afternoon once each week.

Please let me know if this works and if the arrangement in general is acceptable to HR, Louise, etc.  Thanks.

oh god is there an agenda.
 
Would dinner Thursday work instead.
 
 

 

No

John,

What's your view. Should we consider doing something more for Todd? I think Jeff would like to pay him or grant him some more equity. I am on the fence. When I mentioned it to Deliainey a week or two ago he said no then said I should discuss with you.

David:

With regard to Todd Busby - some clarification.  His total bonus was $75,000 - of which he appears to have decided to take 20% in equity.  The last numbers I heard before bonuses went final were a total bonus of $100K consisting of $75K in cash and $25K in equity.  This $100K bonus was agreed to without the knowledge that his contract called for $150K if he was in the top two groups.

The above is really just to remind you to continue reflecting on whether it would be feasible to do anything for Todd.

Jeff

I was in S.A. until this morning.  I need sleep tonight.  We'll get it done.

dinner this week?  i'm free mon-wed

PS.  Joe, can you pick my team with the cheesie in the toe thing?  It sounds like a winner.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Chris;

Do you see what you can come up with when you put your mind to it! Great
idea, but I had this routine planned out whereby I show up last at McConvey'
s, and whilst everyone is busy choosing, I remove my shoes and socks and
very slowly, insert a large cheesie between each of my toes. I then stand
up, lift each pant leg about 4 or 5 inches, and proceed to walk around Rhode
Island's white carpet on my heels only, therefore attempting to keep orange
crumbs off his rug. I would make my picks in this fashion, bringing me good
Kharma.

I'm in if everyone wants to go this way.

Joe.

Leave for Vegas Thursday Afternoon, April 26th.  Come Back Sunday April 29th.

John, not going to be able to make the Barton creek trip; however, the Vegas trip would be fun ... I will check into planes.  What did you have in mind as far as specific times and dates?

Regards
Dave
Recession, What Recession.

Barton Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and Donna want to join us feel free.  

The next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.  Let me know your thoughts.

to exact revenge for past pools has arrived.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

I wish I could help.

To add an element of fun to tonight's hockey,  whomever is going against Brad should "team up" and make a concerted effort to  NOT allow him to carry the puck over the blue line. If two or three guys "rush"  him, he will be forced to "dish the puck" off to a teammate, which he HATES to  do on a rush. He is not happy unless he either shoots or makes a sleek,  goal-mouth pass. His natural arrogance will force him to try to beat all those  who challenge him. If you check him or he makes a bad pass, he gets furious and  is LOTS of fun to watch.
 
I, for one, am changing teams tonight just to do  this . If I succeed only once, it will have been well worth it!
 
REGARDS,
 
Joe.

i'm not sure

Hi John,
Are you okay with combining the Retail line and Executive line for Canada?

I am currently looking at reconciling Canada's P&L numbers for Q1 and Q2 to the ENA Earnings Estimate for Q1 & Q2 for 2001.  Could you let me know who is responsible for generating the total margin, direct & operating expenses and capital charge numbers for Canada in the ENA Earnings Estimate file?  In addition, can you please combine the Retail (Milnthorp) and Executive (Milnthorp) rows together on the Q1 and Q2 Earnings Estimate as the Retail division no longer exists in Canada?  

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Grant

Goal :  Fun in 2001

Dave,

Greg is requesting Enron Americas' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more than 3 to 4 each) asap.

Many Thanks,

First of all - blow me.

Second, my wife is expecting in early November so I might be able to slip away in September.  I would vote for anything that would require one flight from Houston.  I'm sure Rich would agree.  ie.  Timmins would be tough.  I would love to join you all and get mocked for an entire weekend.

Lav

or Lavo as the hacks down here call me.

As anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.
 
I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.
 
Regardless, our American friends have yet to pony  in, nor has Galea ll, and I want my clams immediately! McConvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer's address below, I do not want you having  access to my home address.
 
On as totally separate note, I'm beginning to now  look past when my son Yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. As such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late September? I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!! Air Canada is  offering $235 flights to Norfolk and Charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!!
 
So the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , I hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you're about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! Are you ready Charles? (" If he's in, I'm OUT!)".  Hey McConvey, are you going live a little outside that Weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere?
 
Let the witchypooing begin. I'll explain that to  you later Lav.

What bid would you show me to take the price risk and capital charge on these units.

John
John:

Fred Mitro and I just got off the phone with Duncan Croasdale at Enron Canada regarding the 11N1s. He indicated that, although nothing has been signed yet, that they are working on several leads. Steve Thome (he works for Calger) is also pursuing a lead on these units with Montana Power.

Duncan advised me and Fred that the units are on Canada's books for US$38 million, and the asking price is US$39.5 million.

I am happy to take these units on as you requested. Fred Mitro and Chris Booth in my group, who also worked on the successful LM6000 sales and pending GE7EA and SW501D5A sales, can be made available to work on a sale of these units. In my conversation with Duncan, however, he indicated his group wants us to instead help to provide customer leads which we would turn over to them. We can certainly do this as an alternative to taking the units on directly.

Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.

Regards,

Ben

Friday is the day when we are supposed to close the Alamac sale to AIG Highstar.  Should we fail to close this transaction, we should look to our potential alternatives for withdrawing from the fund, unless of course we view that we will close but it will happen over the few days following.    Interestingly, AIG may be planning to use further funds raised to create a second fund rather than add to the current fund leaving us with more of a percentage ownership but less capability of accessing the deals (fuel supply, despatch and EPC rights would not be attached to any second fund).

We also have far too many people talking to AIG now and we need to stop this immediately, going forward only Joe Deffner should communicate with Bob as at the moment we have too many people doing all of the work for AIG for no return.  As of Friday or the close of Alamac - Bob can only talk through Joe.  We are not in the business of doing work for this fund.

Can you put together (only if we fail to close) a short review for John of why we should stay in the fund over removing ourselves.  I recognize that contractually we have no capability of exiting at this point but I know you think differently and I hope you are right.  My view is that we need to get out as we have no control over their investments.  I have spoken to Brian Stanley on this fund and Brian is (unless someone in his group has a reason not to)  happy to follow whatever approach we take particularly as EE&CC is no longer a EPC company.

Send me a cleaner summary of your curve on 1/17/200.  All I want is a the curve by year - peak/off peak and total.

David,
Per my voicemail, the Associate and Analyst Program is currently looking for additional Director level Analyst PRC Representatives.  The breakdown that is needed is as follows:

1 - Enron Americas
1 - EIM
2 - EGM

Your previous nominations made at the end of the year will be used which will helps to reduce the number of Analysts for each Representative to ten.  However, we need more Representatives.  Again, we are looking for the Directors that are considered to be the up and comers in these business units.  The Analysts that will depend on them need to know that they are people who are willing to take on this responsibility and represent them fairly.  

We would like to have your new nominations by March 1st so we may begin communicating to the new Analyst PRC Representative Board.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks so much.

Great!!!!

John, we closed our first management services arrangement with a royalty trust - ARC Resources (~60mm/d) for a 2 year term. For your information, Eric and Cyntia have been aggressively targeting the Royalty Trust Co.'s as they should be a perfect fit re reducing/fixing G&A, back-office costs, etc.

I am of the opinion it will close Wednesday. Legal teams meeting tomorrow for final review. Municipal Resolution received and accepted by our legal today. Bank transfers being set up tomorrow for Wednesday 2 pm. But we have been here before. Will advise.  

MFG

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

Per your request here are the documents you might need regarding Arcor. This was what Dave reviewed last with the exception of the latest currency forwards.

Short Story Version:	Plant close pending Monday February 12th
			Need Skilling's approval because most recent revisions to the dash incorporated a new market view of Argentina devaluation risk 				lowered the Project IRR below RAC Capital Price 18.92% vs 21.88%.
			Additional $800,000 not in the dash from true up structure and major maintenance savings.
			Currency forwards significantly down since the project was reviewed in December due to 40 Billion IMF Argentine package
			Low cost commercial platform to build from $180 per KW
			Liquid market to resell asset due to pending utility privatization in Cordoba

Please let me know if you have any questions I am in town until Thursday afternoon.

We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing - within Enron Americas. The Asset Marketing group will have responsibility for the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas. Joining Don's group will be Stuart Zisman.  Stuart was formerly in ENA Legal, having most recently worked on the sale of ENA's peaker plants with Don.

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart in their new roles.

Please get someone to deal with this.

We have had 100 percent turnover in our risk group in the last 9 months, including two people leaving in the last week.  One of the main frustrations comes from many overtime hours spent working through technology issues.  

Last Friday is a typical example.  The three members of our risk group were here until about 10 PM Friday night working through a problem caused by Technology.  For some reason, our Futures position was dropping out of our positions.  They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.

It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.  What do you think we can do to change this situation?

Sources have conducted the following "off-the-record" interview with a BC Hydro executive.  

Executive Summary
BC Hydro projected capacity 
BC Hydro/Liberal Government's export policy
BC Hydro expanded capacity projects

BC Hydro Capacity
The individual stated that BC Hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply British Colombia through 2005, even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion.  He stated that BC Hydro's long-term contracts to supply power to the grid in the Western US amounted to only 1% of BC Hydro's capacity.  Therefore, the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through Powerex, the company's "main revenue generator."  For example, according to a company report, BC Hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $2.876 billion Canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001, largely due to spot market trading.

BC Hydro Exports
BC Hydro feels the new Liberal government likely will "make a concerted effort to expand capacity" in British Colombia. Likewise, since the Liberal government will be "business-oriented," the BC Hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the US.  However, the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point, as "people don't necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export."  This is due to broad-based environmental opposition to building more plants.  Therefore, in the long-term BC Hydro's new projects will favor "green alternatives" such as dam expansion and biomass, thermal and solar plants over gas-fired plants.

The spokesman stated that the Liberal Party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove BC Hydro's monopoly on power.  If and when this happens, relations between the company and the government are expected to "quickly sour."

BC Hydro Capacity Projects
BC Hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand/improve generation capacity, including:
Seven-Mile Dam -- BC Hydro will likely add a 213 MW turbine to the 3 units already in place
Revelstoke Dam -- BC Hydro is "looking very seriously" at adding a 500 MW unit to the 4 units already in place.  There is also the potential to add a 5th 500 MW unit, though this is not being considered at this time.
Site C Dam -- A plan for a 960 MW dam was shelved in the 1980s due to environmental concerns, but now appears to once again be a "viable option." Though BC Hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time, the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980s, and that resurrecting the plan would be a BC Hydro decision.
Burrard Thermal Plant - BC Hydro has invested $250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions.

Calpine has bought a 240 MW gas-fired co-generation plant called Campbell River on Vancouver Island.  This plant is "in the final stages of testing and is already generating."  Calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "in the next few weeks."  BC Hydro will buy power from the plant for use on Vancouver Island. This is part of a plan to make Vancouver Island self-sufficient in electricity.  Another "key plank" in this plan is the Port Alberni plant, a 250 MW, independently-owned plant that is being sold to BC Hydro.  The plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply Vancouver Island.

John,

I was speaking to Barry Tycholiz about a week ago and he was telling me about your BMW.  If you're still interested in selling it, I'd like to take a look.  

Thanks,

Dan Diamond

Great!!!

Following up our conversation - 

 - Garrett and Dana are in constant contact re British Energy and have no issues with extending the contract 
 - Paul and his team are "very confident" that they can roll the hedges and maintain the existing margin
 - They are 100% confident that they can hedge all 500MW's at say a $2 margin
 - Their plan is to hedge at least 400MW between now and november (new deals + rollovers)
 - We will continue to update both you and Dana before entering into any hedges

Were you a guest speaker?

Spring is finally here -- there are a lot of things to do.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,

John

Boy does this sound like something that would get fucked up.  Start with Paul Devries in Toronto and let me know what happens.  I didn't even know it was closing.

John,

We will have a substantial multi-year C$ short when our mill closes.  We're looking at about C$100mm in 01 and $300/yr thereafter.  I understand ENA may have an opposite position.  Could we discuss this? or would you refer me to one of your myriad of underlings?  I would like to keep EGM out of our pockets if possible.

John:

I have a friend, Matt Whittaker,  that has a small power plant construction company.  They specialise in fast track projects using used turbines.  A small niche, but he has made some decent money doing it.  He asked me a few days ago if Enron would have any interest in a very small 35-40 MW project in California for a cement plant.  According to him, the cement plant is owned by Hanson plc and they have a site that has been permitted by the local air quality board for a used turbine that he has located and can have up and running by summer.  What he says they want is someone like Enron to develop the inside the fence plant and help them capture any upside from a potential expansion of the facility. (apparently the site is capable of supporting a larger facility, but that requires further permitting.)

I have done no independent verification of this and it may not be real, but thought you might be interested.  If so, Matt can be reached at 713-660-7171 office or 713-823-7222 cell.  Have whoever calls reference me.  If you are not interested, just let me know and I will tell him its of no interest.  If someone calls, please ask them to drop me an email so I can act like I know who they are if Matt brings it up.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

I'm not sure Milly can escape this.  

John
John/Dave, in reviewing the 2001 plan, I have been trying to understand the capital charge portion. In discussions with Laynie East, our Accounting contact, the capital charge represents the cost of capital for investments funded by ENA Houston. 

I have since investigated each of ECC's balance sheet items and each has been funded by ECC - not ENA Houston. Based on this, Laynie is in agreement that the capital charge on the 2001 plan for ECC should be nil.

Please let me know if you are also in agreement or have further questions.

A winner found north of border: Canadian firm cashes in on California ills

By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 4, 2001)

VANCOUVER, British Columbia  --  The room doesn't look like much: a bank of computer screens flickering quietly, a group of youthful-looking employees swappping jokes or finishing odd chores. The only noteworthy feature is the small electronic tote board in the middle of the room flashing the going rate in U.S. dollars  --  $175 to $200 a megawatt hour  --  for electricity in the Western United States.

Perched on the 14th floor of a downtown Vancouver office tower, the room is the nerve center of a phenomenally successful energy trading empire, a company that's raked in hundreds of millions of dollars by selling electricity to California and neighboring states in recent months.

The company is Powerex Corp., the wholesale trading arm of British Columbia's government-owned electric utility, BC Hydro. Thanks to Powerex's adroit, well-timed buying and selling of electricity, BC Hydro's profits have nearly tripled in the past nine months to about $862 million in U.S. dollars, from $303 million a year earlier.

Set up a time to go through Pastoria with me.

Today we entered into an agreement with CDWR.  A condition of any new deal was payment for power deliveries already made.  We received $500M earlier this week and $10.9MM today (this $10.9MM was not technically due until March).  Based on those payments, we executed a confirm and EEI with the following terms:

EPMI Sells
CDWR Buys
200MW
Peak
NP-15 
Feb 24-Mar 31
Price: $265 
Payment: Every 7 Days starting Mar 2

CDWR gave EPMI the option (exercisable up to Mar 28, 2001) to extend this deal through March 30, 2006 at a price of $127 (price is retroactive to Feb 23,2001 so if we exercise, we credit CDWR for the difference).   This option enables us to try to work out the credit issues with CDWR.   

This is a very valuable contract if we can get comfortable with the credit so I will continue to work on it.  I will also pursue discussions with them with respect to Pastoria, but I believe we may want to make a decision with Calpine in early March (which might be before we can ink a creditworthy deal with DWR).

Chris

Can we sell them Pastoria or do we have to sell them the power from us.

Gentlemen:

I have spoken with CDWR several times since we submitted our proposal.  They are immediately interested in a 5 year power sale and then want to discuss Pastoria.  I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year ($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start trading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow, but so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear from them again later today.  I will keep you posted.

Regards,

Chris

Working you.

John, I'm trying to close these employment contracts this week - you wanted me to talk to Chad. Can you give me some parameters on s/b and equity.

John & Louise -

To follow up on our previous meeting regarding the coal initiative, I've attached a brief description of the approach going forward, including some first-cut proforma results.  Our goal over the next month is to more fully vet the cost and operations numbers in the attached and to nail down probable sites.

In mid-April, after we've more fully vetted the costs, we'll route our detailed proforma.

After reviewing, let me know if you have questions or want to discuss further.

I'm prettry pumped about losing 13

The gas desk lost $13MM. West desk made $56MM, financial desk lost $45MM.

Our Copel shares are falling in value.  We have never marked this investment even though it is public.  We currently own ADR's - ELP is the ticker.  We are restricted (i think) in selling until July.  At the current price we would lose 15 to 30 Million.  
Copel is trading at $6.70, down over $1.00 from Thursday close. The rumor is that this is the aftershock of a 7 MM block trade last week.	

YOUR CALL, JUST DO IT QUICK

John,

Should we request in the DASH to sell 1,270,000 shares or the whole block of 14,173,600 in one shot? Vlady

Is the Geresul contract done.

Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.

We don't need the currency or mmbtu/gj conversion language if Gas Daily agrees to what we want.

This is the language we have to start swapping EOL products vs. Gas Daily.  The next set is to get this language as an alternative to select when setting up products.  Please let me know if you think we need to make any changes.

From the Gas and Power side, we wouldn't need any traders in Montreal, but perhaps some marketers.

Paul Devries in Toronto runs our Eastern Canada operation if you would like to talk to him.

John

John,
I haven't spoken to you in a while and trust that your off to another strong year and that your family is well settled in Houston.  As you may have heard, I have spent the last year in Japan with Global Mkts trying to help kickstart an fx and interest rate trading operation that would tie this region into our global operation. 

Something has arisen personally and wanted to ask you in confidence of any potential opportunities that you may be aware of in Canada for a trading and/or origination role, perhaps in the next 2-5 months time.  My wife is keen to relocate near her family in Montreal, and so ideally I am wondering if you are aware of any needs that Rob Milnthorp, David Delainey, or yourself may have in that area, be it in metals, power, gas etc. I am aware of a satellite metals office in Montreal under a Director named Jean Michaud, as well as the recent Quebec City paper mill acquisition but am not aware of any other activities which we are involved with in that region. 

Thanks for your time, John

Sincerely,
Darren

- No significant change in margin or hotlist summary

Las Vegas:  Allegheny, Black Hills, Northland Power are on dealbench reviewing data, info memo and purchase and sale agreement.  
Process: review docs and data, visit site, negotiate purchase and sale - still on track for June 30 signing and August 31 funding.

Roseville: Exercised option for $6MM of ERC's from Georgia Pacific.  Working on development agreement and initial CEC application.

AMPS: Last week received complete emissions data on units.  Pursuing deals to install, sell or lease first 2 units.  Most likely structure: Site owner contributes site and pays 20% of costs and get 20% of margin associated with selling energy into merchant market.  Currently in discussion with 6 industrials and 8 utilities.  Oregon Steel is in the lead - they are spending $ on permitting and engineering at their site in Portland (unfortunately the site is near my house so I may protest!).

Blue Dog: $3.5MM of income recognition for turbine sale has moved to Q2 from Q3.

Tolls to Generators: Reliant did not lift our 100MW Mid-C offer. but they are still working on it - they had VAR constraints.  We are also showing synthetic tolls to other generators that expressed interest in our LV toll:  Duke, Constellation, Cinergy, NRG, Dynegy and Allegheny.  While these companies lead with assets, they also have trading functions that seem willing to get long through a PPA.

DWR: Still working through credit and financial info.  Their bid is still there and in the money, but has fallen $2-$3/MWh due to the falling prices in the west.   

Maybe you can have a diesal position.  If you can justify it to me and Rick Buy.  Talk to Shankman and see who in his organization runs that product.

with all of the diesel generation going into the west for this summer, should we buy some diesel?  who runs that book?  can the west desk carry a diesel position?

I'm not sure that we have enough candidates to bother.

John,

To ensure a consistent approach with the previous trading track interviews, we will shcedule a dinner the night before the interviews (Tuesday, 29th May).      Your entire Interview/Management Team will be invited (24 people).

I trust that you are available/happy for us to proceed on this.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.

Dear John,
 
You do not know me, but I got your contact details  from Bruce Angus who I know from Kellogg as we both graduated in  1994.
 
The reason for this email is that I am very  interested in working in a management or business development position at Enron  Broadband Services in London. At the moment a headhunter is supposedly setting  up an appointment with Enron for me, but I believe it would be extremely useful  to approach you as well to speed up the process. Therefore I would really appreciate it if you could forward my details to  one of your colleagues in the US or the UK.
 
For your information please note that if you have a  look at my CV, you will see that my last two jobs were quite short. When I  joined eos internet ventures I knew I was taking a substantial risk, but  believed there was an opportunity due to the strong management, but  unfortunately we were not able to raise 2nd round funding. United Internet AG is  a German publicly traded company with 3000 employees and revenues of Euro 200  million. The Board decided to change the international strategy during my first  month of employment and offered me the temporary job (but minimum of 9 months)  of Head of Investor Relations for United Internet AG in Germany. I declined as I  was hired as MD in the UK and not Head of IR in Germany. In addition, I am  (still) happily married so I didn't want to travel between the 2 countries  for such a long time.
 
Anyway, it would be fantastic if you could help me  in any way and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me or  let me know if and when I can contact you.
 
Best wishes,

Do you want to see him again ?

Neil

	I had a great visit with Eddie Rietze last night.  We spent about 3 hours together.  I think we should definately pursue him.
He is interested talking further.  We will probably need to meet with him during the evening.  Please let me know if I need to do 
anything to proceed.  I indicated to Eddie that you would be contacting him to set an interview schedule.

We should have room on 6.  Check and see if Arnold has redone the floor plan.  You need to keep this away from Fred's group.  I would suggest locating near Gas Structuring.  Ed McMichael, the head of gas structuring can be a big help.

John -

What are your thought s on location of EES' Gas desk - current head count = 47.  FYI, we just assigned Jim Homco to this group to address commercial and operational issues.

Is there any space on 6 with ENA's Gas desk?  We have had discussions lately re: the many areas where potential integration efficiencies could be achieved, such as having a retail fixed price rep sit on Lagrosta's desk to achieve more timely and accurate prices for non-swap products.

We could fit the group on 5, but the functional benefit just isn't there.

Also, does Sally Beck's group provide the confirms/contract/risk services for ENA's gas desk as it does for ENA Power?  If so, shouldn't Sally be involved in retail?  These guys are really behind in this respect and it is a big factor in ongoing losses and commercial imperfections.

talk to Don on the EES stuff

John,

Does anyone report to you the EES-CAL positions? As of this morning, that book was screwed up, for example, it included the Nepool positions. Is P&L of $20.5 MM as of 1/30 correct? Also, no VaR is reported on these positions as of this morning.

I am going to try to clean this mess up today.

Vlady.

It's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var.  I have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field.  On our other issue, I working on getting something in front of you this week.

I understand that there was a new EPNG transport booked yesterday but that you did not want any option value booked.  Could you let me know your thoughts on this?  Is this a revenue management issue or do you still have fundamental concerns with the option value concept?

ok

John,  We finished the presentation for discussion.  I suggest we review during our Thursday meeting.  

ok

John:

We executed the transmission connection contract with Light (local distribution company) yesterday for the project.  Based on completing this agreement and our conversation, we are moving forward with the shipment of the turbines.  Initial loading of loose items will start this afternoon and turbines tomorrow with a planned departure of the ship on Sunday.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments?

Thanks,
Brett

Kim can you set up a phone interview with this guy next week.
 
Mr. Lavorato:
 
I was given your name by Brian Edgeworth as a  possible contact for employment opportunities with Enron.  I was part of  Goldman Sachs C$ fixed income effort for four (4) years.  Goldman recently  decided to exit this business entirely.  I was involved in a  trading/capital markets role in both C$ corporate bonds and securitized  products.  I am interested in Enron because I believe it to be one of the  "smarter"  organizations out there.  I am flexible in terms of  location.  I have attached a copy of my resume for your  perusal.
 
I thank you in advance for your time and consideration.   I can be reached either via the phone number below or by replying to this  email.  I will attempt to contact you in the next couple  of days to confirm your receipt of this email.

those were all 250

Just use mids on the day they were pulled.

John, 

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

We are also making sure that there will be no adverse tax impact for Enron.

Please let me know if you agree to close these positions.

Assuming this P/L is going to stay at 0, get the line item off the DPR.

 << File: ena cal deals as of 2-7.xls >> 

Just go ahead and talk to Dave about the other industries.

John,

I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.

EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:

Mining
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Fertilizer Industry
Rail Transportation

In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added

In discussions with the different regions:

ENA should add: 
Refining 
Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
Meat Processing - Luce
Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)

Let me know if there is anything else I should do.

Chris

My thoughts are the same.  You should stay in Canterra.  We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.  Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.

Lavo

John, I want to re-confirm your approval to enter into a new lease. We need to give notice to Canterra by end of June on whether we are extending for an additional 3 years to June 2005 or terminating our lease June 2002. 

I'm currently negotiating on 3 different sites as well as discussing the extension with Oxford:

Canterra		3 year lease - no renewal rights - $26sq/ft at 20,000 sq. ft. No ability to expand contiguously. Currently, at capacity.

TCPL Tower		Conoco has 3 floors (26,27,28 at 25,000 sq.ft/floor). With Gulf takeover, they will consolidate into Gulf Square. Looking for 3 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft 10 year lease w/renewal rights. Good floor-plate (column-free rectangle). One floor would likely be 			adequate for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Bankers Hall		Calpine has 2 floors (39,40 at 19,000 sq.ft/floor). With Encal takeover, they will consolidate into Canada Trust. Looking for 2 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft. 10 year lease w/renewal rights. One floor would be less than adequate - 2 floors would be more 				than we need for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Phillips Warehouse	2 floor warehouse being converted to 3 floor office bldg. 10 year lease w/renewal rights on 35,000 sq.ft at $20sq/ft. Will build to suit and 			Enron would have building naming rights. Timing with expiry of Canterra lease is good (Occupy date would be 1st qtr, 2002). 

My preference is to target the Phillip's brothers warehouse.Timing, location, price, sq.footage, parking all look good. They are willing to deal with us exclusively and have aspirations of designing a state-of-the-art office building (this is consistent with their reputation) while Calpine/Conoco want to free-option us while they look for multi-floor tenants (much like what happened when we made an offer on TCPL tower previously and they used it to lever Hunt Oil into a mulit-floor lease).  

Let me know your thoughts on this as I need to move fairly quickly.

John, first off, congrats on your promotion! 

You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year. 

The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.

Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors. 

The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation. 

We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

Please let me know whether we should proceed in negotiating a lease with TCPL.

Regards
Milnthorp

Fun Fun Fun

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

What happened to the new trader graphs.

John,

Further to our meeting the other day, my guys have determined the following:

1) Approximately 2% of all non-Nymex natural gas transactions are completed after 2:30 pm.

2) Approximately 10% of all Nymex natural gas transactions are completed after 2:30 pm

3) As of Jan. 23, we have completed 113 gas and 112 power transactions on ICE.

4) As of Jan. 23, we have completed 139 gas and 72 Power transactions on Dynegy Direct.

Dave

Liquidity feeds on itself.  PJM Cinergy and Entergy were not liquid until we made them liquid.

No to be overly defensive, but in very liquid markets (ie PJM, Cinergy and Entergy) the EOL bid/offer is 2.5-3.5%.  In the west MidC, NP,SP, the bid offer is 3-4.5%.  In a market it which I am 95% of the trades with no liquidity without me, my EOL bid offer is 4-5%.  I think the is very reasonable, if I felt that being tighter would allow more trades without me either being the repository of unwanted MW or being the only supplier of MW, then I would be tighter.

You need to arrage this yourself.  The key is that the top companies on this list who don't trade with us neeed to.

Lavo

John, I took a look at that report last night.  You are correct. I do not receive that report today but would like to receive it if possible.  

Thanks and I will return this copy to you.  BT

This goes in the second coverless binder we created.  Get you not me on the distribution list.
Attached is an updated EWS Litigation Status Report.

 

I'm confused by this one. Who in ENA is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.

The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

Did you know that the Extrinsic value of the Northern Border Trasport from Ventura to Chicago has increase from 4.7 Million to 
7 Million over two months.  

Lavo
John Lavorato expressed concern last week that we may be falling into the same trap again regarding the extrinsic value in our transportation books.  I prepared a spreadsheet summarizing the EXTRINSIC VALUE ONLY (in total and $/MMBtu) that were in each of the books as of 12/5/00, 1/2/01 and 2/1/01.  Hopefully this will provide you with the information necessary to determine if this is, in fact, happening    Please note the following facts::

CENTRAL:
* The NB Ventura to Chicago capacity's extrinsic value has increased signficantly both in total dollars and in $/MMBtu.  This may need review.  
* Note that, although the ANR & NGPL capacities to Consumers have decreased in total dollar extrinsic value, the $/MMBtu value is very high.  This may need review.
* The new capacity--NGPL Midcon to Chicago has an extremely high $/MMBtu value--$.2227/MMBtu.  This may need review.

WEST:
* The West added two new deals--the extrinsic value is so minimal there is no impact here.
* There were 3 capacity deals that, in December, had no extrinsic value--they have all increased in value but they appear to be properly valued now.
* The PGT capacity was sold, obviously showing no extrinsic value any longer.
* The EPNG Perm to Valero capacity decreased in value, both in total extrinsic dollars and $/MMBtu.

EAST:
* All capacity from Rayne to Leach decreased in total extrinsic dollar value, but the $/MMBtu increased on all except the longest term Rayne to Leach deal.
* All capacity from Onshore to Rayne increased in total dollar value, both in total and $/MMBtu.
       The net impact of these two changes was a net increase of approximately $267,000, but $/MMBtu mostly saw net increases.  
* A new transaction on Tennessee accounted for the other $266,000 in extrinsic dollar value increase.

a natural gas transportation infrastructure, scheduled for May 24th.

 - pl01-4.000.doc=20

Call me about the dynegy thing I have an idea.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

I would like to talk about Dana.  Can you a Oxley recommend a contract to me.  Do not mention it to Dana.

Just a second  note to follow up on whether you have decided to renew employment agreements for Rob Benson and Mark Dana Davis.  Rob's has expired 2/1/01 and Dana's expires 2/28/01.  I would be happy to supply you with recommendations.  Please let me know at your earliest.  Thanks!

This is bizzare.  Global Markets promised Jean this money and won't seem to write her a check.  It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.

John
John -

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?

this one is from john - and should say from john

 

Dave
 
I think we are going to go back to the original Pebble Plan.  The 8th to the 11th.  Tych and Calger are O.K. with this.  There is a small chance that I will have to cancel or come back Saturday night but what the hell.
 
Let me know if you can do this and we will all attempt to arrange transportation.
 
John
 
P.S.  Sorry for the confusion.
 

IGNORE FRANK.
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TRADING POWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT MIGHT CHANGE SOON.

John,

Did you put Frank Hayden up to this?  If this decision is up to me I would consider authorizing Mike G., Frank E., Keith H. and myself to trade west power.  What do you think?

Phillip
I've been asked to provide an updated list on who is authorized to cross trade what commodities/products.  As soon as possible, please reply to this email with the names of only the authorized "cross commodity" traders and their respective commodities. (natural gas, crude, heat, gasoline, weather, precip, coal, power, forex (list currency), etc..)

Thanks,

Frank

PS. Traders limited to one commodity do not need to be included on this list.

I wasn't aware of schedule B. What is it.

Hi John,

Was great to see you last week.

I'll send you the list of goals and objectives for 2001 next week.

Have a great WE,

Remi

<<Balance of Energy.xls>> <<ESA map.ppt>> 

I would like to do a phone interview and then I will bring him in if I like him.

Send me a resume and then I'll set him up.

I look forward to the updated supply demand analysis.

John

John, 

Per your request this fall for updated Ontario Supply and Demand information, this email is confirmation that OPG has agreed to release updated transitional 2000 market data.   Once this data is posted to the IMO website, I will forward you a complete & updated Ontario Supply and Demand report (as my last report was not complete due to OPGs previous refusal to update the data they provide to the IMO).

Garrett

FYI
Alec:

Sorry for the delay in responding to your request for updates to the
information that OPG provided through the IMO's Transitional Information
Team process. After considering the merits of your request, and in the
interests of fostering continued good relations, we have decided to update
the Transitional Team information with relevant year 2000 data.

In order to be fair to all market participants, we propose giving the
updated information to the IMO and asking them to update their Website. We
have approached the IMO in this regard and the preliminary indications are
that they are willing to do this.

As you recall the Transition Information Team process resulted in the
release of approximately 43 different types of reports (I have attached a
list of these reports below). Generally, the reports fall into four
categories: (1) reports produced by the IMO released with our consent or the
consent of other parties as appropriate (i.e. Hydro One), (2)
information/reports produced by OPG, (3) information/ reports produced by
others, (4) one-off information items that would not be updated. In terms of
the specific information to be released,  I have highlighted in gray on the
attached chart the reports that we are planning on releasing and the reports
that we will work with the IMO to get released.

We are currently working with people inside the company and the IMO to
gather the information needed for the proposed information release. I will
advise you shortly on how this is progressing. Please call if you wish to
discuss.

What's the deal on Deregulation in Ontario.

FYI

Tom May@ENRON

01/26/2001 09:00 AM

FYI, 

It looks like Ontario may be delaying the opening of the markets.  I am not sure whether this will be more than the expected delay to a fall opening.  Apparently, some of the media are speculating that it will be delayed until after the next election which is likely in 2003.

John,

Willian Stuart has spent 3 months preparing the FX products you requested for distribution to our customers in Canada ( the noon day settlement products). As you can see, RAC has rejected approving these products.  We're ready to go.  I'll meet with them this week but will probably need your support.

Thanks,

I may be in Vegas that weekend.  I'll let you know it that changes.

Laura is currently scheduled to be in Houston for Unify testing on April 26 through 30th.  I'm overdue a trip to Houston, so I could schedule a trip around the same time if that timeframe works for you, either Saturday, April 28th or Sunday the 29th.   We're going to be a bit rusty since the courses up here aren't open yet.  Let me know what you think.

I met with Shea in Houston.  Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.  He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.  Until recently I was happy with Lambie.  Call me.  We should think about it.  

John, TCGS turned in another dismal performance last year losing C$150MM. Word on the street is that bonuses (payable later this mo.) are going to be zero or close to zero. Supposedly, Shea's group was the only P&L that made money. Timing maybe good to approach Shea once again.

What are your thoughts on moving McKay to Houston, and me going after Shea et al to run ECC's gas trading - Jury is still out on Lambie, and Disturnal is a non-starter. 

Let me know what you think and  I will proceed accordingly. 

it wasn't outrageous.  Call me if he is interested and we will talk about dollars.  Because he will be a VP candidate he will have to interview in Houston.

John, had lunch with Greg today... seems interested  - will let me know Monday if he would like to move forward. Do you recall what kind of $$$ you talked to him about previously? I understand that you were close on meeting expectations.

I take back my dog comment.

john
john, saw your CEO on the CNBC this mornng. He  looks and sounds impressive. Stock price does not seem to give a damn. From my  experience the price will show dramatic improvement once the overall tone of the  market gets better and the "California" bankruptcy situation is done  away with.
 
However have you seen the share price of dceg  lately. I think you called it a dog not long ago. We've increased in price by 5X  since the ridiculous lows reached just before Christmas.
 
Give my best to the family.

i talked to him last week and we are going to schedule something for next week.

Thanks Peter

Hey did Mungo or Mongo are whatever the hell it is buy my house.

Is there any stopping you! (But I'm guessing your not getting out running much any more.)  I really appreciated it when you called me at home on my recent promotion, but thought you might just get pissed of if I phoned you at home (maybe not).  Anyway, I won't bug you at home tonight, and I will congratulate you here.  Very impressive, well deserved.  The realignment involving both you and Delainey should be great for the company.  Push the stock.  Peter.

let's stay away

John Arnold called, he said El Paso is looking for Cal05 to Cal15 bid above last night's mid,  since it is past cal 10 I am not sure if

you want me to stay away from this.

Christina and Joe

Congrats.  I'm very happy for you guys.

We have been out of touch for way too long.

Hi John,
I just got your e-mail address, thought I'd try it  out! I hope all is well, I hear you are doing great (reports from my father and  from Nana)!! Please say hi to Dina and Michael for us. We are doing well, just  had baby #2 and life is like a circus around here, two is a lot more challenging  than I ever imagined! Take care,

Set up a time with Mike.

 

I will be in town next week Monday through Wednesday and wanted to get thirty minutes of your time and a cup of coffee.

Please let me know what might work in your schedule.

I apologize for not responding to your resume request sooner, but after

careful consideration of my future career, I am hesitant to make a career

gave me the opportunity to discuss the potential for employment with an

executive of the organization.  Unfortunately with the birth of my son, I am

hesitant to make any career change right now.  Based on the aforementioned

and in consideration of the valuable time of the Enron management team, I

would request that we cancel the meeting that has been scheduled for this

Wednesday.

Sincerely,

Edward Reitze

Dave Gallagher (our head of Continental Gas Trading) and Andy Fairley (gas trader in the UK) will be in Houston on Feb 12-14.  Can you please help them set up meetings with your commercial gas desks and the gas originators so they can learn from your guys on a number of fronts including:

I think your teams will be interested in what is happening over here in Gas as well.  Last year really saw the business take off.  We now have about 50 counterparties and are doing about 30 transactions a day in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and even an occasional deal in France.  Perhaps they could have separate meetings with you, the West Desk,  Texas Desk,  East Desk,  MidContinent Desk,  John Arnold,  Janet Dietrich, Fred Lagrosta's group,  Julie Gomez and any other ideas you have.

Basis Trading
?	How are the books structured
?	How do the various desks lay off the delta (mid or bid/offer, size parameters)
?	How the options are traded; understand the basis vol curve
?	Are there any clever originated structures that we can copy?

EOL 
?	Do the non-NYMEX locations move with fixed basis and what technology is employed
?	Setting the stack
?	Do they auction any virtual storage or pipeline capacity; an example of contracts

Back office
?	Is there a future for their deal entry system in Europe
?	Are they planning any electronic confirmation and billing system to hang off the end of 		EOL.
?	Are there any reports/ parts of the DPR that we need to have in EEL?

Their schedules are wide open so perhaps you could assign a lead to work with them to get the most out of this trip.    Thanks in advance for your help and time.

Prepared in contemplation of litigation -  Attorney Client Privilege

There appears to be no succinct way to write down my thoughts on where we are with El Paso but I'm going to try.  

Assumption:
Kilgore's objective:		Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap.
Outcome of lawsuit:	 	Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his 					ratios and revolver.

What do we want?
(i) 	To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position 		whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances 	of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes.
(ii) 	To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts 		without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much 		smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book? 	We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of 'true sale' treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other 		ways we can ensure this is off our credit.

If we sue them?  Loss of leverage.
We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore's accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for.

Way Forward:
We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York.  

Good Luck!

Thanks for your help on this.

FYI Folks-

The Kern River expansion that we backed out of (the 15 year stuff) is going to be 900,000 MMBtu/d.  As you can see a large number of the shippers stayed in the process, and are now bound to the pipe if it gets built!!

There will be a press release on this tomorrow...

Julie  :-)

We absolutely should do this.

We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.

There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.

PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp

Brooklyn Union

Peoples - Laura Luce

Enerconnect - Devries

My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.

Louisiana Pacific has sent me a letter requesting that John Malowney cover all of their energy needs in North America.  John has done an excellent job building this customer relationship to the point that they want to bring him into their energy management team.  This would include both gas and power, I think throughout North America.  I have never received a request like this and am not sure how to handle it.  John would like to do this, and would be willing to take the risk on committing extra time to LP in hopes of more deal flow.  Since this relationship would be broader than just West Power, I am looking for direction from you whether and how we should proceed internally.  Part of me says that it will be a big headache and time sink for which we will never get paid.  The other part of me says that this is exactly where we want to be with our customers and if they want John to represent them, then Enron needs to find a way to make it happen.  Let me know your thoughts.

Just talked to Shapiro.  He wants Lay, Alex and me in the meeting.  I of course was fighting Alex.  I'm okay with Lay meeting other people while he is in town.  Shapiro said he would get Alex working on the talking points.  You and Devries should spend time on them before they come to me.

John, we are confirmed with both the Premier's office and Lay for the 19th of June. I assume that you will be attending also. What are your thoughts on who should attend the Harris meeting and what other meetings should we set up to maximize the use of yours/Lay's time.

Brian Purchase is a key decision maker in Wilson's office. My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase. Aleck believes that it would be beneficial for Lay to meet with them also. 

Rob, we have Lay from about 1 pm to 6 pm.  The question is how to make the best use of his time.   After the Premier, I think  meeting Wilson and Purchase is  the best use of his time.  It is really Purchase I want Lay to meet, and it would be hard for Lay to meet Purchase without including Wilson (assuming of course he is available).  They will be among the key decision makers going forward.   If you have any other suggestions about how to make the best use of Lay's time here, please let me know.   

Aleck, I wouldn't have Lay meet with Wilson and/or Purchase but definitely Lavo could meet with them.

Regards, Rob

Lay is confirmed for the 19th.  We have him from one  to about  six.   Once I have the Premier's meeting tied down re time, I am going to try to arrange a meeting for Lay and Lavo with  Wilson and Purchase.  I think that is the best use of his time.  Let me know if you have any other or different ideas. 

How's that for VAR management.

This is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.
i haven't seen one of these in a long time.  then all of a sudden it shows up.  what is the standard for who gets to receive it.  for example, heizenrader is on the list but swerzbin is not.  any thoughts.

Please find attached the management summary and Hot List for May 11, 2001.  You will be receiving these reports every Monday afternoon.

If Michael Moutlon wishes to pay for this I'm O.K. with it.  The memory business was never sponsored by North America.  Please get Michael to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay.

Thanks

John, Chris Calger stopped by just now to let me know you wanted some more information on the Masters.  I was intending to take Mitch Taylor, manager of Intel's  fab plant in Hillsboro, Oregon who has been extremely useful to Enron in helping to understand the memory business.  The memory trading group has used him extensively as a resource to get them started (Michael Moulton and others) - they support taking him to the Masters.  Please give me a call if you have questions or concerns.  Thanks.  Wayne.

You should use 30 c1 with that many people.

All,

Wait until Louise gets back.  These should not be big.  ie 50 and 125 at most.  I'm not even sure that Irvine is the right guy in the end.

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?

David

No one needed for the PRC.  Jaime Williams and Steve Irwin are co leads.

John, I have the Mexico group. I am following up on this email to assess your interest in getting contracts in front of these indviduals.  Can you tell me if you will be following through on this or should I be directing this question to Louise?  Also, do you and Louise have a successor for Max in mind?  We will need to discuss PRC representation as well. My understanding is that Louise is planning to attend. Do we need anyone else to represent Mexico in the July 9th meeting?  Please advise or I will be happy to get on your calendar to discuss.

-  It doesn't need to hit the dpr.
-  Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's
-  If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem 
-  Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat. He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.  We're not trying to build Stat Oil here.
-  If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.

Having said all that.  If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.

Call me.

the numbers have been pulled out.  it was not possible to put it on the dpr for some reason.  that should be fixed this week.  swerzbin, wolfe, krebs, and malowney are all miserable.  mike is making life very difficult for middle market.  mike is now having is analyst, mike driscoll, respond to all rfp's.  life here is a lot more difficult than it was before we split the money out.  any advice?  do i just lean into mike?

Do not book anything related to Arcor until I say so.

The transfer of the Arcor plant and the assignment of the 6 Arcor PPAs are now official.  Therefore, next week, we will:

1.  Book the 6 Arcor contracts on the MTM book (Argentina power)

2.  Review with Vlady the best way to record the EPEC contract and the power plant spread option.

This is to inform that we received yesterday a hard copy of Resolution SE N? 4, that transfers the Generation License for Modesto Maranzana Power Plant from Arcor to us.

We have already talked with technical people at CAMMESA, and they told us that with this Resolution, they will accept (starting in April) the contract signed between ESA and ECEA to back up the PPAs that ECEA has signed with some Arcor's industrial plants.

I especially want to highlight the support that Mario Aguilar Benitez gave to the regulatory team to get this Resolution signed.

Dear Mr. Metts: 
  I am contacting you on behalf of the First American Management Enterprises and the Fort Berthold Development Corp. 
  We have the opportunity to aquire a contract to supply to the US Government, a large quantity of Natural Gas, Electricity, Propane,  Lubes and Fuels.  We feel that because of the size of this contract, it would require our company to obtain the assistance of a large company, such as Enron for this supply.  It will be nationwide and could reach a dollar amount of 2 billion per year and extend to possibly 10 years or longer.  We are now in the process of applications and acquiring more information.

  If this is something you feel Enron can help us with please contact us.  Thank you. 
  The contacts are as follows:  Bob Dennis- (701)575-8470

Can you get me Julie's presentation.

I'm in Toronto on April 4th and may be able to come to N.Y. However I would want to know how many meeting you would want me to attend and the message you would want sent if any.  Unfortunately, my time is unbelievably tight.  I can't assure you yet that I can make it, but I would like to try.

John- I am scheduling time with the hedge funds in the next 2 weeks for a few reasons. 

Either Mar 29/ 30 or Apr 4-6 would be perfect to meet with the 7 funds we are dealing with since I've already set up time for Bill Bradford and Julie Gomez then. When I know your availability, I can make a schedule.

1. Its important these clients meet SR management. I'd like to introduce you to the portfolio managers so they can explain the nature of their business and the potential for Enron (which is great).  Of those we deal with, we are doing 80-100% of their business.  This is predominately gas.. but we are the best situated to do the same in power, weather, coal, crude/products, etc...  They want to understand our structure.. they have not met anyone SR in ENA since Jeff left.

2. We are losing business with new clients everyday because of the credit/legal/backoffice process. I am bringing Bill Bradford around to meet the CFOs and port managers Mar 29 and 30.  We currently have a log jam of clients to get through the credit/legal system. We have one credit analyst working on our names but we share this person with many other groups.. In the 6 months I have been covering these clients, we have only gotten 2 ISDAs signed (and one we had been working on for a year prior to my arrival).  Credit will not allow us to trade without an ISDA even when their are no "credit" issues.... we do not take any exposure to these clients.. we MTM every day and in some cases call for a 5 day VAR on the MTM amount (this is typically how long it takes to get the MTM money in the door).   

The legal side of this process is also extremely slow.. they are excellent once you get them focused on your work  but due to all small number of them... it takes weeks to get to the top of the chain.  These clients have special needs- the deals they do are alocated to many accounts- all these accounts must be set up in our system properly and the deals booked correctly accross all the trading areas.  This is a timely process with a lot of holes at present.

We do not have enough personnel dedicated to this process. On a side note, no ISDAs means that they can also not trade on EOL.  To date, non of these clients have been able to trade on EOL although they are dying to.    

3. Understanding of market fundamentals = New business. These clients deal with us because we understand the energy markets.. we give them superior service.  Having worked at a bank for 6 years, I know what we provide is unique. Julie Gomez is going to give her state of the grid to them individually April4 -6.

Kind Regards,
Caroline

Hi Julie- sorry I've been quiet.. trying to figure out the best way to get your story (state of grid and production study)out to the hedge funds with the least amount of extra work for you.. I've had to scrap the group presentation idea since a few of the funds made it very clear to me that they would not feel comfortable asking questions with their "competitors" in the room.  So much for the easy road..

so this is what I propose.. there are 7 key relationship funds we need to deliver to and have a working question/answer session with.  Most are in the NY area.. we could do all the sessions in our office.. making the funds come into the city.. i think this will be good because if we get them away from the day-to day.. they focus better.. also, we do not have to travel!

I am thinking either April 4,5,6 or 18,19,20  (wed,thurs.fri).  We'll space out the presentations through the days over breakfasts and lunches. When I know you are available, I'll put a schedule together. The hedge fund business is really taking off now.. and your continued support directly contributes to more QUALITY trading relationships and trades.  The feedback we have been getting from the funds is that they think Enron "gets it" in terms of our view of the markets, trading style, fundamental research, and execution.. the banks just are not there... thus they really want to do business with us. In regards to what we are trading... still mostly gas and crude.. but getting close to executing power and weather deals, and possibly coal.

The funds we are currently trading with are:
NY:
1. Tudor (Proprietary, Ospraie)- Ospraie is managed by Dwight Anderson who you have talked to before- they are in our building. The main Tudor office is in Greenwich- we deal with 2 other portfolio managers there..not sure if we need to present there.
2. Catequil- managed by Paul Touradji and Rob Ellis who were at Tiger with Dwight- they are direct competitors to Tudor- Ospraie (same macro philosophy)
3. Global Advisors- managed by Danny Masters- more short-term traders but trade large positions.

NJ:
4. Willowbridge/ Union Spring: managed by Philip Yang... have both program funds and fundamental- will come to office.

Boston:
5. Harvard Endowment Fund- managed by Stu Porter - they will likely come down here.  Macro- relative value.. privately held so do not have to report performance swings (long-term MTM issues)

Greenwich, CT:
6. SAC Capital- many fund managers (similar structure to Tudor)
7. Paloma Partners- have FERC license to market physical power... mostly trade power, weather..

Let me know as soon as possible of your thoughts and availability.

Kind Regards,
Caroline

This could be very dangerous.  

OPG controls all the megawatts.  

They could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.  If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months.  

John, it appears that the government is looking for some assurances that prices will not spike this winter and/or they are short MW's  if they open the market November 1st. What are your thoughts on Enron underwriting some type of insurance for the government for the months of Nov, Dec, Jan - ie. possibly writing a call option for 2000 MW at some price that doesnt alarm the govt. 

I could approach OPG this week when I'm in Toronto and feel them out on the two companies finding a solution to the government's concern.

This is also something we may want Lay to offer to the Premier when he is in Toronto.

Benefits would be:

The government may feel obigated to go forward if they have paid a premium for the call starting nov 1(ie binding/firm contract)
We could potentially book a significant origination amount
We would work with OPG vs against - good for overall relationship
Solidifies our relationship with the Ontario Government (ie providing solutions to their problems)

Or did he leave me with the 2 Billion budget to get a 30 Million Budget.

All systems are go....but.....looking at significant Alberta transaction closing on March 12,13, or 14.  

I'll have more info on timing and probability early next week.

Derek
Derek

Your in on Pebble if you want.

Lavo.

You and Chris already have your own room.  That was an old memo.

Lavo

P.S.  We have always known that you didn't play well with others.

Guys, I'm not the sharing type  - book me in the Forest Room.

Delainey
These are the dates that we are going to graceland.  I suggest we arrive on Thursday evening and come back Sunday afternoon.  I'll now hand over the arrangements to Tycholiz Travel Co.

John Lavorato

Below is the availability of alternate rooms at the Inn at Spanish Bay for March 8-11, 2001:

Forest View Room @$425/night - some double queen size currently available.
Scenic View Room @ $475/night - no double accommodations available and single rooms are sold out.
Ocean View Room @$525/night - some double queen size currently available.

If you would like to pay by credit card, I will need the type of card, number, name & expiration date on the card.  Along with the credit card information, I will need to know the names of the other 3 people attending.

I have reserved golf for Friday, March 9th at 7:20 a.m. at Links at Spanish Bay and Saturday, March 10th at 12:00 p.m. at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Room availability is tight so we should move on this as soon as possible.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this event.
THANKS!

NO but we need to solve this quick because a lot divided by three is more than a lot divided by four.

Another math tip from Lavo

Did you hear back from Derek . I sent him and e-mail but did not have a chance to talk to him.  BT  

Louise

I'm in Toronto with Lay on April 4th.  You should attempt to go to this.

How about you being the Portland General risk manager.  My plate is full.

Lavo

FYI

Enron has negotiated a sale of PGE to Sierra Pacific Resources for $2.07 B
that has to take place by May 5th, 2001.

Sierra Pacific owns and operates power and gas utilities and pipelines in
the Western United States. Sierra Pacific (SPR) has a market cap of $0.92
B, trading at $11.85, down about 40% off the high of $19.44 in September of
2000. Sierra Pacific has earnings-per-share of <$0.85> and pays dividends
of $1.00 per share. Sierra owns generation assets and serves load in
Oregon and Nevada. Additionally, the Company serves a small load in Reno,
CA (~40,000 customers), which makes it subject to the regulations coming
out of CA crisis.

In order to pay Enron for PGE, the company has to sell its existing
generation assets, subject to regulatory approval from the respective
state PUCs. Given Sierra's financial situation and CA regulation
precluding load-serving entities from selling their generation assets, there
is a possibility that the transaction will not take place by 5/5/01.

Enron Development Group is the most optimistic in thinking that the sale
might still happen by 5/5/01. Enron Gov. Affairs experts expect the
transaction to be postponed by 6-12 months. PGE CFO and Head of Marketing
speculate that the sale may not happen for a long time or ever.

In the meantime, CA crisis has generally slowed down the deregulation
process in the state of Oregon. The earlier expectation that certain PGE
customers may be able to shop for alternate suppliers of electricity,
effective 10/1//01 is in question. This uncertainty makes it difficult to
estimate PGE's load going forward.

As of 2/9/01, PGE positions and risk (including generation capacity, load
and marketing positions) are as follows:

Power	VaR of $19.3 MM	2001:	Long 1,934,031 Mwhs
				2002:	Short 540,122 Mwhs
Gas	VaR of $0.8 MM	2001:	Short 1.4 Bcf
				2002:	Short 7.4 Bcf
Total VaR of $19.2 MM.

Next Steps

- continue to assess the possibility of transaction falling through or the
potential transaction date
- communicate to Enron Treasury the possibility of not collecting the
proceeds on sale this year
- monitor PGE positions weekly (VaR and positions)
- periodically assess the definitions of PGE load and generation
availability
- any other thoughts

Vlady.

You simply can't negotiate on a choice market.  Are your owed past fees for management? Let me know.  I don't run industrial markets and Greg would have to settle this dispute.  You would lose.

I think it is going to be difficult for us to convince you that we should take out Houston's share of PML at $11MM when it is not centre of the fairway for ECC (or ENA for that matter). However, at the same time, I don't want to take a hit to earnings given the amount of work that we have put into this thing - legal, board representation, and divestiture efforts.

I think taking me out at my cost ($12.35MM) is a reasonable proposition.

John

Greg has been looking into Portland's commodity position.  Apparently they are slightly long.

With the severe draught in Oregon my guess is PGE is shorter than 500MW this year. You may
want to ask Stan Horton about their status.

John

This is the position I am trying to liquidate and keep getting crossed up with Swerbin.  If you can't help, do not pass this on to Portland, I'm having enough trouble already.   

Chris

You should meet with Louise.  She is focused on the Power Business.  I will sit in if I'm available.

John:

I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday.  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details.  Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you on Monday or Tuesday.

Thanks!

Chris 

ok on both.
 
Please get Robert to sign a 3 month evergreen non compete.

Pursuant to you commercial hiring policy, I am seeking your approval to hire Robert Downer as manager  (C $125K) working for Disturnal. I understand that you did a telephone interview with him. He has a genuine interest in leaving Goldman Sachs and moving to Calgary.

We would have him back up disturnal (JD's in kemo for the next 3 months and may not be able to work) and help with structuring derivative products. In addition, we need more bodies in trading - particularly if Lambie is shown the door.

fyi.... Stephane has agreed to move back to Calgary for May 1. I plan to give him a lump sum payment of C$10K for him agreeing to do this. He didnt ask for this but I think it is the right thing to do.

Please advise.

Dave 

Can you follow up on this.

John,

Attached is a memo sent to me by Mr. Fabac, who works for Thomson CSF and reports to one of my best friends in France.  These guys are responsible for 9 Thomson plants in the world and would like to revise their strategy in power and gas supply.  They would consider a global agreement, or an agreement restricted to a lower number of plants.  They have 3 plants in the US, 1 in Mexico, 4 in Europe (France, Italy, Poland) and one in Asia (China?).  Their global average consumption of power is about 90 MW;  Gas and power consumption (and billing) for 2000 are detailed in the attached spreadsheet.

I suspect that we are intersted in this business opportunity.  Would you be kind enough to pass on this message to somebody who could take care of this (potentially) new account, or at least recommend a name to whom I could sent this information?

Remi

Tim 

Give me a call on this I don't understand.

John

For some period of time, various West Power desks have been the default desk which received gas positions for new books that were not properly setup in TAGG.  I have worked with our risk team and the techology group to get West Power out of this problem.  I'm happy with the result from the West Power point of view.  

I am writing to alert you that one half of the problem still exists.  If someone does a gas deal and hasn't set up a new book properly and doesn't carefully track his/her position, the trade goes into a dummy book that nobody manages.  Days, weeks, or months later you discover the trade and take the hit or the gain.  I think that this risk is real because we were the ones finding the misplaced gas trades before -- not the gas desk with the misplaced trade.  Now nobody will find them unless the gas trader realizes that some of his/her position is missing.

These are the facts as I understand them.  I'm sure that Stacey White, Steve Nat, and Monica Lande could fill you in with more detailed information.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
 
Monica Lande
02/14/2001 02:34 PM
Tim,

Steve has described the problem accurately.  Setting up a dummy book solves the problem for us, but not for Enron as a whole.  If no one monitors the dummy book on the daily basis (which probably won't happen if there is no ownership), then you still have the possibility of positions falling into that book and never showing up in the book that they were intended.  Why can't a process be put in place for the initial set-up of a book in TAGG?

Monica

do you guys agree?
Tim,  The root problem was related to the default mapping logic in the 'interface' job that moves the ERMS gas calc results to the portcalc results tables.  If mapping logic is not set up for a new book, the job was defaulting the gas deals to the ST-PLT desk.  The default mapping has been changed to a dummy  ZZ_erms book, which will prevent the deals from showing up in the wrong book if the mapping logic is not updated.

In reference to Beth's concerns... turns out this was a limitation in our production code, not an IT change to production data, so we should be OK on that front.  

The long-term solution would be to remove the hard-coded logic, set-up table structures, and maintain the mapping rules through a user screen.  Given our other priorities, and the default logic change, we will not pursue this option.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Steve

thanks for the concise description of the problem.  i should have cc'd you on the original message.  your description is much better than mine.  now that beth has a better understanding of the issue, how long will it take to get solved!?

The problem is not that we should enter a reversing trade in the system as this would misrepresent the positions across the board.  The problem is that the position belongs to another book within Enpower.  The users have no access to the screens which define where our gas books are mapped in Enpower; therefore, IT has to manually define the correct mapping for us.  When the manual fix has not been made, we have true positions for one book mapped to another book.

Stacey

Tim,

Sorry about this.  A better question to ask is why are systems people manipulating data?  Why can't the users put on a reversing trade?  I'm having fits about IT resources touching production data and I can't tell you how many times we screw ourselves up because IT does this. 

I'll let you know the end result.  Sorry again, but these practices have to stop!

Beth

words cannot describe how distressing this problem is.  in terms of mis-reporting our risk, we are dropping mmbtu's from some other book into our book as mwhs.  mmbtus go for around $10.  mwhs go for around $400.  why is this problem so hard to fix?

Tim:

Please note that as of 2/13 there will still be 1,321 MWhs of Nymex Swap position in ST-PLT book (COB) which is yet to be cleared out by IT.   I have sent out an email to Norman Lee in IT and will follow up with him to make sure this problem is removed asap.  (The "unknown" position of the -311,354 MWhs showing up on 2/12 has already been taken cared of.)

Sounds fine.

I haven't seen the latest agenda for Ken.

John, your thoughts re the attached? Also, I think its highly likely that we will get a meeting with Lay and Harris.
Our thought was that it would be useful for Ken Lay and John Lavorato to met with a group of very senior people in the investment community to outline our case for market opening.   A proposed initial list is attached.  It should be expanded to include Ron Munkley  from CIBC World Markets and Bill Homer of Scotia Capital.  The thinking behind this is that these guys are all senior advisors to the Gov't, OPG or Hydro One on decontrol and related issues and several, such as Long, Lindsay and Hudson, are among the Premier's closest advisors.  Let me know what you think so, if we decide to go ahead with this, we can do so soon.   << File: April4Invitees.xls >>

Just a soundbite from a PRC email.  I am getting worried about Mike G. and myself.  Are you open to more discussions?

Phillip

When I submitted my list of feedback providers for (your) approval, I received the following message:

Your reviewers have been saved however, your supervisor does not have a valid internet email address in PEP. Please ask your supervisor to approve your suggested reviewers. Please click here to go to the Home Page <javascript:top.frames[0].goHome('../')> 

I would be grateful if you could you go into the PEP system and approve my reviewers manually, so that they receive my request for a review early in the week.

Many thanks.

YES

John, did I understand you correctly... are we going to review Analysts and Assoc's in our commercial PRC review process on July 9?  

yes

For the sake of the optics of this I take it you have instructed the desk to take some of the heat out of the position ?

I just need numbers.

I would be interested in looking at the analysts/associates; however, interns are too short time for risk.  The training does outweigh the benefits.

Thanks,

We are getting in several anylysts and associates  (new hires) in the next few months.  We also have interns coming for summer only.  Do you need any.

Can you use interns or does the training out weigh the benefits.

I'll work up some paper.

I can commit to 6:00 pm every week,  and 7:00 pm on an "as needed" basis--hopefully this won't be every week, but I will stay if needed.

Can the full Day end at 7.

John--
Assuming you get the o.k. on the work arrangement we discussed yesterday........

As a follow up to our discussions, particularly concerning working the second half of the day once each week, here is what I would propose:  Instead of working 4 half days in the morning and one half day in the afternoon/evening, I would work 3 half days in the morning (8-1) and one full day.  This way I would be available to meet with Geoff in the afternoon once each week.

Please let me know if this works and if the arrangement in general is acceptable to HR, Louise, etc.  Thanks.

Your buddy Beau invited me.  How about prior to that or after that on Tuesday.

not really...

already have plans on thursday .

are you going to the NYMEX candidate cocktail hour Tuesday?

oh god is there an agenda.

That sounds reasonable, however, I am looking at taking a different tract (ie.  going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company).  This has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 2 weeks.  I will keep you posted.

Lavo

PS  That's the longest email I've ever written.

John, I am a bid for a significant number of units that could take your costs and capabilites to scale quickly; however, I will not employ AMPS versus other suppliers unless EES is able to participate in the equity upside that our capital will create.  Please consider because it makes more sense than me going external.

EES and EBS are going to cut commercial staff as well as non-commercial.

OK. I am aware of where EBS are and will monitor closely. 

I presume you are referring to Commercial staff mainly. 

I had some preliminary discussions with Greg W about where EWS stood on this. It seemed that ENW may be the target for many.My understanding is the vast majority of these are technology people (allegedly). Robert Jones and Phillippe and Greg Piper are on the ball.

David 

I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.

Is this because you are focusing all you attention on the Diversity Committee.?

If possible, I would like to replace myself with another VP (Jean ??).   Rogers told me he would like to stay on the Analyst committee.   Ben Jacoby and Ozzie Pagan are also participants so East Power is well represented in the process.

Thanks.

This is clearly an Associate.  He just left business school didn't he.

I was thinking Manager given his work experience.   Is that a problem?

so did I.  Are we going to make him rotate.  He should probably rotate for 6 to 12 months.

I guess you are right.   He had 4-5 years of work experience prior to MBA and now approx. 8 months after his MBA.

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase - not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
	- clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
	- urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the "world" to the CA utilities
	- remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

	- Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and 	  EES will assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM, 	  in exchange for Avista and MS exposures.
	- PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable from 	  PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
	- addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
	- overall increase in prices
	- incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

That was a pretty clear answer and pretty speedy too.  Suggest we have a chat at some point Dave on how we move forward on this.

Louise:

I am NOT taking the P/L swings or funding this investment.  If there is confusion, let's get together with Dave.

Andy

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

WHY ARE WE STILL SLEEVING DEALS FOR BRIDGELINE.  UNLESS WE ARE GETTING COMPENSATED FOR THIS I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

Frank,
I think that you are handling it appropriately.  Lavorato and other ENA sr. mgmt should be apprised of the facts and the your opinion of the potential risks and solutions.  After they have made the decision, then we need to make sure that the procedures/processes/ and risk capture are consistent with the business expectations.  Please make sure that the Energy Operations staff is aware of this as well as credit so that they may adjust their behaviour accordingly.
As a house-keeping item, I do not think that it is appropriate for me to be CRO of Bridgeline.  I would nominate you or Vlady.
Ted

   

Ted,
A little background regarding this email.  Sometime back a ENA "sleeving" arrangement was set up for Bridgeline, addressing Bridgeline's poor credit rating.   Upon execution with the broker, confirms would be sent to Bridgeline/ENA and ENA/counterparty.  Evidently, a majority of these deals were short term in nature and dealt primary with intramonth gas daily markets.

Today, Bridgeline has a larger budget and is striving to trade larger, consequently the sleeving arrangement is being used more frequently.  I spoke with Brad Horn regarding this and told him that it would be far more appropriate to trade using EOL instead of the sleeving arrangement.  He resisted this idea because of the EOL "haircut", and difficultly getting market data if not transacting in the "real" world.  

This potentially creates a legal issue, as well as may cause ENA to wear unnecessary execution and market risks.  I say this because, at times, in order to execute the trade, Bridgeline has to represent themselves as Enron, and basically tell the broker that the deal is done with so and so on the 32nd floor. (Think of what would happen should the counterparty "walk" on an in-the-money deal because Brad wasn't an authorized trader --admittedly, this hasn't happen and the deal is still sleeved.....  An additional note is that I spoke with Brad regarding the situation and he promised never again to represent himself as an ENA employee.  (He recognized his error...)

I apprised Scott Neal and John Lavorato of the issue and at present it is my understanding that they are working on a solution. I have recommended that either the sleeving arrangement become formalized (written and reviewed by legal) or that transactions be directed through EOL.

Let me know your thoughts.

Frank 

 

Vlady,
I spoke with Brad regarding the current situation.  In summary, we agreed that the present relationship between ENA and Bridgeline, allowing deals to be sleeved needs to be formally documented (satisfying legal concerns/issues) and/or trades need to be directed through EOL.  Specifically, directing trades through EOL presents problems for Bridgeline, from wide bid/ask spreads to "stagnant" market information.  (i.e. knowing that El Paso is active in the market helps them better manage/optimize their system)

Presto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.  Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.  It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.  If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.

Lavo

CDWR is not positioning itself to buy new power assets.  Whether or not they buy the output from Pastoria, the plan would be for us to sell the project this year.  Calpine is the high bid and they are open to the project having a California toll on it.   We believe that the proposed pricing of the power sale to CDWR would be attractive to other power plant buyers as well as Calpine. Our current obstacle relates to water - Azurix breached their water deal with the project so we are "fixing" it by dealing directly with a backup water supplier.  

Can we sell them Pastoria or do we have to sell them the power from us.

Gentlemen:

I have spoken with CDWR several times since we submitted our proposal.  They are immediately interested in a 5 year power sale and then want to discuss Pastoria.  I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year ($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start trading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow, but so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds.  Until that happens, we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear from them again later today.  I will keep you posted.

Regards,

Chris

I keep hearing that we will resolve the tape issue soon.  Can we go over to the broker's office and listen to the tapes.

Not yet.  Geralsul wants to listen to the tapes first, but refuses to sign a letter that protects the broker against any lawsuit (even though customary, conversation recording without express awareness of the counterparty is "illegal").  We hope to resolve the tapes issue by Friday.

Remi

Is the Geresul contract done.

Unfortunately we seem to have lost the deal with CSN today.  This caught us by surprise: they claim that they were offended by the changes in the contract that we submitted this morning as well as by the call that was made to S? Paulo de Oliveira (to try to get CSN guarantee).

Next step: I don't think that there is much of a chance of getting the deal with any type of intervention, although opinions differ on the matter.  We need to talk about it tomorrow.

Remi

My question is where do I find the graphs.

 

I ask again. Who in ENA did the deal.

Rogers,

The only other detail that I have is that it is a FIRM delivery, full requirements contract, and the monthly volume fluctuated from 7,000 MMBtu to a monthly high of 32,000 MMBtu.  The P&G Plant is located in Lima, Ohio on the West Ohio Gas, a local distribution company.

I don't have much more detail as the user information at EnergyGateway.com is confidential.  But we know that ENA was the lowest bidder and that EES/EWS was the second lowest bidder.  

There may be an overlap of responsibilities here where we could help out and consolidate these retail positions.  

Jess

 
Rogers Herndon@ECT

Jess -

Can you provide some more detail here. 

John, I have always been told that the East desk did not wnat to consolidate the scheduling of retail with wholesale due to all of the balancing risks associated with load like this.  I am ok with them bidding on load, but I think this is a sign that we should begin consolidating scheduling functions under wholesale - I think this would be most efficient.

Rogers 

I'm confused by this one. Who in ENA is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing.

FYI.  John, you said to smother you with e-mails so you could understand what was going on so just let me know if I am overdoing it.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

On Wednesday the President of Petro-Canada approved the extension of our Wholesale Gas Services Agreement after the first term expires November 1, 2002, for an incremental 5 years.  This has taken me a a while to get closed (and while doing so we have had to keep up a consistently high level of service), but keep in mind it's not easy to renew something half way through the first term.

This extension is very significant for the following reasons:
1. It creates a MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN, net of directly attributable costs to provide the back-office services;
2. It supports further deal flow and potential incentive arrangement income (along with all the production information etc.);
3. Of even greater importance it provides a very critical and frequently used marketing tool as we continue to build our gas and power businesses across Canada.  As you know, we have used the Petro-Canada arrangement as an example of the services we can provide, not only when marketing in Canada but also in the US and Europe.  Now we can tell potential customers that we not only have provided services to this customer for 3 years, but they've liked it so much they've already extended the agreement for five more years after the first term - the message has to be that we are providing a good quality of service. 

Obviously this is a great credit to our Commercial staff and the Operations, Accounting and IT staff that work with Petro-Canada.   I will separately advise each of the individuals who works on this account about the renewal and congratulate them.  It takes alot of effort to "enchant" the customer day after day, year after year.  In fact it's incredibly difficult to be effectively on trial day in and day out as a service provider.

The numbers:
Under the extension, we have provided Petro-Canada with a rebate applied to the remaining term of the agreement from our original base fee.
Original base fee is $1.75 MM CDN per year, payable monthly.

Rebate offered:
Jan/01 - Nov/01				($458,300) CDN
Nov/01 - Nov/02			($517,000) CDN
Fee charged for extension term:
Nov/02 - Nov/03			$1,366,000 CDN
Nov/03 - Nov/04			$1,400,000 CDN
Nov/04 - Nov/05			$1,435,000 CDN
Nov/05 - Nov/06			$1,470,000 CDN
Nov/06 - Nov/07			$1,510,000 CDN	

We have thoroughly defined our back-office costs required to provide these services at $428,700 CDN/yr (2000$), and have 3 years of operating history to support this as a projection (with escalation at 2% per year) for the second five year term.  These costs include back-office staff allocations (salaries and benefits), and rent/infrastructure allocation.  We have checked on the allocation of Houston costs, and on a per transaction basis these are insignificant compared to our base business transaction levels.  We do not include commercial staff costs in the above as they are covered by the incentive arrangement and ongoing transaction deal flow.
In discussions with Wes, this definition of the costs and certainty about the arrangement scope, will allow us to MTM this income.  The MTM income of $2.9 MM CDN includes the rebate offered for the last two years of the current term, and has been reduced by the above annual costs.

Notes:
1.  We have not defined the incentive fee for the second five year period yet as we are doing some work at the moment with PCOG on what our benchmark should be, given that much of the intermediate Producers in the group of 40 have disappeared.  We will revise the agreement to reflect the fact that there will be a further revision once the incentive fee is agreed to.
2. If Petro-Canada's sales volumes fall to 60% of last years levels, there will be a price reopener for the remaining term because we have defined the fee as an absolute cost rather than per unit rate.  We also have a reopener on price if the volumes grow to about 140% of today's levels.  Petro-Canada has a growth strategy for gas so this is not at all expected.  Volumes over the last 6 months have increased by about 7-8% year on year.
3. Peter and I should have the amended agreement out next week.

I thought you would find this funny.

by this ratio the rest ot the power group is really underperforming!!!!

This 250K came from about 3 MW.
We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Check into this.  If these were index trades they should be in our physical volumes not financial.

i am 95 percent certain that the power financial volumes are really power index transactions.  when we do an index transaction enpower splits it into a financial swap and a physical transaction.  if you look at the pattern it perfectly mirrors our index transactions.  volumes began to increase in april of 1998 when the california market opened and we had a large volume of sales to ees at a px index price.  volumes grew as ees' load grew.  then ees began to hedge themselves and buy index from others, so we saw a steady decline in the index volumes.  last april we had a large number of index sales which accounts for that blip.  now the index market is dead and the volumes reflect this.

the physical volumes are right on.  they perfectly match the data that we use here.

I remember that we talked about him.  Can you please give me a call.

I gave you his resume 3 months ago.   I am sending another copy upstairs today.   He would be a manager level hire.   No, he is not the ex-metals trader.

I would like to hire this guy ASAP.

sounds good

John,

Here is the calculation of the 487,856.

The taxable benefit from the option was 537,672 - 153,174 = 384,498.

We then allocated a portion of the benefit to work days in Canada between
the grant date of August 11, 1997 and the exercise date November 30, 2000.
The ratio of Canadian days to total worked out to be 645/755.

We then calculated the Canadian portion (645/755 * 384,498) which was
328,478.
Then converted it to Canadian dollars (1.4852 * 328,478) which equaled
487,856.

Hopefully this explanation answers your question.

However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Joh/Kevin

I am sorry, but I cannot believe what I read below.  

Arch of Chicago - multiply by EXPECTED number of accounts??????
Suiza - How do we measure milk production, we cannot even manage energy consumption - Got Milk?????
Packaged Ice - ??? I hope we don't have any ice facilities in California.

Conclusion - I do not expect that we will do any more deals like this anytime soon.

Rogers

The brief synopsis on causality of the losses are as follows:

Arch of Chicago

The deal was originally priced (in 1998) with one account and the results were multiplied by the expected number of accounts.  We have re-priced the deal with actual volumes from our billing system (to capture all active volumes).

Suiza

The revenue is based on a production index (gallons of milk).  We have updated the revenue from the Consumption Desk and re-priced costs with data from our billing database.  In addition, we have worked with the Account Manager to segregate pass-through vs. active volumes.

Packaged Ice

The revenue is based on a production index (bags of ice).  We have updated the revenue with data from the Account Manager and the Consumption Desk.  We have also re-priced costs with data from the our billing system.

Conclusion

The losses are amalgamation of structured vs. actual volume differences, production index revision and initial modelling error.

If I can be of further assistance to you, I can be reached at 3-1902.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Mike Kim

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

I'm talking to Dave about Hughes reporting to Sally.
They don't need to even check the bill.  They can have a customer service g=

John -

FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting a=
nything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group th=
at is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our rec=
onciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk A=
nalysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes=
).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade S=
tubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconcilia=
tion.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the "Cust=
omer Touch" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our g=
etting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly=
 reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.  I think EES needs to be =
given an ultimatum to 1) either provide us with a Settlements function that=
 allows us to flash and reconcile or 2) get out of the way.  We can provide=
 them with the bill and they can lick it.

Rogers,

I'll wait for Mike's response, but these should all be forward volume adjus=
tments as a result of truing up the volumes based on actual data received. =
 The past activity difference is captured in our potential flash to actual =
adjustment that we have pegged at a rough $75MM right now.  One of the diff=
iculties we have in reconciling flash to actual is the difference in actual=
 volumes versus volumes liquidated from the books/batch models.  With respe=

 Project Phoenix team will want to get from Evan Hughes' group to get the f=

on many of our deals.

Again, let's verify the above with what Mike's response is.

Hey Chris;

The property with the party room facing the Gardiner (not Gardener dumb ass)

which means I could use just my profit portion to purchase the property next
to yours! I wouldn't live there though, as I have a red Rumplestiltsken like
acquaintance whose looking to move into a neighborhood where he can "feel
comfortable." The $200 monthly rent I'd get would come in handy in my
philanthropic endeavors in helping rid the world of Red Scourge Disease,
which is deadly when left unchecked and unabated.

Keep 'em coming pal, you serve them up and we'll keep knockin' them out!

Take care Red mate.

No I haven't sold anymore.  Given your concern about the selling gas beyond Cal 10, I bought back the Cal 11-15 piece on Friday.  I made $0.12 on it.  Derek is working on selling 50 MW to Powerex for 10 years out of 02 and we have 10 MW of customer deal for 5 years out of May 01 that is close to closing.  I will update this spreadsheet as changes occur.

You might want to spend more time on Cuiaba.  I assume your aware that we are putting all aspects of the project into the accrual bucket including the stuff we once marked.

Rebecca and everyone - TGS presentation can be 45 minutes.   On Cuiaba - that can go for 1/2 hour.  Between Transredes, GTB, TBG, and the GAs Unit - can take 45 minutes combined.  If we are adding more time to the agenda - I think a seperate discussion on Petrbras would be useful.  After Jeff hears about wholesale and the assets - it will be clear Petrobras is everywhere.

Gentlemen,

John and I spoke today on the schedule for Jeff's upcoming visit and decided that it may be light relative to time allocated to the asset reviews.  So, we are proposing that Tuesday, all day, be the asset day.  With Elekro slotted for an hour as originally planned, this extends the time for all of the other assets from the allocated 1.5 hours to a much longer time, including time for the heads of those businesses to have discussions with and answer questions from Jeff.  Also, if Elektro was strapped for time in the original allocation, this change leaves some breathing room for a bit more time there as well.

Pete and Orlando,  I would much appreciate a return memo outlining how you propose to spend the day with these changes.

Thanks much,

John, Joe,

We are ready to book the TGS capacity for the next 13 months (April 01-April 02 included) - rationale of the 13 months: winter season starts in May.

We chose a conservative approach to book all capacity that was not sold yet against our monthly demand payments.

As of today, impact is a loss of $2.5 million.

However Rolo closed successfully the Profertil transaction (13 month, sale of 175,000 cm/d delivered in Bahia Blanca).  Contract is apparently already signed by counterparty and will reach our office in BA by Monday (they already nominated April 1st gas).  When we book this transaction, TGS capacity position drops to a loss of $700K only.

For the sake of earnings stability, I therefore recommend that we postpone the booking of TGS position until Monday when we get the Profertil contract in hand.  The following will happen:

TGS Transport: loss of $700K plus reversal of Jan-Mar losses on TGS ($800K loss will be moved from Gas trading to TGS transport).
Gas trading Profertil: gain $160K (approximately)
Gas trading Chevron (to supply commodity to Profertil): gain of $100K approximately.

We negotiate with Camuzzi to sell them the optionality (15 day interruptibility) that we obtained from Profertil.
We are left with some summer excess capacity that we will try to sell a best price.

Let me know if you agree with my timetable.

Remi

 
Rodolfo Freyre
03/30/2001 11:53 AM
Remi,

We need to decide how and when to book the TGS FT Capacity. If we only book the current deals we have (5 P customers, Renault and Bagley), the MTM Book loss will be $2.5MM (booking 13 months - starting April 1st, 2001 thorugh April 30th, 2002).

If we decide to book Profertil, then the MTM Book loss will be $700K (instead of the $2.5MM). Additionally, we still have 15 days of optionality in the Profertil contract that we have not booked and could be valued at approximately $250K depending on how the negotiations I am carrying out with Camuzzi (LDC) end. 

Chevron will also add another $100K to the MTM book.

Keep in mind that the YTD gas book is ~$800K down due to the TGS demand charges during Jan, Feb and March.

Please advise on what and how you want us to book these different deals (keep in mind in mind Q1, Q2,....).

Tks,

Rolo

Sorry I missed you on your recent visit to SAC.  I hope the visit was rewarding and offers good potential.  Gavin has told me about your meteoric rise to the upper echelon of one of the US's fastest growing and profitable companies...good stuff.  Congrats on your successes, and stay in touch with us, because this place is growing at warpspeed as well.
Funny, I was thinking about how much trouble and discouragement we both had in getting sales and trading jobs out of Kellogg.  Guess Goldman, et. al., weren't too bright after all.
Are you still playing hockey?

Hey John,

Greg Johnston was recently given a copy of the Settlement, Assignment and Assumption Agreement Number 3 between Enron Canada Corp., PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation and Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership which you signed on ECC's behalf as of January 25, 2001.  In order to avoid having to recirculate the agreement, I have amended the attached resignation to be effective as of January 31, 2001.

Unless you anticipate signing more agreements on behalf of ECC, please sign the attached document and have Kim return the original to me for the minute book.  

Thanks,

I'm meeting with Dick and Mike at 9 and 10 this morning.  I'll let yoy know if there are any problems.

When you sober up give me a call.

I thought Eric was gas.  

Depending on the cost profile we would probably still do this.  The question is do you buy options on sites, buy sites, and whether or not you pursue permits.

John, we have now identified the resources necessary to identify potential development sites in Ontario. Our focus would be on the Toronto region with the intent of selling the site once permitted vs. building. Is this still something you want us to pursue? pls advise.

Please do ask Lavo about spending the money on this optionality (to develop a site with intention to sell not build).  We would do it for a 520 MW combined cycle and for the mobile units in  the Toronto region.  I'd like to either move forward or kill this, now that I have the resources lined up.  Thanks.

John, Ken Lay asked me to send you the information for the contact person re:  the small power plant in Utah.  His name is Charles Darling at DQ Holdings.  The phone number is 713-572-2244.

You don't need Presto. It's administrative and has nothing to do with him.

John,
I've been asked to set up a primary power desk contact for sleeving South American power.  I spoke with Presto and he mentioned that he has no interest in sleeving anything for South America.   The proposed structure is that North America Power would sleeve deals for South America.  Deal structure would have two legs, North America/external counterparty and North America/Enron South America.  (all transacted through EOL)

Let me know your thoughts.  

Frank

Sorry 
 
I didn't realize it was Good Friday.  I took the day off.  Let's hook up in the next couple of weeks.

John,

If you are still interested in playing today, let me know what time so that I can reserve a court.

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.

I would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.  I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.  I basically told everyone to drop it when Mike proposed his numbers.  Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.  We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.  For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.  

Let me know if you want to discuss it further.

where do we stand now?  last i heard was an e-mail from oxley (which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore) which said that we don't think that we are going to get there, but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech.  it's been a few weeks now, and i am checking status.  do you still want to offer him the initial contract?  i doubt he'd take it but i need to know.  what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable?  i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution.

Can send me Tim's home adress and wife's name.

Tych told me Lucci was done.
Hunter told me that Lewis was done.
Witt implies to me he was done.

We are in the initial stages of developing a commercial outsourcing proposal for Total, CMS and Reliant Energy in Argentina. I will be in Houston next week and wanted to get a down load on the most applicable outsourcing structures that have been concluded or that Enron has experience with. Could you let me know who would be the appropriate person to get in touch with. 

The Total transaction is the most comprehensive and would involve management of the power commodity, gas commodity, gas capacity and operations and scheduling as being envisioned now.

Please let me know your thoughts.

As requested,   one page detail on trading track with regard to:

Rotations
Line Supervisor
Management Team
Training Dates

Training dates may change, subject to desk heads schedules therefore I will update this once a month and forward.

Thx. Karen .

 << File: Trading Track  Rotations 406.xls >> 

I would like Joe Casas (currently East logistics) to participate in the interview process.
We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

Lavo

From the resumes that you reviewed, 6 people have agreed to speak with your traders (the remainder have yet to return our calls).   Is there specific names you would like to handle the telephone interviews or are you happy for me to select from the list ?    Once confirmed, I will forward the resumes to the approrpriate traders.

Thanks, Karen.

Why is EES's var being put in my 60 Million limit.

Lavo

The Enron Corp. Board of Directors is meeting today and tomorrow. If approved (very likely), the proposed limit changes will become effective tomorrow, Feb-13th:
						Current				Proposed
NA Natural Gas					$60 MM				$61 MM*
NA Power					$50 MM				$54 MM**

* NA Natural Gas limit will also include all positions in the EES and Cross-commodity portfolios. As of 2/9, EES Gas VaR was $0.1 MM and Cross-commodity Gas VaR was $1.4 MM.

** NA Power limit will also include all positions in the EES and Cross-commodity portfolios. As of 2/9, EES Power VaR was $ MM and Cross-commodity Power VaR was $0.2 MM.

Also, $10 Million of Discretionary VaR is currently allocated to NA Natural Gas. Again, if limit changes are approved, additional $5 MM of Discretionary VaR will be allocated to Gas:

						Current				Proposed
NA Natural Gas	with Discretionary VaR		$70 MM				$76 MM*

As of 2/9, Gas VaR was $73.5 MM and Power VaR was $36.4 MM.

If you have any questions, feel free to call me (x36954). Vlady.

I'm definately not going to support you on this.

Enron Industrial Markets has identifed a candidate in the London market that we wish to bring into Enron at the VP level.  He is a highly experienced individual with over 30 years of steel experience and would run the origination effort for steel in London reporting to Bruce Garner.  He has met several members of the executive committee already (see attachment) and his resume is attached to this email.  Ray Bowen will present him at the next executive committee meeting for approval.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me as soon as possible.

I once again asked about the committee.  I think Skilling, Delainey and Kean set up the committee and I'm told that there are going to be no changes.

You and I will need to go over your Vice Presidents prior to the meeting.

John

John,

Any word on whether I will get to participate in the Enron wide VP PRC?  As you know I served on the committee in past years and would like to continue to do so.  When you and Jeff Skilling were here in March, Miguel Padron and I raised this issue and Jeff acknowledged a need to consider my request.  You mentioned that you did not really have input into the list's composition and needed to figure it all out as well.

The kick off of the mid year PRC triggered my memory of this issue.

Thanks,

Kish

Vlady

Thanks for the update.

Come and see me Tuesday, I ned some help on South America.

Breaking News: US is bombing Iraq on Friday. Crude is up $0.35 , Gas is up $0.06, after hours.
ENE is down to $75-76 in the last few days (allegedly, Fortune Magazine is coming out with a negative article on Enron)
Gas VaR limit is $76 MM until 2/22 ($61 MM thereafter), Power VaR limit is $54 MM.

Gas

Weekly P&L - $79 MM (of which $87 MM is on the West Desk)
VaR as of 2/15 - $55 MM (mostly West and Financial Desks)

Two large down moves on Nymex of about $0.50 during the week, the curve flattened significantly and the 01 strip moves in-tact now, for the most part. Socal prices increased substantially to ~$25-30 for Feb and ~$14-15 for Mar.

Most traders have flattened their books, except for the following two trades:

- West Desk is long Socal Feb/Mar (Feb @ ~$25 and Mar @~$9.50). There is a great deal of bullish sentiments: PG&E hit the "90% rule", San Onofre plant   may stay off-line for quite some time and the 6-10 day forecast calls for Much Below weather in So. California.
- Financial Desk is preserving the Oct-01 length. Arnold argues that the end of the season is the best contract to hold - it moves up with the front on up moves and holds value on the down moves (I think he is right). He did a good job of hedging around this position.

Deals:	closed KCS Energy VPP deal on 2/16 - adds about 4,000 contracts of HH gas for 2001-2006 and about $4 MM of incremental VaR to the floor.

East Power

Weekly P&L - <$4.6> MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $22 MM (down from $35 MM)

The desk took off a lot of positions on Thursday ("chopped a lot of wood") - Presto wants to stay flexible and mobile, and have the opportunity to go either way (long or short) if market conditions change.

Deals:	unwinding Dayton P&L  for $13 MM cash, short 100 MWs of 4-hour calls (a hairy deal, out-of-the money ~$15 MM)
	submitting an indicative bid on 2/16 to TNMP for a full-requirements power deal in Ercot

West Power

Weekly P&L - $44 MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $22 MM (down from $35 MM)

The desk has been taking off some of their length in CA. Most of the risk on the desk comes from Long positions in Cal 03/04 and the Longs in 01. The outlook in the West is bullish, consistent with the gas story.

Deals:	negotiating a monetization with Avista ~$66 MM) - Enron delivers 25 MWs @ MidC 3/01-2/02 and receives 83 MWs 2/02-12/03 from Avista

Canada

Weekly P&L - $2 MM
VaR as of 2/15 - $20 MM

Southern Cone

Weekly P&L - $1.7 MM (new deals)
VaR as of 2/15 - $2 MM (increased from $0.3 MM)

Deals: 	executed 2 external deals with Gerasul and CGN Energia: bought 500,000 Mwhs for Cal 01/02.

EES

Reduced VaR from $12 MM to just over  $5 MM this week - taking off length in the West in 01 and further out. 

PS. Honored to have had the opportunity to manage you book last week - great learning experience. Also, makes me appreciate more the job of all the guys on the desk.

Vlady.

Tim

You will get stopped out.  I talked to David Port today because last year we spent a lot of time cleaning up gas var and now we must spend the time fixing power var.  However, until its fixed I have no choice but to use the reported numbers.
the numbers being generated for the west's var do not comport with what i believe our risk to be.  i think that it may have to do with the correlation across months and across locations.  for example, the ltnw book has a grant total of <3,000> MWh from now through September On-Peak and 194,000 MWh from now through September Off-Peak.  the var report shows mike with $20 million of var -- about $16 million of it coming between now and september.  we have a total var of $30 million, with about $20 million between now and september.  by my rough calculations, we would have to have the entire curve move roughly $100/MWh in one day for this var to be accurate.  that means that once every 20 days the entire summer curve -- peak and off-peak -- would have to move in excess of $100/MWh.  i might add that we are short q4 which i'm not giving us any credit for as an offset. 

i understand that there is a lot of risk on our books.  i just don't think that it is as much as the var model is spitting out.  wierd things happen in the var model and option valuation models due to the interaction of the blending formula on the volatility and the correlations as we approach delivery.  we see the same thing with option valuations.  we see option model valuations (e.g., transmission spread options) going through the roof when they are trading for fractions of our model valuations in reality.  similarly, the var model valuations move up really fast as the summer approaches.

bottom line.  i need to know what you want us to do.  we are chewing up a lot of var.  if we are going to get stopped out i need to know now.  i think that it would be a shame to close out of a largely spread position that wouldn't necessarily have any practical impact on our real profitability but would make the "model" happy.

love dceg

John, I read the Bloomberg note [or whatever they call it] that was on their
news site this a.m. Do they have a bee in their bonnet over Enron or what?
That is about as negative, if not personal, an article as one could want.
Normally when a company embarks on an expanded path to better use its
internal capabilities the market will first take a look at the recent
performance in making a case for its own judgement. Bloomberg seems to want
to ongnore your recent performance. After all one does not embark on any
vertical or horizonbtal expansion after a bad year, but when it can afford
the capital and time to do so before real results are generated.

So there. I did not like the article, nor the trone of it.

By the way did you like the dceg first quarter results?

Hi John,

Can you let me know if you wish to move forward with the non-compete agreements for the new trading track folks, in addition  we are due to send offers out to the external folks, do you wish me to hold on those (some of the documentationi s on your desk).

Thanks, Karen.

I haven't heard from the fellow from El Paso

Yes

I want to move next weekend.  If we can start at 2 PM on Friday it would be fine.

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.

Martin Bucknell

Can you settle this guy down.  As well as always whining about his fake trading account, he wants to accellerate out of real time early.  Tell him to do his time and learn.  Also he wanted to go to Harry's group next which is a mistake. He needs to learn the business not the derivatives.

hi Kam,

This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!

Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.

Thank you.

Punit.

P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere. 

Punit,

You have exceeded your VaR limit again today.  I will be taking $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  You must decrease your position today.

This list is virtually final.  Any changes will not be material.  I think you should add Louise in the 2-3 level.  I'll call you later.

I guess our confirm group shouldn't be worried

John -

Thought you would be interested to know that Dynegy does not have a confirm group.  They do not send confirms.  They just receive them from us.  I guess that they wait for settlement to catch issues over there.  That seems fairly risky.

JG

Thanks for your help Dorie.

See Barton Creek's comments below.

Hello Dorie,

I know this is not the most opportune time, but we have a final decision on
the suite pricing.  This special rate was more than 50% off of the original
pricing for just one bedroom.  It was something negotiated between
ourselves and we can't justify a lower rate on a sold out night for Mr.
Lavorato when he continued to stay in the suite.  This might be different
had he moved to a regular room and we could have upsold someone else to the
suite.   However, we had to walk away from that revenue.    I hope Mr.
Lavorato understands our business position.  Please contact me if you have
any questions.

tych  -  we are not below bbb

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

Can your respond to me so I can respond to Clayton
John-

Late October, Enron announced a change in the administrator for the Enron Savings Plan (our 401(k)s) and locked us out from making any changes in our asset allocations or contribution rules until November 20. This has generated an awful lot of resentment and deep conspiracy theories. Can you ask the Board to offer a remedy to those affected by this?

I just noticed this.  I would support Gorte.  He is a reasonable guy despite what you guys think of RAC.  Can we do this in conjunction with Rick.
I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, Rick

Gas Desk came in at 69.3, up approx. 16MM

Power Desk were quite, no noticeable change 

 << OLE Object: Microsoft Excel Chart >> 

5 day or 7 day for hub cash

will do.
 
The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?
 
I need to give you a task.  Figure out what I lost last week.
 
Also, why don't we have the rest of month henry hub swap up on weekends.

Hi John,
Attached is the marks we are using to mark our books as of Nov 15th.  Please
have your guys drop in your marks for the same day and send back to us.  This
should clear up 90% of our differences.
In addition, your help on some 3rd party book outs would help us reduce our
overall position size. We were working on one with Williams, when Kevin Presto
objected unless he was able to earn the bid/offer.  We would like to do the
following:

MS sells to Enron
Enron sells to Williams
Williams sells to MS

----100 mw of "Into SOCO" all at the current markt price.

Thanks for your help.

I am ok with Gorte being on the board of Mariner.  I agree that he is
reasonable.  He and I have always been able to work out differences of
opinion.  I will get with Teresa to work out the process.
Scott

just charge them 10 k.  It will add up.

Obviously not a priority, but some of the trading track guys are carrying $1,000,000 V@R overnight on the premise that a $10,000 penalty isn't going to hurt them if the market is down $.10.  Should we remedy this?

get me everyone's extentions so I can phone each tt person.

 << File: Trading Track  Rotations November 9th.xls >> 

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks,

Karen B.

We can find seats for them.

Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.

Brett Wiggs is taking El Paso through the motions this week on Electrobolt.  They seem keen on showing us a bid by next week.

Gents,

I thought that I would let you know that Rob Hemstock informed me last night that Murray Smith (Minister of Energy) got the PPA Division Regulation through Cabinet yesterday.  This essentially allows us to split the PPA with the remaining steps being a formality.  The Sundance B PPA will become the Sundance B3 and Sundance B4 PPAs within the next week.

Help out with Reliant.  

John

This is from Reliant's Cheif Risk Officer.  Please speak with Presto about facilitating these trades.  Also, Badeer was trying to ring positions out with MS and AEP and I told him not to do anything with AEP.

Bill

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

 -Original Message-----
highlights of my discussion with dave:
he wants an "opportunity" to originate out of the ees positions.  for example, the harrah's deal generated approximately $16 million relative to the mid, of which $4 went to ees.  he wants a chance to back this deal with his sourcing group.
he was unable to offer any definition around what the word "opportunity" means.  one interpretation of "opportunity" is that they get a head start, say three months to back a deal where neither west mm or west orig works on that deal for three months.  another interpretation is that west mm and west orig aren't allowed to talk to certain wholesale customers, for example the generators.  both of these are bad ideas.
i asked him why enron would want to keep its most talented origination resources on the sidelines for any period of time in order to let the kid brother (ees) have a "fair" chance at winning a deal.  i also asked him if he thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have developed in the west.  his answer was no.
i told dave that as the manager of the retail risk book i don't care who originates out of the transaction.  my thinking is that i give a copy of the harrah's contract to calger, foster, and delainey.  whoever gets us out first gets paid orig.  if people want to coordinate then that's fine.  if they want to compete head to head then that's fine.  speaking for portland, i would expect that west mm and orig would coordinate.
dave then said that he "gave" us the risk function and insinuated that we owed him something in return.  i indicated that i was willing to give it back and return to my simple life managing the west wholesale trading desk if that's what he wanted.  i think he took offense to that comment.
we hung up with no resolution.  dave called me back and proposed that we let anyone originate out of the position.  however, the origination dollars would go to ees profit center with the west mm or origination person getting the credit for that.  he talked about ees and the stock price and the billion dollar business.  my guys (i'm not speaking for chris here) don't care where the origination dollars go to so long as they get paid for bringing value.
i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for direction from you.

i'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward.  i would say that we agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals.  i would rather that the money for orig stay with whoever originated it.  i can live with a variety of outcomes.  i'll sit tight and wait for direction from you.

Delainey and I started initial discussions reguarding EES and the customers and products they plan to market.  These were initial discussions.   Dave is writing something up to send to me.  Before I agree on anything I will talk to all of you.  Some of the meeting that are happening may be a little premature.

Top analysts and associates - we have started ranking and will be finished today.

What is Beck's list and does it include IT or is it the list we did?

Power Scheduling too.
...some bonuses this week (with some reclaw plus penalty), putting aside yourselves, the guys we already took care of, Colwell, Headicke, Beck and my people, is there anyone else in EA you would like to make a case to pay?

Plan today is to get these names and proposed numbers pulled together for Greg this evening. Plan was to ask Colwell, Headicke etc., separately, if you want to review their names I can let you see them later tonight.

I plan to sit over in old building (16.71) and do this this afternoon noon till 5pm. You can either call me on my cell or have Jeanie walk list across.

we bought 15000 contracts and our VAR didn't fall.  Something is wrong with the model

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Kathy,
It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

Greg,

1.  We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.

2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. 

3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.

i didn't see 80 million of p/l on Friday. Did we book the deal?

Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below ar=
e the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:

As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts=
) and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is =
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduc=
t a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The pre-ra=
tings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and avail=
able for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a secondar=
y supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts feedba=
ck.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or Associates/An=
alysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  The Associa=
te and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the completed =
feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system is closed=
.  The more information that you can secure regarding your Associates/Analy=
sts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated correctly at the final=
 PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are unsure of the process, p=
lease contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or Shelly Butler at x3-4584=
 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the Associates/Anal=
ysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate this feedback in=
cluding your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at your business =
unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not conducting a pre-rat=
ing meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the rating you provide =
is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  Please contact the P=
EP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at x3-5230 if you are unab=
le to load this data yourself.  You should wait to provide feedback to your=
 Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have been made to avoid any =
confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final cross-calibration and =
may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are responsible for contacting th=
e PRC Representative listed above whom will be representing your Associates=
/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind that the more information y=
ou can provide, either verbal or written, will ensure that the final PRC is=
 a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received=
 your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received th=
is, please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the sys=
tem and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how=
 many people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving you=

ewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will also=
 be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the opportunit=
y to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you have added =
value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may hear from yo=
ur PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do not, we s=

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 20=

ysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be communicate=

I will not accept Amerex having the ability to execute over the phone.  Take this out of the deal or kill the deal.

There should be an appetite for increasing overall risk at Enron.  

David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to come. Rick

Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Hi Donna -

Ken said that the letter is fine.  Do you want to send us a list of the past 
Fathers and let us send the letters?

Let me know.

Rosie

Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.

Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference.  
Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.

Thank you again,

Tori L. Wells
Executive Secretary

Hi -

Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work.  I want to check 
with Mr. Lay before confirming.

Thanks.

Rosalee

 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:

  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm

 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten

Good morning, Kitty -

Ken Lay would like to have the Armada M306 series - "the first ultra portable 
notebook designed for the enterprise".  Ken said to go ahead and equip it 
with what you think it should have.

Please let me know when he can expect to receive it.  Thanks, Kitty.

Rosalee

  Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market,  I will
follow up with the consumer models.

The M300 series are the lightest and the E500's are the all in one but much
heavier.

RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th.

This is o.k. for Ken Lay, but we are changing to a more uniform address, so 
would likely be better to use kenneth.lay@enron.com.

Hi Mr. Pfeffer -

Dr. Lay asked me to tell you it's fine to proceed ahead with the 2001 date.  
It looks available on his schedule.  Please let me know if you need 
information from us.

Rosalee

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans
Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the
spring sunshine!
        I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am
Cordially yours,
Wally Pfeffer
Past-President, Leaders
College of Arts & Science

p.s.  hope you have a relaxing holiday weekend!

Hi Jeff and Valerie -

Sorry I hadn't responded sooner.  I was trying to get Mr. Lay out of town.  
Actually July 12 may work for him.  He is out of the office until June 12, 
but I'll try to ask him on his messages, so you'll have an answer before then.

Rosalee

Dear Ken,

Although I didn't have your response in hand, based on the responses I have
received, it seems that the best time for our next meeting is 3:00 - 5:30
p.m. on July 12 in New York City.

I do hope you will be able to make it.  Please let me know.

In any event, I'll be in touch with you soon to follow up on the first
meeting.

Best regards,
Jeff

Mr. Sinha -

Unfortunately, Ken Lay will not be able to attend the May 16 dinner.  He also 
has a conflict on September 28, the next meeting of the ISB Governing Board.

Rosalee

Dear Governing Board member,

This is just let you know that three of our Board members - Victor Menezes
(Citibank), PC Chatterjee (The Chatterjee Group), and Uday Khemka (the SUN
Group of Industries) - are co-hosting a fund-raising dinner for the ISB on
Tuesday, May 16, 2000 in New York. While I understand this is short notice,
in case you are in New York on that date and also available for dinner, we
will be delighted if you could join us. Rajat, Dean Jacobs, and a number of
other Board members and supporters will also be there.

Please block off the date on your calendar and let me know if it is
possible for you to attend. We will be sending out a formal invitation in a
few days. Also, do let us know if you have any suggestions on who we should
invite for the event.

Please also note that the next meeting of the ISB Governing Board will be
held in New York on Thursday, September 28 from about noon to 6PM.

With best regards,

Pramath Sinha

From Ken Lay -

Ken said "Get word back to Lucie that 6 or 7, but would prefer 6 and add an 
extra special 7th meeting during the year if it's needed".

Thanks.

Rosalee

Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.

?

Ken,

Received communications from the Texas Department of Economic Development and 
the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.  Both would like to invite PM Vajpayee 
to Houston during his U.S. visit in September.  The last time that we had a 
PM here was in '94 with PM Rao.  I would like to support this action and 
would recommend that we draft a letter for your signature.  Have discussed 
same with Joe Sutton and have his support.

Dick

Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.  However, I had a thought.  Why 
don't you draft what you'd like him to say and then he can make changes to it 
as he wishes.  That would really be helpful.

Thanks.

Jeffrey McClellan@ECT
04/28/2000 03:21 PM
Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the "Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards."  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional "brown 
bags" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff
Jeffrey McClellan
04/12/2000 05:10 PM
Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the "Cougars @ Enron".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at "Frontier Fiesta".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Rosalee

Dear Ken,

We are in the process of trying to arrange a conference call with you on
either Tuesday or Wednesday of next week to discuss the paper which is
attached.  ( I'm sending it along now so that you have some time to look at
it.)

We will be doing this by conference call and once we set a time to talk with
you, will give you the number to call.  (To set up a time, your office can
contact my assistant, Valerie Petersen either at valerie.petersen@yale.edu
or at 203-432-6035.)

Look forward to speaking with you next week.

Best regards,

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad 
will have, so hopefully that will work.

would really like to attend if possible.

Best of luck!!!!!

Hi Corey -

My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
thinking I know anything about baseball.

Look forward to hearing from you!!

Love,

Aunt Rosie

Yes, indeed.

Hi Terry -

Ken Lay said that he would really like an update and more detail about the 
"Digital Divide" and TFA.  He is attending the Fortune Battle Royal and said 
this fits right in with the subject.  He will be leaving for Washington 
tomorrow night.

Thanks.

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Hi Sherri -

Ken said that he will pledge $750.00 - $5 per mile.  Sally will pass on to 
Holly in the Foundation office to prepare a check to get to you.

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Well, I know this is terribly short notice, but Ken does have a meeting with 
Tom DeLay on Monday morning at 9:30 a.m.  (I know that's half a day gone for 
Joe if he's in town), but he is coming in to discuss RMIC (Republican 
Majority Issues Committee).  Are there specific things that Ken needs to be 
briefed on?  I know that Steve did recommend that Ken have this meeting.

Thanks very much.

in the office on Thursday.

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Rosie

Rebecca McDonald@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
02/29/2000 11:51 AM
Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca

Hi John -

Ken said that given he will be in town on March 15, he will plan to attend 
the meeting also. By way of this e-mail, I'll check with Joe's office to see 
what time it's scheduled.

Thanks.

Rosie

Ken and Joe
 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.

Barbara, I have advised our Washington office that Mr. Lay will be on this 
conference call at 3:30.  Just let us know the number for him to call.  Thank 
you.

We need to schedule a telephonic Board meeting the afternoon of February 24.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Keith

Dick, I would be happy to do this.

During our previous executive forums, interest was expressed in holding a 
forum in London for executives who have participated in the Executive Program 
and are based in the UK.  Mary Clark indicates that you will be in London the 
end of this month for an employee meeting.  Following are the names of the 
Enron Europe executives who have participated in the Executive Program to 
date:

Kevin Beasley
Eric Gadd
Eric Gonzales
Matthew Scrimshaw
Brian Stanley
Steve Young
Gregory Cardenas

They will be receiving invitations to the Executive Forums scheduled here in 
Houston over the next few months.  But, I would be happy to invite them to a 
special Executive Forum, specifically for them, in London while you are 
there, your schedules permitting.  Please let me know if you would like me to 
try to arrange this.

Russell, I think it will be Kenneth.Lay@Enron.com.  Do we capitalize all the 
words, but com?  I noticed that mine is Rosalee.Fleming@Enron.com.  I had 
sent something to my home e-mail address.  This may not be a good test as I 
am sending it from my home computer, from his mail-box, but not from his 
computer.  Oh, well, we'll see!!

Rosie

Hi Liz -

Your Dad said to tell you that it would be fine for Elizabeth to review the 
document.  Her secretary told me that her e-mail address is:  
elabano@enron.com.  I'm copying her on this in case you have any difficulty 
with sending it.

Rosie

Elizabeth Lay <lizard_ar@yahoo.com> on 02/09/2000 12:52:35 PM
Dad,
I've drafted a Interim Construction Financing document
for the loan we previously discussed. However, I would
like to have it reviewed by Elizabeth Labonowski
(assuming she has handled some of your loans and real
estate interests previously) if you don't mind.
Unfortunately, since my contract experience is
generally in Take or Pay or join venture projects, it
is lengthier than you wanted.
Please let me know if I can have the go ahead to
contact Elizabeth and if you could have Rosalee send
me Elizabeth's e-mail address, that would be very
helpful.
Thanks,
Love,
Elizabeth

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.

Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at

Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."

Minister's hotel to meet with him.

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay

Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
"What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?"

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Sharon Lay <sharon@travelpark.com> on 01/12/2000 07:16:42 PM
Hello John,
I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it
was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

Mr. Lay said that he would like for you to accept service on his behalf.

Robert_Donohoo@i2.com on 05/09/2001 10:32:34 AM
Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
"tag-along" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks

I just wanted to follow up to make sure that all the arrangements for Mr
Lay's trip to Paris are in order.  In particular, I wanted to make sure that
the materials for the FORUM, including the VIP pass for his car and driver
made it to you.  Please let me know if not, and I will arrange to have the
materials left at his hotel pending his arrival.

I have been in touch with Mr Bradley on input to Mr Lay's remarks, and all
seems in order on that front.

Thanks again for your help.

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -

I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. 
and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend.

Thank you.

Mr. Pershing, I am still confused about the exact date of the panel!!

Rosalee

Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Good morning, Valerie.  I don't believe we did get the e-mail yesterday!!  
Please resend.

I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you with a revision of the
paper.

Attached please find a revised summary by Tim Koller.  We hope it reflects
well the discussion of our previous meeting. Before the next meeting, it is
our intention to send along the longer discussion paper that would mirror
this summary.  I suggest this next meeting take place as a conference call
at one of the following times.  Please indicate with an "X" in the boxes
next to the proposed dates which dates are good for you.

               Monday, November 20, 5 p.m. EST     [ X  ]

               Monday November 27, 6 pm EST        [ X  ]

We would like to get everyone's views in advance of this conference call,
either in writing or by phone.  Please indicate below what your preference
would be.  If a call is preferred, Valerie Petersen will contact your

Dear Steve:

 The Galleo mobile multimedia communicator looks very interesting.  As you 
may know, I am on the Compaq Computer board.  They have a very successful 
product that is somewhat similar referred to as the iPAQ.  They also have 
other wireless machines which I use.  I think for the time being I do not 
necessarily need to add one more.  But I do appreciate you thinking of me.

I appreciate the brief e-mail concerning The Continental article.  It turned 
out to be a nice article.

I have been in and out of London in recent weeks but not there for any 
extended stay.  I believe my next extended stay in London will be this Fall.  
I will attempt to come by and check your products out.

My very best to you.

Ken

Privet! Kenneth

I have just finished reading the article in Continental ,hence the Russian
greeting .

You look in good health , or is it the skills of the make-up artist ,the
former I hope .

Will you be making a stop in England ?.

Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting?

Rosie

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike 

John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer.

Rosie

I would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive 
Committee meeting on May 7, 2001.  Please forward your comments or questions 
by Tuesday, May 1, 2001 so that I can extend the offer by Wednesday, May 2, 
2001.

You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume.

Regards,

John Lavorato

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Dr Kenneth L. Lay

Enron

Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum

Good morning, Jean - 

I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for 
Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he 
would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:  
natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Hi Mary Hope -

Ken would like to have the meeting late afternoon on May 24th, if 
possible.    He thinks your suggestion of Steering Committee members to join 
the meeting are great.

Thanks.

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Dear, Mr. Lay:

I have taken the liberty of submitting your name as reference to
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. I am part of a team
which is bidding to manage a $350 million OPIC African
Infrastructure Fund. I will serve as the Managing General Partner
of the fund.

A representative of OPIC will be calling you over the next
several days to ask you about my personal character and my
business experience, as you are familiar with them.

I would appreciate it if you would accept the call from OPIC.

Thank you very much,

Frank Savage

Dear Kelly:

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr=
on=20
become involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in=
=20
Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20
Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=
r=20
in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=
=20
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
 =20
Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=
val=20
of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=
O=018=20
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=
=20
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=
en.=20
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=
=20
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=
=20
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=
=20
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=
=20
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=
ur=20
business.

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

Mr. Lay,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was=
=20
this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20
received free air time of "Enron" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular=
=20
as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?=
=20
Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as=
=20
AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of "The=
=20
New Power Company" in the retail consumer/viewer's venue. It would also giv=
e=20
me someone to "root" for.

Houston's Future capital campaign.

Tuesday, May 1, 12:30 p.m.
Houston Club -- President's Room

This meeting time would be directly after the monthly board meeting of
the Greater Houston Partnership.  No speaker is scheduled during lunch
for the Partnership's board meeting.  The Partnership board meeting will
be adjourned and the Finance Committee Meeting group will lunch/meet in

Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Ken -
?
Child Advocates'? 9th annual "Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic" is honoring?
Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are 
putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the 
event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him 
that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those 
being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve 
Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully 
you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would 
agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It 
probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to 
say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, 
because the event is only a month away  (May 19th).
?
FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year 
contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and 
Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family.

Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate 
it.

The proposal is totally satisfactory to Ken Lay.

Rosalee

In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k
Napier - 155k
Fox - 125k
Milton - 100k
Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to
CFO)
Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September)
Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant)

If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne
or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a
unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you!

Hi Dr. Pershing -

Monday or Tuesday?

Thanks.

Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled "Fuelling Sustainable
Development".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any "last-minute" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Ken Lay said to let you know he does sign off on this draft.

Rosalee

  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

Good morning, Liz -

I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak 
with you when you have a chance to call.  

Rosie

p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was 
such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office 
and leave in time to vote!!

Elizabeth Lay <lizard_ar@yahoo.com> on 11/06/2000 09:13:26 AM
Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,

Toby
?
Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Hi Mr. Reed -

I left a message on Thursday evening for Rosemarie, but was out Friday, so 
was too busy to follow up today, but having said all that, Ken Lay wanted me 
to let you know that he would like to have the TFA board meeting at the Enron 
building.  Please let me know if that will be possible. 

Rosalee

Gentlemen,

Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter
from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously
pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known
all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in
communities across the US.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono
legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen.
THANKS JACK!!!

On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie
Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All
Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University
Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take
place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the
context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference "Digital
Divide: A Call to Action".  Each of you will receive an complimentary
invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a
CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

Anne Culver <aculver@houston.org> on 03/25/2001 03:47:18 PM

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

CALL TO ACTION

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=

intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

State of the World Report

From the thinning of the Arctic sea ice to the invasion of the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus, the Worldwatch Institute's State of the
World 2001 shows how the economic boom of the last decade has damaged
natural systems.   The report takes a fresh look at the most difficult
challenge the world faces: how to build an environmentally sustainable

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

Alliance Associates Honored with Awards

Many Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards
Ceremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the
Department of Energy.  Additionally, the Industrial Energy Technology
Conference (IETC) has selected Alliance Associate Owens Corning for a
prestigious award for outstanding contributions to industrial energy
efficiency and environmental stewardship.

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching
modules, and lesson plans on a variety of energy, electrical safety, energy

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter
Publisher and Editor-in-Chief
www.TheGlobalist.com

Also this week:

JAPAN -- DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 55!
During the course of its decade-long economic malaise, Japan
has tried just about every trick in the book to get its economy
growing again. We may have found the answer -- but be warned,
those over the age of 55 may not like it!
http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-21-01.shtml

CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY
Why does China have an embassy on the tiny Caribbean island
of St. Lucia -- an island 8,000 miles away from Beijing and with which
it has few economic or political ties?
http://www.theglobalist.com/nor/gdiary/2001/03-19-01.shtml

Coming Friday: A New Globalist Bookshelf Feature
ROBERT KAPLAN ON THE TURKEY-ISRAEL AXIS
Turkey is in the midst of an economic crisis -- and Israel's relations
with the Palestinians have steadily deteriorated. So what do these
countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?

25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as

ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.

REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.

AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

*****MARKET ANALYIS REPORT NEWS*****

ALGERIAN OIL AND GAS REPORT
Approximately 90% of Algeria's crude oil exports go to Western Europe, with
Italy as the main market followed by Germany and France. Algeria accounts
for one-quarter of EU gas imports. With the de-regulation and liberalisation

demands of Iberia and the Eastern Mediterranean Basin. This will depend upon
the degree to which foreign investment can be attracted.

in Algeria, and the prime and potential markets for Algerian energy
products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis
on
* All major oil and gas field/projects.
* Southern European gas demand forecasts
* Corporate Directory
* BP Amoco's natural gas strategy

The Report is essential reading for exploration and production, business

sector. For further information please visit

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan
* Dr Ranald Spiers, Regional Director Middle East & Africa, National Power
Plc
* Steve Wildman, Commercial Director, Alstom Gas Turbines
* Tom Thomason, Project Manager, InterGen
* Daniel J. Meier, Area Sales Manager, ABB High Voltage Technologies
* Dr Thomas Stauffer, International Oil and Finance Consultant (Formerly
with M.I.T)

MENA Power takes place on 23rd & 24th April 2001 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel,
Dubai.  The full conference programme is available at

http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

Rosie,

I didn't realize that Ken's name was on my distribution list.  I guess I 
inadvertantly struck the name next to Mark Lay.  Sorry.  I will delete it.

Barbara

Hi Barbara -  does Ken Lay need to be on these e-mails?

Rosie

Just a reminder that your portfolio company presentations are due on Monday 
3/19th.  Gene will need to get his copies by mail, so please make sure Lilia 
has a copy to include in the mailing paket to him by 4PM on Monday.  If you 
are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can 
get your presentation to Gene.

The first drafts were a good start.  Most, however, read more like a pitch  
[Paige, Barbara]  than an assessment/evaluation.  As you make your revisions, 
keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak 
over the weekend.  I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we 
can arrange a time to speak.  I will be generally available by phone Saturday 
morning through early afternoon.

Thanks,
Barbara

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible
for co-ordinating Mr Lay's participation at the May IEA Ministerial session.
From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Good morning, Michelle -

Ken Lay said that he would be happy to be the opening keynote speaker at the 
kick off luncheon on Wednesday, April 25, 2001.

Sorry for the delay, but at least we are sure he wants to do it.

Rosalee

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

Dear Nicolas:

I am pleased that you found the Cancun meeting to be a good experience.  My 
wife and I also thought if was a very enjoyable couple of days.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in 
Mexico, you should contact either Jaime Alatorre or Max Yzaguirre.  Either 
one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able 
to work together.

Best regards,

I would like to know more about your activities in our country. If it is

Hi Mr. Stelzer l-

I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your 
outline.  He has a huge stack of mail he hasn't gotten to yet.  Hopefully, by 
tomorrow, he will have seen it.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Stelzer@aol.com on 03/15/2001 12:13:57 PM
Will do -- and I assume I can go ahead with all of the suggestions in my
outline. Right? Also, now that you are free of Blockbuster, should you and
Rupert get together again?

Thanks, Anabella, as I couldn't figure out why Mr. Lay received it.

Hi Tom - this would be good as Ken Lay will not be able to attend next week.  
He will be out of the country.

Rosalee

Thank you for making yourself available this afternoon. We want to apprise
you of recent developments and our planned responses.  The regular Board
Meeting is scheduled for next week. This may not be required in view of the
discussions we'll have this afternoon.  We'll confirm this afternoon whether
the Board Meeting is required.

I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Stelzer@aol.com on 03/12/2001 09:47:35 AM
Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: "A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels."

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: "Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes."

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  "The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

Widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist abandons "na<ve" search for truth

The widow of murdered Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze told how she has
despaired of ever uncovering the truth about his death.

Myroslava Gongadze said her "endless moves" to find out what happened to her
husband were "na<ve".

The journalist's headless body was found near Kiev. Gongadze was a fierce
critic of the Ukrainian government, which has been implicated in his death.

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
"traitors" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: "People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country."

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: "We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"

BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
below the hype".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
"misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel."

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
getting rid of staff".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share."

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group."

Media Guardian says happy birthday to Rupert Murdoch

Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch has just turned 70 and to celebrate Media
Guardian has created an online tribute.

In its birthday special "Seven Ages of Murdoch", the site tells Murdoch's
life story in seven animated cartoons. Its online birthday card has Murdoch
cutting a cake in the shape of the globe.

Tributes have been sent by The Telegraph's proprietor Conrad Black and
advertising chiefs Lord Saatchi and Sir Martin Sorrell. Says former Pearson
MD Frank Barlow: "Whether you love him or hate him, you can't help but
admire his achievements which are immense indeed." Visitors can send their
own tributes to the site's editor.

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
consider me for a Management trainee position in your
esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my
resume.

Sincerely,

Asad Rashid

Thanks, Michelle.  This will help, I think.

Rosalee

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

Kenneth L. Lay
 Chairman of the Board
 ENRON

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take
one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and
also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish
to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest
a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate
your availability by preference (#1, #2).

(#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

(#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and
title to appear in the report?

Many thanks,

Jeff Garten

Jim:
It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=
n,=20
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=
ds.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=
ow=20
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=
 to=20
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=
=20
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=
d=20
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=
=20
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=
=20
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20
office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als=
o=20
identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=
=20
language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=
e=20
if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=
ng=20
else that I can do to assist you.

Ken Lay

Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=
=20
in Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands

David Parquet, Vice-President

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.
Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=
=20
paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).

The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=
e:

=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=
cularly=20
in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=
=20
resources.
reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20
electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =
in=20
the state.
fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=
k=20
of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20
customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=
=20
responding.=20

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=
=20
excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=
=20
summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=
=20
that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=
s=20
that amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20
directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20
control systems that would support load curtailment implementation.

Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=
cle:=20
SB27X
The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=
re=20
customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=
=20
service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=
=20
customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=
e=20
prohibition against Direct Access.

Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=
=20
direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=
=20
customer migration. =20

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=
=20
the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=
nt=20
is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20
condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20
therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20
function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20
non-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=
ia=20
should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =
in=20
which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=
=20
of utility load.

Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =
vehicle:=20
AB18X
Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=
. =20
In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20
imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=
=20
and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=
ia=20
State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=
ed=20
period of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=
e=20
in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20
participate in that market.

California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=
=20
series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20
increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=
=20
=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=
ould=20
amortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=
d. =20

Could you please e-mail me an invitation, the file you sent does not allow 
you to print.  Although Mr. Lay will not be in the office this day I would 
like to let him know about Howard Martin's retirement.

Thanks

Michael -

Ken Lay said to tell you this is fine.

Rosalee

Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Kevin Hannon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 11/29/2000 08:51:27 AM
Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-

Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.

            Nov.2 email text

We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.

The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.

You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  

We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.

The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       

The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.

I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.

Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.

Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without 
Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very 
successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to 
bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.

Rosalee

Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk 
to Steve (he is traveling, but said he is trying to get in touch with you).  
Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe

Here it is!!  Have a great day!!  Stay warm.

Good morning -

I was out during the timeframe that this was sent, but Ken Lay did not give 
it back to us.  He is traveling now and totally inaccessible (on vacation) 
during the time of the meeting, so he will not be participating.

Rosalee

Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.
     McKinsey & Company

Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

Hi Calvin - just to let you know that Ken is going to be traveling until 
10/3, but I will print this out for him to see.

Several, months ago Limas Jefferson wrote you a letter requesting your 
support for business opportunities at Enron.  That letter was subsequently 
forwarded to Cindy Olson and me.  As you can see from the note below, we were 
able to arrange for Jefferson & Associations to partner with Compaq on the 
Windows 2000 Project.  You commented on Mr Jefferson's letter that you would 
consider meeting with him.  I can be of assistance in coordinating a meeting 
between the two of you.   Please advise.

FYI - Mr. Jefferson had a difficult time reaching me because my phone number 
changed when my office moved to 3AC.

Cynthia, Ken said to tell you that he told David Sokol we would probably 
oppose it.

Rosie

Cynthia Sandherr
09/08/2000 04:49 PM

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. 

Hi Nancy -

Ken asked me to tell you that you can absolutely use him as a reference.

Good morning Ken,
Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being the "Honorary Chair" for 
the Cougars@Enron golf tournament to be held on March 21, 2001.  I enjoyed 
meeting you at the "Enron Excellence Awards" presentation and genuinely 
appreciate your support.  When we spoke, you said that you may not be able to 
play in the tournament.  I certainly understand, but if you are available to 
play (or make an appearance at the dinner afterward), it would most 
beneficial to our outcome.  Please let me know if you are available.

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial 
relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues 
for the country's main industries.

Please consult our website, http://www.weforum.org/mexico, where information

Hi Mr. Ramsay -

In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the 
Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that 
he would be delighted to participate.

We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board 
has its meeting.

Rosalee 

Mr. Lay responded that he is unable to attend.  I know that you already have 
that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.

Rosalee Fleming

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla

Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee

Dear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider 
other dates.

Rosalee

pway@wayholding.com on 08/16/2000 03:25:57 PM
Ken, I understand that you are trying to clear your sch. to speak at the
River Oaks Breakfast Club on Oct. 26.  I hope it works out because I always
hear what is going on at Enron.  Peter

Mr. Hines -

To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options 
market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff 
Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.

Rosalee

Jeff_Hines@hines.com on 08/28/2000 06:05:38 PM
I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.

Hi Mr. Moore -

I did hear back from Mr. Lay.  Will September 11 at 3:00 p.m. work for you?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.

Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, 
I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?

I seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)

I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take 
awhile.

Hi Mr. Yergin -

I just wanted to make sure that you knew that Ken does plan to do this.  He 
did talk to Governor Knowles.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Dan Yergin <dyergin@CERA.com> on 08/15/2000 11:22:38 AM
Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan 

Amy, you are a treasure!!!  I know you'll be a treasure of a Mom, too!!  But 
I'll miss you!!

Hi!

Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
own stationary/invitations company.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community 
Relations needs, Elyse Kalmans is heading up the department.  She can be 
reached at 713.853.0565.

Thanks!

Hi Mr. Lewis -

Ken asked me to send you an e-mail stating that he would be happy to submit 
your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please 
send him a current bio.  

Thanks.

Rosalee

<Bill_Lewis@mckinsey.com> on 11/28/2000 03:43:58 PM
Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific 
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to  
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for 
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn 
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.  
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise 
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear 
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out 
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an 
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron 
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.

 

Hi Mr. Moore -

I'm sorry that we didn't discuss dates this morning as Mr. Lay is on vacation 
until September 5.  As that will be his first week back after being out for 
several weeks, it is already pretty booked up. 

I will certainly share this e-mail with him.  Is it possible to update Mr. 
Lay on the progress of the Committee to Encourage Corporate Philanthropy by 
e-mail?  Another thought might be to see if our Executive Vice President of 
Human Resources, Cindy Olson,  would be available to meet with you on August 
28 or 29.  Ms. Olson is in charge of Enron's Community Relations Department.

Please advise.

Rosalee

I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the 
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy 
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen 
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in 
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.
?
I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your 
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name 
just a few.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
?
P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on 
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.

Mike, Ken is not attending.  Thanks.

The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.

If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
if you desire.

Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be 
rescheduled.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

I was really disappointed you and Lavonne were not able to make the Rees

Our broadband business is doing great.  Just a few days ago, we announced a 
video-on-demand service we will be providing with Blockbuster.  It has 
created a lot of interest.

In general, my family is doing very well.  Linda and I now have six grandkids 
(four new ones since the first of the year) plus Elizabeth's wedding.  Let's 
stay in touch.

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

Hi Jaime -

Thanks for the information about the dinner.  Ken said that he would be 
flying from Aspen to New York (or Washington, if that's the city).  He said 
he would very much like to meet with you for 30 - 45 minutes before the 
dinner for a briefing.  

Thanks.

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

Mr. Christman:

Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in 
France, the format looks wonderful.  Unfortunately, Dr. Lay has calendar 
conflicts and will be unable to participate.

Great--and I will be inspired with my draft of his remarks.

Rosie, could you call the phone number on the invitation, ask for Herb 
Bateman (he is the director), and tell him of the commitment?

I am out of town and do not have their number, and they called me wondering 
about Ken's decision last Friday.

Thanks,

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
of the event.

Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

Ken 

Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken

Ken said "John, this looks fine to me.  Why not send it to George for his 
consideration".

Rosalee for Ken Lay

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Dear Mr. Lay:
             My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate
for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the
winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.
Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan

the MDA Beach Bowl.

Thanks.

Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things." (Peter 
Drucker)

Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's 
Visions & Values. 

An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was 
recently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & 
unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good 
feedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, 
suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific 
behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to 
modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to 
find another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), "I want 
avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget 
this."  

To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about 
Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, 
and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to 
Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was 
decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when 
things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented 
professional more time.  She writes:

...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in 
which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 
interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received 
answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without 
acknowledgment of any sort.

I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened 
to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 
months to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...

Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There 
are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & 
discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from 
HR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line 
with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  

Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to 
honor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to 
mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to 
assistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put 
out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not 
blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I 
remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  "believing your own 
baloney."  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but "believing 
baloney" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked 
for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.

Jeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening 
too, but seeing is believing.

Respectfully submitted,

Betty Alexander

Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=

Our street address is 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas 77002.  For your 
information, Dorothy is no longer in our office.  Tori Wells is a new contact 
person, in addition to me.

Thanks.

Dear Rosalie/Dorothy:

Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading
materials for the Business Leaders Dialogue in Aspen, Colorado (July 27-30).
We have noticed that our mailing address for Mr. Lay is a p.o. box.
Unfortunately, our express courier will not ship to a p.o. box.  Is there a
street address that you can provide for Mr. Lay so that we can express mail
him his Dialogue materials?

Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Godwin Carmona
Program Coordinator
Aspen ISIB

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.

Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.

Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.

I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.

Sincerely,

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a "One Enron" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.

Rick:

As I am sure you have read by now, Jeff Skilling has chosen to leave Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.

I want to assure you that Jeff's departure will in no way affect the relationship that Enron has with Microsoft and more specifically MSN.  I have been briefed on the MSNIA project, by my team,  and they assure me that we are on track to meet your Broadband Internet Access roll-out plans in early October.  I look forward to getting more personally involved with Microsoft to help insure that our ongoing relationship and partnership continues to mature and flourish.

I will contact you in the near future to discuss with you this transition.  In the meantime,  if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact my office.

Hasan:

I fully understand and agree with your comments.  Unfortunately, I did not see the "Travel Secruity Update" e-mail before it was sent out.  We will do better.

Ken

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.  

Hi Michelle -
 
It looks as though this will work quite easily now as the breakfast Ken originally had scheduled will not take place.  I received word from Sue Landwehr that it will be cancelled as it was Republican Governors and they will not now be here.  We'll coordinate an exact time tomorrow.
 
Thanks.
 
Rosie

Dear Mr. Lay, 

I understand that Cindy Olson talked with you about the harassment prevention training scheduled over the next few weeks.  In past classes, a senior-level business person has emphasized that harassment is not tolerated and is not consistent with Enron's values.   

For this set of training classes, the team asked if you could deliver that message via videotape.  Cindy told me that your answer is "yes." 

I understand that you are scheduled to record an unrelated video on Thursday morning, and that it might be possible to tape this message at the end of that session.  Would that work with your schedule?  If so, I will provide you with talking points and a script.  If another time is better for you, let me know.

Thanks for your help!

Michelle Cash

                   This letter is to ask to please check into the

irregularities that are going on in your company Pro-Caribe in Puerto Rico.

In this company there seems to be preference for two employees which are the

favorites between managment, mr. Roberto Aponte and mr. Rafael Medina.  The

two employees do not work rotating shifts they have a steady day job make

more money than the other employees overtime is always given to them a one

our break while  the other employees have to sit back and are not able to do

anything about it because if they do they will be put on suspension and their

company motto is ," If you dont like it quit".  All the recognitions and cash

prices go to these two individuals they always come out employee of the year

or the trimestrial plant operator and then again there not plant operators.

There is no opportunity for other employees to advance at this site because

of the discrimination and abuses  going on towards them and which is clearly

evident.   Actually these two individuals hold the post that when there is an

incoming ship they have to attend to it but lately this ship is not coming in

as ofthen as it used to and yet this individualsstill earn the extra money

without lifting a finger.   Some of the priviliges they have is that they do

not have to work rotating shifts and   they are off on holidays  meanwhile

the other employees have to work the rotating shifts, work holidays and make

less money.  Please mr. Loy it is in your hands to make justice for the other

employees who work hard and yet they dont seem to be appreciated.  All

promotions and recognitions are based on the fact that the two employees have

bought their way to their current positions by bringing in gifts and taking

their employers out to dinner.  This action which i believe is wrong because

it is just like taking a bribe.   Once again mr. Loy i ask for your help and

hope you will be able to investigate and be able to straighten out this

situation.  I have witness these events and i do not like any type of

discrimination i leave it in your hands.

Hi Mrs. Jamail -

Ken and Linda Lay would very much like to attend the dinner on September 12.  Will you please send me the details or phone me at 713-853-6773?

Thanks.

Rosalee Fleming
Assistant to Ken Lay

Dear  Ken, 
 
This  is the invitation that Harry was speaking to us about on the plane last  night.  Please let me know how to respond.  Note that they did not  mention a starting time.  Rosie may need to call Lee Jamail for  details.  Love, Linda
 

Dear Pam:

Thank you for your e-mail of August 15th.  It is always a pleasure to hear from former employees.  Thank you also for calling attention to instances which, on the surface, do not appear to be representative of our expectations of Enron leadership.

Part of our continuous improvement involves an on-going review of our management and the diversity of styles therein.  True, not everyone is agreeable to Enron's culture or the many different management styles at Enron.  We do, however, expect all of our employees - not just management - to adhere to our core values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.  These values become even more significant as we continue to grow and expand our scope of business, and more critical as we become a more culturally diverse workforce.

We enjoy our status as one of the best places in America to work according to Fortune and other sources thanks in part to our willingness to examine our organization and make needed change.  Our employee surveys, belief in open communication, and exit interview process for employees choosing to leave Enron are examples of our efforts to seek out feedback and scrutinize the way we do business.  Your feedback will help play a role in that process.

Sincerely,

Ken Lay

Mr. Lay:

Mr. Lay, the I am not writing this in malice but in hopes that it helps get
Enron back the way it used to treat their employees and makes it the number
one employer of choice again.  I hope you can get back the feeling that I
had when I first started there and get the stress level down in your
organization for the sake of your employees.

I am a former employee who worked at Enron for 10 years - my husband was,
at one time, in charge of A/P.  My one big disappointment was that I never
got to meet you.    During that time, I made a lot of friends who I
continue to see from time to time.  I left last year and have missed the
company since I left but would not contemplate coming back unless several
people have been replaced.  (Joannie Williamson and Sheri Sera know my
story.)

I "knew" Jeff but I don't think he knew me by name, only by sight, even
though I worked in ENA when it only had 400 employees with 3 of us in HR.
He was NOT what I would call a people person!  Unless you were in an upper
level position, he did not take the time to find out your name.  (Ron Burns
is still one of my favorite people because of his talent with people - we
need more like him in the business world!)

As you can see, I am now working for a competitor and since I work in HR, I
continually run into former Enron workers who have also left - most of
their reasons are the same.

It is not that they have lost faith in Enron as a company but because of
they way they were treated by their managers.  During the last 5 years I
was there, I noticed a change in direction in the way employees were
treated by upper management - and upper management was getting away with
it.  Not only were they getting away with it, these people were being
rewarded for this behavior.  I have heard stories of lower level employees
being screamed at and in one instance, one of the VP's who was brought down
from Canada was heard in his office screaming and pounding his telephone on
his desk.  Heaven only knows how he treats his subordinates.  Believe me,
the way employees are treated at Enron is being talked about on the streets
of Houston and on the different college campuses.  You might also at some
point take the time to find out why so many good people have left the HR
community at Enron and it is not because they wanted to.

I don't know if you will see this, but I hope so.  Good luck on bringing
Enron back to way it was - I still own stock!!

Thanks for listening...

Pam Allison

Christie,this may not go to you, but wasn't sure if it should be Misha Siegel.  Will copy Misha also.  This may just not be something we would do anyway.

i have to go to a dinner tonight, but i will meet up with you guys at the 
grasshopper if you want.  we need to check that joint out.  call me on my 
cell and we will hit it.

didn't you go to grasshopper last night

was it any good

let's meet up at grasshopper

thanks for the xmas card.  that was real nice.  

i would but i am going to the spa

whatever gillette.  i will be feeling all loose and relaxed while i am 
whooping it up at the grasshopper tonight.

everyone who is anyone will be there.  

i will be the prettiest at the grasshopper

meeting up with boone and luis and whoever.  if the broker goes we will just 
get some free drinks.  date went well.  i had a good time.

did you just get that reply?

are you going out this weekend?  i think you said you had a wedding to go to 
or something?     were you hurting on wednes morning?

i thought that you were going

yeah baby!   that place is gonna rock

i don't know.  i am going to golf sunday morning at the woodlands which is 
very nice.  i don't want to be real hung over, but i still might go out.  
tonight i am definately going out.

you were right about my flight time.  i will see you at the passenger pickup.

i felt fine.  i woke up at 5am to work out.  i guess you are just a candy 
ass.  just kidding.  i have a dinner to go to tonight with some broker then i 
am heading downtown.  i will give you a call this weekend.  have fun at the 
wedding.

i tried to call yesterday, but you guys were not home.  i did speak with 
grandma and grandpa.  grandpa sounded really bad.  i am a little worried 
after speaking with him.  he sounded to tired to even speak.  i think i need 
to get out to phoenix to see them soon.

give me a call from dc when you get a chance.

love matt

i felt like a champ on sat

i didn't do all those shots with boone

Derek-

Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would 
not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
Due to high inventory on the PG&E system, any new nominations placed in the
Intraday 1 cycle will be cut to zero for gas day 05/11/2001.  System
constraints will be held to Evening scheduled volumes.

If you have any questions, please call the Gas Scheduling Hotline at (415)
973-2424 or the CGT Helpline at 1 (800) 343-4743 and then press 2 for
scheduling assistance.

CGT Schedulers
PG&E - California Gas Transmission

we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 
11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are 
going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal 
goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank 
wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

did you call for me at work today?

did you call me today at work

i will be in town fri afternoon.  tell max and  i  will see you guys either

i wasn't that drunk on saturday.  i was just joking.  i felt great on 
saturday.  like a champ.  people get married younger than you?  wow.  what 
the hell do they do if they get married that early?  

i had to wake up early on sunday so i didnt feel like going.  were there a 
lot of hotties?

i will be here on fri night, but sat i am going to tim's engagement party.  i 
think i will be out on fri.

i am here dog

yeah, paincourtville, la.  i don't know where the fuck that is.

i will be watching.  have fun

dont try to play it off.  you just cant spell.

not me.  i wont get a vette unless i am 50, single & have a mustache.  if i 
need to pick up the young cheesey babes when i am old i will get one.  i 
never heard of that movie.

nothing.  i am pissed.  i got out of a position too early and i would have 
made a killing.

i will be home fri afternoon. i will see you and max fri or sat.  

i can't make that

how is everything going?  are you guys staying cool down there.  i know it 
has been hot.  i will try to call soon.

i didn't take profits.  got slaughtered today. i had a great month last 
month, i just need to get out of this hole this month.  at least it is the 
first.  i will talk to you sunday.

i have to be in denver that weekend for a family function.  what about labor 
day?  we could go that fri & sat night and fly back sun.  we would have 
monday off to recover.  lsu is playing some schmeg team any way.  there will 
be more cougars in vegas over labor day also.  cougars are good back up plan 
at the end of the night.  

25th is ideal.
Lenny why can't you make this date?
Jacques, let me know when you have something definite so I can get a flight.
Al are you going to come?
Keep in touch.
Brian

what is up monkey?  things are  good in houston.  i still have a gambling 
problem so i am gonna try to go to vegas if i can.  are you in california 
still.  i bet you have a 15 year old girlfriend huh?  you and mark chumura 
hitting the prom parties.  drinking cold beer and getting hot pussy is still 
what it is about.  even though we work you need to get those essentials.  
they are like air.  we did it right in college when we were running those chi 
- o's.  you should try to get to h-town one weekend and we will run some 
cougars.

cougars= old women that pray on young men.

cougars love me here.  give me a shout some time.  713-853-7176.  good to 
hear from you.

labor day is the working man's holiday.  since most of us work we should 
celebrate the holiday (and jacques and val's weddings) that weekend in 
vegas.  

I can't make it either on the those dates. I am going to Miami for my 
birthday. I like Lenhart's idea about Labor Day. Let me know.

Nick

saints suck.  tigers play the louisiana school for the deaf.  you wont miss 
anything.  i thought you were a 49ers fan?

No way.  Labor Day=Tigers opener + Saints opener.  Stick to the 25th.

Labor day is the best b/c we have a day to recoup.

CKL

i just spoke with wayne gonzalin and he said that there is a rodney 
impersonator there the same weekend.  tickets are only $4.95 and that 
includes an all you can eat hot dog buffet.  it is just 27 miles outside of 
town so we can hit that and then go play nickel slots.

Ivan-

I put the files in  O\portland\fundamentals\westgas\new folder(2).  Let me 
know if you have any questions.

doesn't matter.  it won't happen either way.

I put the files under o\dropbox\west.  They are the files titled CEMS, CEMS 
CA Gen, CEMS CA Heat Rate, & Cali Gen (CEMS).

if it is only nick and i who can't make it on the 24th you guys should go.  
it is going to be hard any  time to get a weekend that everyone can agree 
on.  don't let us hold you back.  

i can make the 24th of aug now

it went fine.  i am just glad that it is over.  i am now looking foward to 
the cruise.  hope all is well.

good news everyone!  looks like denver is gonna get steve young.  pencil us 
in for the superbowl.  i think that would make us a dynasty.

i know.  i am trying to make superbowl bets now.

both billy joe's were still under contract so the broncos had to get young.  
saints could have had scrubby brister if they had played their cards right.

nuggets will win the nba next year

i bet i can guess which ones

sailing

i am up for whatever.  let's just try to get something planned before xmas.

get your touches this week b/c next week i am gonna put it up at least 40 
times.

yeah.  we can rent a hobie boat and go sailing

i wanted to let you know i might be in for that weekend.  i am going to try 
to go home labor day instead.  i will know by mon.

Phillip-

Here is the presentation.  I also sent it to Ina.

my goal is to pull off a double play - unassisted.

we need to reschedule the cruise?  

my lessons were cancelled.  i cant take them until july now.  how was 
austin?  i saw your friends at the black swan.

i forgot to call them yesterday.  i will try tonight.  i leave sat for n.o. 
for the cruise.  i will be back the following sunday.

when?  eventually or are you giving your notice at work?

so you are serious about this

i don't know

who is that?

get me a ticket if you can.  chad is a mullet.

who is diamond dallas page?

your kids will end up on mulletsgalore

well if we have kids they definately are not watching wrestling.  if that is 
your choice of programing, i won't let them watch tv with you.

you will have an allowance that i will monitor closely.  

i will have you sign a prenuptual

we are going to new orleans sat and set sail sun.  for this summer i might go 
home for a weekend and to vegas for a bachelor party.  you?

any word on the houston opportunity?

how?  daddy always gets action.

too much beer retention on my six pack.  but my calves and thighs are so 
sculpted.  works of art.

lets drive in your new car

i will call them tonight.  they probably want to see you inagural for sure so 
hopefully the labor day weekend will be a good weekend for them to stay 
through.

i think i should be able to go that weekend.  just wanted to let you know 
since i hadn't rsvp'd.

i am in.  

where is this workbook and how do i link to it?

if you can get me a ticket i will go.  

nice.

you signed a prenup.  you will need a job.

i know who that is.  wasn't she a cheerleader?  how have you been?  i haven't 
heard from you in a while.  i will try to meet up with you guys tonight.  
call me at my house and let me know what time you guys are heading over.

yeah, i will.  she is great.  she thinks i am smart b/c i read the comics.  
plus she had a breast job.

you are right.  you are one of a kind.  i am lucky to have you.  you are 
buying some time past 50.  you just added another year or two (depends if i 
have all my hair or not).

it is not going to happen.  if i get hair on my back i will get it surgically 
removed.  anyway i don't have to worry about hair on my back.

yeah i need to get you a boob job.  i like DD.  work out your lower back b/c 
you are gonna have to carry my trophies around forever.

i like you the way you are, but i think you will look great with dd's

daddy is in.

tigers play at 6.  i think we are going to go to two rows to catch the game 
if you are up for it.

well you are gonna have to work out for 2 hours a day.  i want you to stay in 
top shape.  you can be my trophy wife.  are you really moving to austin soon?

my status is questionable now.

i can't wait for the cruise.  i will watch out for the hot women on the 
boat.  i might just stay in grand caymen and run a boat business if it is 
really nice there.  i want to go to denver over labor day weekend.  if you 
guys go up for the inagural it would be the following weekend.  memorial day 
would give me an extra day off. if you guys cannot stay through that weekend 
i will try to go over the 18th.  i will try to call tonight or tomorrow.

love matt

that is the saddest story i ever heard.  my security guard girlfriend work at 
night as a tow truck lady and she probably got pissed when she saw me hanging 
out with you guys and towed your car.  actually i don't think the game is 
going to play until 8:30.  here are your tasks for next week while i am out 
of town:  
 1. plan your party
 2. get music
 3. get food
 4. get booze 
 5. invite some people
 6.  let me know what i owe you

sounds good.  if the game comes on at 6 and we go to two rows i will let you 
know.  is your old ass boyfriend coming to the party?  

i will only say it is our party if it is fun.  if it sucks it is all you.    
i am not going out tonight.  game is on at 8:30 and i will just watch it at 
home.  i need my beauty sleep before the cruise.  my security guard 
girlfriend doesn't have an email address (she doesn't have a computer), but 
she does have an instant message pager.  you should try to buy some new cd's 
before your party.

i am not reading that in public

by the way, your book is way overdue

i thought you sniffed that stuff on the weekend for fun anyway

austin is a cool place to live even if you are not in school.  i wouldn't 
live in baton rouge and i loved going to school there.  you should do what 
you think is best for you.

the lust boat  will be exciting and new

i have these hanging on my porch

i will let you know this  week what the plan is.  you wont have to do 
anything except invite some people.

or something.

off, 4 days on.

this weekend if you are up for it.  coulon is coming in town.

i couldn't read.  i have never danced for 5 hours straight.  it was epic.  
how is it to visit there.  it seemed like a very nice place to check out.  
nothing else is really going on just trying to get an idea of what to do this 
weekend.  i got some good pics in jamaica.

artist unknown- rosa parks

Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.

Matt Lenhart

 

austin was great.  i love that place.  country grammar is a good song huh?  
how was your weekend?

sorry i didn't call back last night.  i didn't get back until 10.  i will try 
to call tonight.

it was good to see you too.  we should have partied some more.  it is tough 
to stay in denver for too long now b/c of work.  i think that website is 
classmates.com.  i am not sure b/c some girl here was on the website and that 
is where i saw dana's personal ad.  i was so funny b/c lisa wimbush said " i 
am 24 and engaged"  and dana said " i am 24 and single".  everyone at work 
was laughing.  i hope you are having fun in san fransico.  keep in touch.

matt

did you figure out what type of truck you won?

TIM HEIZENRADER

We've never used the CEMS data, so I don't know anything about its level of 
accuracy. As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got 
table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never 
reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- 
I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't 
use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, 
e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.

Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent 
periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously 
reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages 
from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate 
reports, then this might be the cause.

Are there certain plants where that have reliable generation numbers reported 
each time?  Should I just track these generators?

your friends from oregon live there?  i will check out that web site today.

i sent mckenna a gift certificate for her b-day.  it should be on your 
email.  let me know if you don't get it.

i am a shooter again.  i got a cell phone.  the number is 713-825-8410.  i am 
being annitiantion.

i have a cell phone now.  # is 713-825-8410

that what i said

mine is huge

this weekend we have to hit this new bar called the hub.  i heard it was full 
of hotties.  start there and end in your environment (merc room).  how was 
cali?

hot shit

how much weed did you smoke at that concert?

would you mind picking me up two tickets for prague?

i will still help you with your seatbelt.  my new ride is nice.  i cannot 
wait to pick it up.  it is so nice not to worry about the rain now.  i will 
be big pimpin in this ride.

i got a new ride.  i sold the jeep and got a tahoe.  daddy is money

i already made a rap cd at val's.  it has some great rap songs.  country 
grammar is the first song.  i will blare it with my new state of the art 
sound system.  i will pick it up today or tomorrow.

i don't wear fubu, i wear skidz.  it has jay-z, brand nubian, easy e, bone 
thugs, big punisher, limp bizkit,  

it is dark blue with tan interior.  i looks good.  i got an ureal deal on 
it.  i got it for cheaper than trade in blue book.  what are you going to 
get.

lets go to new orleans.  that sounds good to me.  i don't know how i got such 
a good deal but i am psyched up.  i can't wait.

are you getting a used car or a new car?  maximas are good.  i like the older 
models though.  

why don't you get a 95 maxima.  i think you can get those for around $10 or 
lower and just finance the rest.

those are cool.  maybe you should just keep yours until it is dead.  doesn't 
make sense to pay more since you just bought a new place.  how many bedrooms 
is it?  what is the new number?

set up a trip in oct.  maybe we can get a long weekend.  maybe lsu plays one 
day and we could check that out.  i will take a look.

call me when you get a chance.  they have the wrong ext. for you on voice 
activation thing.

who sings fucking right it's all right?

i am gonna drive my new ride.  hopefully i pick it up today.  it is so nice.  
i don't need a car this nice but what the hell.  how much is your mo. note 
gonna be on your house?

let s try to set up that weekend.

which telas?  the one on shepard or near montrose?

i will pick it up today or tomorrow.  it is a 1998.  i thought that the best 
i could do was a 96, but i got such a sweet deal on this one.  

i will pick it up today or tomorrow.  the guy needs to get his wife to sign 
some shit before i can get the loan money.

i will make it .  remind me thurs.

do i have to wear a tux or a suit

call me about it tonight

I know I've been slacking, so hopefully this can make up for lost
time.......

new years was fun.  i stayed in town and went to that club prague.  that 
place is crazy.   were you in new york through the end of the year?  i 
haven't heard of a natl champ party, but i think you should throw one.

are you burning up up there?  looks like it has been over 100.  i bought a 
new car.  i get it today.

i sold the jeep monday to some kid going to a&m next fall.  i bought a chevy 
tahoe.  it is great.  i pick it up today. it is midnight blue with a tan 
stripe at the bottom.  i got an incredible deal on it.  it is a 1998 and i 
was looking at 96's that were selling for more.  it is probably a little too 
nice for me, but what the hell.

mom said that you needed my phone number.  it is (713)807-1699.  

are you and angie gonna beat some ass that weekend?  i went to uropa fri.  
other than that it was fairly uneventful.  you?  i am gonna meet you guys out 
on thurs.  whose b-day is it?

sorry it has taken me so long to email you back.  are you going out this 
weekend?  i am going to some wedding with shirley on saturday.  i might go 
out fri.  let me know what is going on.

2nd pick is available if you can package a good offer together.

did you win your car?

i probably am going to cancel my sailing lessons b/c i don't have a car b/c 
that dude backed out on me.  i got to work this morning and he left a message 
for me last night at work saying his wife didn't want to sell it.  i am 
pissed.  i was ready to have it today.  i need to look for a car this weekend 
b/c this fell through.  i will be at telas tonight also.

i will be there.  it is at 8 right?

i cant open it

we bought tickets for $30.  it is a different place.  what did you do on new 
years?  i wasn't that excited for it this year.

i need to get tickets for my visit home.  how do you want me to do it.  it is 
$350 for a flight over the net.

that dude flaked on me over the car today.

is it still the 18th of august.  if it is i am in.

you might want to package a deal and move up to number 1 b/c if not you wont 
get the player you want.  daddy has #1.

does your head hurt

i have the number 1 pick in the draft.  i will trade it to you for your 1st 
and 2nd pick in the draft.  let me know what you  think.

i took my scooter to work.  i don't have a headache.  i didn't drink that 
much.  

annitiation

what does it look like?

i can only go fri and sat night not three days.

he is free.  they are getting him at the min.  he will be a good back up.  he 
just wants a chance to win a ring.

are those lsu recruits?  where can i see that stuff?

where is that dudes chevy place?

that guy screwed me on the car.  he backed out.  he left me a message at work 
to tell me he wouldn't sell it.  he had already signed the bill of sale.  now 
he wont return my message.  he is a pussy.

i bought another tahoe fri.  it is red with tan interior.  looks great.

i bought a car this weekend.  i got a chevy tahoe.  it is really nice.  it is 
an suv.  i will try to call this week.

i am going to go to vegas.  i am only going to go for fri and sat night. i 
emailed jacques back but i get messages saying he isn't receiving the email.  
make sure he knows i am going.  i am not going to alex's party.  i have too 
much to do here.  are you hooking up with the girl?  

do i need to rotate?  i wasn't planning on rotating right now.  i have been 
given new responsibilities on my desk and i don't want  to rotate and give 
those up.  please let me know what i need to do to stay in this group.

thanks

thanks for taking me.  i had fun.  i felt fine yesterday.  like a champ.  
good thing i didn't take shots.

maybe check with your travel agent and see if she can ge a cheaper flight.  
$350 is a lot.  i will schedule it this week.

love matt

tom white from enron?  why did he want me to give him a call?  i want to live 
in florida now.  maybe he knows of some good areas to check out.

is that the guy from enron?

i knew about trickett but  not the other guy.

he isn't ceo of enron.  he is a ceo of one of the subsidiaries.  still a big 
wig and multi-multi millionaire. 

you haven't received the toys r us stuff yet?

check within a 1/2 hour and it should be there.  i accidently gave the wrong 
email.  i put hfp instead of hfl. how was the trip?

he recognized me.  i told him i busted you two.  i have pictures.  he is 
sending me cash so i don't send them to his wife.  watch out for her.  she 
might be after you if i don't get that cash soon.  are we partying this 
weekend?  let me know.  how was your weekend?

i bought a ride on friday.  it is a pretty cool car - kind of retro.  i 
bought a gremlin, like the one in wayne's world.  some people laugh at it, 
but i think it is pretty cool.  it is also affordable.  tell angie she can't 
get into a fist fight.  i don't want to be embarassed if we all go out.  you 
guys can't throw your central gang signs or whatever you guys do before you 
represent.

it is purple.  i am going to paint the tires yellow and it will be the 
official car of the lsu alumni club.  

thanks for your analysis ron jaworski.

that is fine.  i should be there around 5:30.  

chicks dig gremlins.

Here are some of the California power sheets I have put together using your 
database.  I have filled in the historical data using the CEMS database, but 
that only runs through March-00.  Let me know what you think b/c there seems 
to be holes in the data.

around 8.  i was too dead to get up.  i will get it today.  his buddy adam 
got arrested that night for public intoxication.

are you gonna play or just tell us to hustle from the bench?

mick-

of the three colts the one you definately don't want with the 4th pick is 
marvin harrison.  i will trade you the 1st pick.  i have an offer for you if 
you want to look at it.

have you purchased your ticket for vegas yet?  i am going to get mine this 
week.  let me know if you are going.

notch.  tonight i am gonna blow up.  pass me the damn ball.  hopefully we 
don't play the team that dunks.  

what is going on in dallas?  is that where you are from?  i heard it is fun 
to go out up there.  i am staying in town this weekend b/c i have sailing

sick when i was on the cruise so i don' t think that i am going to be much of 
a sailor.  let me know if you guys have a happy hour.  

we should just not show up next week.  it is a 9 o'clock game against dudes 
who are going to embarrass us.  i would rather watch the real world or

on the couch and watch 20-30 consecutive episodes.  i know you do b/c the 
only other thing on is nascar.

ago are getting there now.  everyone is emailing me asking what the hell my 
emails mean.  i pay attention to your emails.

i am going to stay home tonight.  i need my beauty sleep. it is also nice 
being at home alone b/c chad is out of town.  i probably won't go out until 
sat.

that sounds great.  thanks a lot.

A preview of next season's MNF call:

DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear
nervous,
but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I
have
to tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the
outsider,
the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a
sporting
event.
And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of
Boomer's
old squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.
DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.
MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm
looking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I
put
my dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to
keep
up.
MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on
the
right foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on
the
Washington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65
million
in
free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking
for
results.
MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing
with
a
pop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to
coach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to
Gus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind
the
Stairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***
-chewing
Turner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that
little
room at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you
could
tell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up
and
end his ****ing misery.
MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the
kickoff.
FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.
MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a
breather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers
it's
holding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's
starting,
and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to
the
****ing Hakowis.
MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at
Monday
Night Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.
MILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle).
MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,
whom
I guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.
MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he
had
as
much chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.
This
guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.
He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer
Show.
MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such
as
Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.
MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the
Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's
appearance
tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one
of
Dr. Evil's monocles.
MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds
the
veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.
MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.
But
it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview
with Posh Spice.
FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

who is inga?

you know what my porn name is?  it is francis marion.  you can figure yours 
out by taking your middle name and adding it to the name of the street you 
grew up on.

it sucks to be somewhere flat for new years

you always think that i am lying.

you are going to pat benatar?  i wouldn't admit that at work, you might get 
demoted.  i am not going out tonight.  i need my beauty sleep.  i am planning 
on sat night so either call me at home or on my cell (713)8258410.

FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

I just wanted to rsvp for the ENA function on Aug. 2.

i just got my ticket for vegas.  i am arriving fri the 18th at 7:30pm.  be 
ready to party b/c money doesn't sleep big boy.

i got my ticket for fri the 18th.  i arrive in vegas at 7:30.  be ready to 
party b/c "money doesn't sleep".

how was new years?  i stayed in town and went to prague.

i would like the broncos newsletter

wild west sucks.  the only good thing was that there was $1 beers.  i hated 
country music and there were a ton of necks there.  how was that movie?  

looks like i will get to denver tues, aug 8th in the afternoon and leave 
thurs aug 10 in the afternoon.  i wont have much time but we will figure 
something out.  i have to work in the mornings out of the denver office and 
then we have some seminars to go to in the afternoon and some golf tourneys.  
i will figure something out and let you know.

what is the current head count on this trip?

it wasn't that bad.  i didn't get my ass kicked by some rednecks so it was 
ok.  you going out this week?  i might go out thurs.  if not we will hit 
downtown this weekend.  i will even drive my gremlin out.

i will have a little time.  one night you will have to hit the town.  drinks 
on the corp card.

it was scary but terrible?  how was volcanoes?  

two steppin' is for people who cant dance & i am a great dancer so therefore 
i do not two step.  

you guys like the worst places.  wild wild west, surf side sally's.  please 
tell me that the party won't end up at "shock 2000: the radioactive dance 
factory".  just let me know the plans & i will be there.

volcanoes was full of hotties?  i should have been there.  i might skip 
adrians and meet up with everyone later.  i hate adrians.  who knows.

tough loss.  pac 10 sure is tough for texas to beat.  

you hate erika also.

chad is not going b/c he is in a wedding.  tim said he is a game time 
decision, so i wouldn't count on it right now.

i will probably go to woody's thurs if i have a good week.

why aren't you going?

tell him to take us out on it.  how much does a boat like that cost?

i am definately going to the tenn game.  i am going to try to make at least 
three games.  it is hard to do these trips as a student with no steady 
income.  give me a call when you get a chance.  

i will try to get those names for you today.  if i don't do it today just 
remind me and i will get it done asap.

you going to vegas.  i just got my ticket.

i would sell my house and move on the boat.  i would probably buy a pet 
alligator to keep on deck to protect my property.  golf this weekend if i 
don't have sailing lessons.  they bagged me on the lessons last weekend.

send me that picture again.  i accidently deleted it.

jeff-

could you get me access to a foward curve for pv, np, & sp? thanks for your 
help.

matt

you are an 832.  i would try to get that changed as quickly as possible.  you 
don't want to be an 832.   i did get your message.  you love that song don't 
you?

yeah but i  am not going to tell people you are an 832.  if you meet a guy 
don't give him that number right away until you thinks he likes you b/c that 
could be a deal breaker.

i have a late basketball game tomorrow night that i forgot about.  

probably around 10.  if not tomorrow definately thurs.

who cares about the last 4 digits?  it is the area code that matters.

just in case you didn't see it- 4 broncos made the 1st team all decade team.  
elway is the starter and your boy in sf didn't even make 2nd team tim.  

you say brister could make the all decade team throwing to rice and young 
couldn't?  that is not saying much for your boy.  he is better than brister, 
just not elway.

do i need to stop using my previous i.d. and password and use this instead?

i just found out that i get in tues afternoon and leave thurs afternoon.  we 
will try to get together at least once.

i decided not to go b/c nobody really had any plans.  i didn't want to drive 
either.  chad is moving tomorrow.  are you guys partying this weekend?

i am going there for basically two days the second week of aug.  i won't have 
much time.  hopefully i will meet them for lunch or something but it is 
definately going to be a short visit.  at least i will be back two weeks 
later.  did grandma get her truck?    hopefully you and billy can make it 
over labor day weekend.  i just bought a new car.  it is actually a used 
chevy tahoe.  i love it.  it is so much nicer than the jeep.  it is too nice 
for me but as long as i am meeting my goals in savings each month i think i 
can afford it.  hope all is well.  tell billy hello.

matt

i am probably going to go to woody's

if anyone is up for getting some drinks at woody's tonight i am in.  i am 
going to test my new theory out tonight: hot school teachers don't have 
anything to do in the summer so they go out to try to meet guys with careers 
that can support them.  it is actually just a hypothesis at this point, but 
sierra on wednes. has added support.  let me know if you are in. and remember 
it is the in the name of science.

out

you are one of the lead researchers on the project.  we need you.

are we golfing sun afternoon?

where are you going after adrians.

we are going to cadillac and then the swan.

who is this?

how was woody's when i left?  who all is going out with you on sat?

you forgot to add stanford to your list.  i think they worked you over too.

me, chad, this dude steve and maybe a straggler or two.

are there any hotties coming?

how is everything in south florida?  things are busy here.  i am not storming 
the campuses for sorority chicks, but that isn't a bad idea.  email me your 
phone number again & i will try to write it down this time.

that is funny

I have a question on the generation number we are pulling from your 
database.  The hydro numbers are coming in positive and negative.  Could you 
please explain the difference there when you get a chance.  Thanks for your 
help.

Matt Lenhart

   "The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college 
football conferences-"

CKL

SEC TRADITIONS
                                           A weekly column by Chris Warner

                                           Perspectives on SEC Football and 
Thoughts on
                                           the Impending Football Season

                                           I would like to kickoff this 
column with a few choice quotes from the
                                           annals of a most colorful, and 
telling, SEC gridiron history:

                                           "Southern football fans are 
knowledgeable, fair and loud. They are proud
                                           of their football heritage, their 
schools, and their teams. And they share a
                                           deep pride that goes with being 
from the south" --George Mooney, the
                                           irreplaceable "Voice of the 
Volunteers" in the 1950s

                                           "The true football fan pays no 
attention to time or mileage when there is a
                                           big game to see." --John Heisman, 
head coach, Auburn University

                                           "In Baton Rouge, the focal point 
of everything is Tiger football." --Jim
                                           Corbett

                                           "In Baton Rouge, it's not a law to 
love LSU, but the city fathers could
                                           probably get one passed if they 
needed to." --Charles McClendon, head
                                           coach, LSU

                                           "After so many years at a school, 
you become a member of the football
                                           family." --Bob Fulton

                                           "I don't care where a man comes 
from or how he spells his name. All I
                                           ask is that he be loyal to 
Georgia, proud of that jersey, and try like the
                                           devil to win." --Wally Butts, head 
coach, Georgia

                                           "Deep inside, we're still the boys 
of autumn, that magic time of the year
                                           that once swept us on to America's 
fields." --Archie Manning

                                           "Tradition is a rich asset for any 
team. Tradition and success are traveling
                                           companions." --Wallace Wade, head 
coach, University of Alabama

                                           The above quotes were excerpted 
from Criswell Freeman's "The
                                           Wisdom of Southern Football" 
(1995).

                                           As football season creeps ever 
closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult
                                           to contain the unbridled 
excitement and anticipation that bubbles like
                                           summertime sweat within their 
pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is
                                           that special time of year that not 
only means the beginning of another
                                           healthy slate of competitive 
gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays
                                           and high drama--it's also the 
definitive rallying point for the onslaught of
                                           all the expected pomp, pageantry, 
and circumstance that goes
                                           hand-in-hand with the college 
game. In no conference in the country is
                                           this statement more true than the 
tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.
                                           The ongoing rivalries, the 
colorful histories and traditions, the premier
                                           tailgating, the coquettish 
southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion
                                           of lasting friendships, and the 
competitive fire and spirit that accompany
                                           the game, all make the entire SEC 
football experience a very real, and
                                           visceral one--even to the most 
casual observer. 

                                           The Southeastern Conference is 
unequivocally the paragon of the college
                                           football conferences, and the 2000 
season figures not to disappoint the
                                           thousands of rabid fans that flock 
to the stadiums each week throughout
                                           the southeast; as well as the 
millions more who tune in from home on the
                                           tube to follow their respective 
teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has
                                           never been bigger, or better. The 
southern cultural phenomenon only
                                           continues to grow with each 
passing season. The number of fans, and the
                                           competition that they long for 
each and every weekend of the football
                                           season, has never been bigger or 
better. In 1999, the SEC again set
                                           attendance records for its games, 
and with the many recent expansions to
                                           existing stadiums in the 
conference, those records should again fall at the
                                           end of this season. 

                                           Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be 
Excited About the 2000 Football
                                           Season

                                           1. Lou Tepper is no longer in 
Tiger Town.

                                           Heralded by professional defensive 
coaches as a "guru" and a "defensive
                                           genius" prior to his arrival at 
LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the
                                           LSU defense to its worst two-year 
performance in the history of the
                                           school (1893). If you are 
interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at
                                           LSU for your scrapbook, copies of 
his book "Complete Linebacking"
                                           can still be obtained (at a 
discounted price no less) at most local book
                                           outlets. In Tepper's absence, 
maybe the Tigers will return to the days of
                                           coach Charlie Mac and the standout 
defensive units that were his
                                           trademark while at the Ole War 
Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught
                                           up with him last week at his home 
and he sounded as spry as a spring
                                           chicken. He told me that he is 
doing great and that he enjoys cycling in
                                           the mornings to stay in shape. 
Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU
                                           players have fun this year, 
because, he said, "...having fun is what it's all
                                           about. If you can't have any fun, 
you're in big trouble."

                                           2. Contrary to popular belief, the 
Tigers are deep at quarterback.

                                           Preseason prognosticators have 
cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a
                                           core reason why the Tigers will 
have trouble at the quarterback position.
                                           They all opined early that both 
Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the
                                           offense and that the injury to 
Davey was a major setback to the Tiger
                                           offense. However, reports from 
summer camp indicate that Rohan is now
                                           within 95-100 percent of his 
normal range of motion on his knee, and in
                                           light of this it would appear that 
the Tigers are again three-deep at the
                                           quarterback position. The 
resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to
                                           the team. Known for his leadership 
ability both on and off the field,
                                           Rohan possesses the true grit that 
wins ball games. I caught up with
                                           former LSU All-American and coach 
Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland
                                           Road home a few weeks ago, and he 
told me that he thought that
                                           Rohan's performance against 
Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by
                                           an LSU quarterback. True frosh 
Marcus Randall impressed in the LA
                                           High School All-Star game last 
week, but he is a likely redshirt with the
                                           logjam of experienced competition 
ahead of him.

                                           3. Nick Saban.

                                           Derided unfairly early by most SEC 
media outlets as being "incompatible"
                                           with Louisianians' unique culture 
and high football expectations, Saban is
                                           easily the best thing to happen to 
LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A
                                           consummate professional, Saban 
exudes confidence and paints a clear
                                           vision for the future of the 
program. His presence in Red Stick has made
                                           an immediate impact on the 
program, evidenced by the recent glowing
                                           comments at media days by seniors 
Louis William and Fred Booker.
                                           Saban was also unfairly chastised 
heavily by the media for his inability to
                                           bring any assistants with him to 
LSU from his previous staff at Michigan
                                           State. However, Coach Saban 
recently aptly stated at the SEC media
                                           days that only a couple of his 
previous staff members had ever been
                                           "south of the Mason-Dixon line." 
That notwithstanding, you cannot argue
                                           with the fact that Saban has 
compiled a great staff of southern coaches.
                                           Tiger fans should find further 
solace in the fact that coach Saban has
                                           never had a losing record as a 
football coach.

                                           4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at 
Linebacker.

                                           All good defenses have a common 
trait--great linebacking play, and you'll
                                           be hard-pressed to find two better 
young horses than these two. Outside
                                           linebacker and pass rushing 
specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super
                                           sophomore to keep your eyes on. 
These guys all have good wheels, and
                                           will put the leather on you when 
they get the chance. James' number 11
                                           Faulk's recent acquisition of 
Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt
                                           many fans and commentators to make 
countless puns and jokes related
                                           to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.

                                           5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly

                                           The other day I was scouring 
through the many rolls of microfilm in the
                                           basement of Middleton Library at 
LSU, and I stumbled upon this most
                                           interesting fact: 

                                           In August, 1958, LSU was picked to 
finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.
                                           Auburn, which had won the national 
championship the year prior with
                                           Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat 
as conference champs, followed by
                                           Ole Miss and Mississippi State. 

                                           Of course, in spite of the dismal 
preseason ranking by the SEC
                                           sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers 
went on to record their only unblemished
                                           season and national college 
football championship to date. This story
                                           should only serve to encourage 
fans that are despondent over the
                                           outcome of the past two seasons in 
Tigertown. Anything can happen in
                                           the SEC, and remember, the old 
adage says that "history repeats itself."

                                           Keep the faith Tigerfans!

                                           Until next time...

sure

you don't think the saints will make the playoffs now?  just this past 
weekend you were telling me that your in depth analysis led you to conclude a 
playoff berth for the saints.  you don't want to back up those statements 
after the saints preseason opener?  it sounds like every saint fan in august: 
predicting the playoffs in august and wearing a paperbag on your head by week 
5.  

you spelled sholes wrong.

i am going to take stephen davis.  

boondoggle.  golf & booze.  i need to meet with some customers.

plove only knows the skanks over at the pink pussycat, so that is an option.  
the girls are not that bad if we bring some clearisil for the blemishes and a 
couple of cases of beer.

i am going to take rodell meally.  he can recover from that acl quickly.

your wife isn't on this list.  you don't need to lie about going there.

sorry shooter

i wont tell.  you could be sakora pine.  that is a pretty good porn name.  

that is the best news i heard all day.  how was new orleans.

i am a big shooter.

what is your brother in law's name?

I have been out of town the last couple of days.  If you want to meet today 
that would be fine.  

you don't like my secretary?  what is going on?  how was your party?  i was 
in denver.

i would go but i need to save money b/c i am going to vegas next weekend.  i 
was there for work.  it was fun.  we just drank  and went golfing.  let me 
know what is going on tonight.

i guess you owe me $50 since you haven't returned with your score.  must have 
been a pretty high score.  you can pay me whenever or get my money to 
shirley.

that girl jennifer the secretary works up here now.  should i put in a good 
word for you?

what did you do on new years?  sorry i didn't come.  i didn't feel good and i 
didn't feel like driving 10 hours for a short weekend.  i was glad sunday i 
wasn't on the road b/c i felt like shit.  did you see lsu?

the web page will have everything

i think you must have set a record or something on it.  if you would have 
passed easily i am sure i would have heard from you earlier.  i think you 
scored around a 200 or something.  don't be a welch.  just admit you lost and 
pay your debt.

check the web again

are you looking for a job here or something?

use a printer and print it off

is that how one of your dirty stories started in that porn mag you have?

Here is the forecast.  Our meeting using these numbers won't be until 
tomorrow so they will most likely change shortly.

sorry to send this dumb email but i am supersticious.

Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
review.

email and you could sign me up.  just let me know what i need to do.

matt lenhart

griese for duece

Hey there, just an update on where we stand.?  We are up to 33 people that 
have responded that they are in with a few more that  I definitely expect in 
by the time games start.? Only 8 have signed in but  there is still time to 
get on the site.? I wouldn't wait till the last  second incase there are 
problems.? Let me know if you can't figure anything  out and I will try to 
help.
?
Just a few side notes...1)? Applebaum, we are  going to have to work on that 
name you signed in with...2) Susan, I will send  you a seperate email in the 
next couple of days with some help on getting on  line.
?
Anyway, don't forget to get more players.? BUT  DON'T FORGET TO HAVE THEM 
REFERENCE YOU!!!? I am receiving emails from  people I can't reference and it 
just takes a little work to figure out who they  are.? We have got all of 
them cleared up except for one that I am still  working on.? It just makes it 
alot easier if they mention you from the  begining.
?
Well, that is it for now.? Will get back to  you towards the middle of next 
week with some more updates.
?
Brook

Wow, what a response we have had so far...23  players are in (old news, more 
than that now).? WE NEED MORE  HOWEVER!!!!? Don't forget to spread the word 
if anyone you know would be  interested.? I surely expect atleast 10 more to 
join but would love alot  more.? Anyway, now to the important stuff...getting 
on the  site.
?
Unlike in years past, I feel that people are more  internet literate and can 
get signed up in a league without step by step  instructions.? So I am going 
to give you the basics and you can figure it  out from there.? I advise you 
do it sooner than later incase you have any  problems.
?
The site is www.commissioner.com.? On the home  page, you will see the?a 
place to sign into commissioner.? You must  have an account with 
commission.com to join the league.? It is the same  site we used last year 
and your name and password should still be active.?  If you don't remember 
it, you can create a new one or there is probably  somewhere that you can get 
them to email you your?username and  password.? Anyway, once you set up an 
account scroll down and select Office  Pool Manager. Our league name is 
Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name  of Loser (they might ask for that 
also, **notice no 's').? The password is  3333.
?
You should be taken to a page to pick who you  are.? Your name should not be 
in the list.? Select "new player" and  enter your name.? This should take you 
to the site.
?
Once you are in....BOOKMARK IT.? It will make  it alot easier to get to it in 
the future.? Take a look at the site.?  The three main links you will be 
using are...1)Make Picks...2)My  Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think 
Tuesday) commissioner.com will  enter the lines on the Make Picks page.? 
These lines will stay constant  untill they close the entries for the week (1 
hour before first kick?off,  includes Thursday games).? You can make your 
picks and change your picks on  this page.? To view your picks you can go to 
My Picks.? On Monday you  can check the Standings.? You can view it by a 
certain week or the yearly  totals.? Just click on the top on what column you 
will want to sort  by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you 
want to check  them out...it is a great site.
?
As for the rules...the money will all be determined  as I get an exact number 
of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!!!! There will  be weekly winners 
and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each  week will be each 
game that week, including Monday nights game.? In  addition to Monday's game, 
you will pick the Monday night total points  scored.? This tie breaker will 
determine weekly winners in case of any  ties.? The person closest to the 
total will win the tie breaker (absolute  value).? If the absolute value is 
equal, the under will beat the  over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player 
A picks 35...B picks  20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.? 
Don't worry, it  is real easy.? 
?
As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?  Anyone that is tied at the 
top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our  playoffs.? I will send out the 
lines (the site won't have them) to the  players involved.? You will pick all 
four games and the person who gets the  most correct will win.? If multiple 
people tie then we will weed out and go  on to the next weeks.? If it makes 
it all the way to the superbowl, then we  will pick the game and an 
over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker.
?
Don't worry if you don't make your picks one  week.? You won't take a zero?( 
I am a softie).? Too many people  have those weeks that they can't get around 
to making there picks.? If I  gave zeros, that would kill your chances for 
the yearly total.? Anyone that  doesn't get their picks in will take all the 
AWAY teams.? I will enter  those picks after the deadline to enter picks.? 
All these games will count  to the yearly total but can not win the weekly 
prize.? 
?
That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?  You can send me a check ($50) 
to the following.? 
?
Michael Brookner
3001 Hillcroft #508
Houston, TX 77057
?
?
PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW  PLAYERS.??I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS 
IN.? IF YOU KNOW  SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT 
BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO  TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST.
?
?
THANKS....Brook

did you go on your vacation yet?  i hope you are not on it now b/c there is a 
huge hurricane heading into the gulf.  you could end up like gilligan.

are you guys going on a date or something

i will tell him i am your pimp

woman dont ya know i'll kill ya

i will take that bet.

i don't have hbo

you should thow a rager.  congrats

i hope i have a girlfriend after i get married.  that would be nice.

did i say something wrong?

which age comment?  the one when i said that you were too old to be my 
girlfriend after i get married?

yeah baby i am in town this weekend.  i called the h.r. woman and she hasn't 
called back.  i am gonna email her your resume.  it looked good.

hey, cheer up pumpkin.  you aren't thirty yet so don't worry about it.

um, why do your knees hurt?  have you been bad?

i am always good.  i know the secret.  but i haven't put my good secret to 
use lately.

she was on howard stern and some 18 year old won a prom date with heard and 
lost his v-card.  she kind of dated him for a bit.  nice girl.  

you make them.  i just don't think they will win the next two nat'l champ.

give me edgerrin

i was about to accept that.

well compared to chad i get more action than a porn star.  the secret is a 
secret.  i can't let it out.  you saw that seinfeld.

Harry-

I just offered up a trade to you.  Take a look when you get a chance and let 
me know what you think.

where are you with your family?  i went to vegas and lost money.  watch out 
for that  hurricane.  if it strenthens think of me b/c i will be happy b/c 
that will mean that gas prices increase.  we will go out and party when you 
get back.

yeah.  uh thanks for calling  at 1:30.   you sounded mollered.  where did you 
go?  who did you go out with?

make some changes and i will send it to her today.  she didn't get back to me 
but i will call her again today.  i might go tonight.  what time is it 
tonight.

just send it to me from home tonight and i will get it to the lady tomorrow.  
let me know if you go tonight and i might tag along.

are you going to try to be an investment banker on wall street?  that would 
be cool.  i could visit & try to meet some models that i might want to marry.

i mean big 12.  i don't think they will win the next two nat'l 
championships.  texas definately won't.

i wish i lived the life of a rock star.  that would be good.  actually life 
is good.  work is going well.  do you feel better?  hopefully we can get out 
to phoenix over thanksgiving again so you can beat the tar out of me at 
golf.  here is my analogy of you & me at golf:  you are tiger woods on sunday 
and i am greg norman at the masters on sunday.  i will try to call this 
weekend.

love matt

you are in nyc?  no your not.  don't set me up with the dirty talker, i am 
afraid she would embarass me.

i hope it becomes a hurricane too.  huricanne = $$$$ for me.  call me when 
you get back from your 3 week vacation.  it must be really hard over there at 
deloit.  

are you really in nyc?  

you lucked out.  there isn't a hurricane.

i probably will party tomorrow b/c it is going to be the best day of work 
ever.  i actually kind of interviewed at csfb in nyc.  that would be huge if 
you got a job with them.  i know two guys that work there.   if you are in 
banking you better get used to 80-100 hours a week.  talk to you later 
holmes.

we cant go get drinks if you are in a body cast.  that would look to crazy.  
i would be trying to pour a margarita down the opening for your mouth.  i am 
glad the weather is good.  it really doesn't matter too much about the 
hurricane.  call me when you get back.

lucky fuck

i went to woody's last night.  there was such a hottie coming in when i was 
leaving and i would have stayed but today was such a big day at work i 
couldn' t be exhausted and hung over.  she could have been my wife.  i love 
woody's when it is warm.  ken's email is kenneth.shullklapper@enron.com

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would
have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.
(Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough
gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.
(Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want
to be a pig) (How'd they figure this out, and why?)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.
(Still can't get over that pig thing)
(Don't try this at home...maybe at work?)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for
pleasure.  (Is that why Flipper was always smiling?)
(And pigs get 30-minute orgasms? Doesn't seem fair)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hmmmmmmmmm........)

Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than
left-handed people do.
(If you're ambidextrous do you split the difference?)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times
its own weight and always falls over on its right side when
intoxicated.
(From drinking little bottles of...?)
(Did taxpayers pay for this research??)

Polar bears are left handed.
(Who knew....? Who cares? How'd they find out, did they
ask them?)

The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.
(What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?)

The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a
human jumping the length of a football field.
(30 minutes...can you imagine?? And why pigs?)

A cockroach will live nine days without it's head, before
it starves to death.
(Creepy)

The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is
attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping
the male's head off.
(Honey, I'm home. What the....)
(Well, at least pigs get a break there...)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day.
(In my next life I still want to be a pig ... quality over
quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet.
(Oh, Geez)  (That's almost as bad as catfish)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain.
(I know some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains.
(I know some people like that too.)

After reading all these, all I can say is.............
Lucky Pigs...

Toni-

Here is the resume I left you a message about.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.

Thank you, 

Matt Lenhart

i told her that you were interested in her

you must be on this "best conference" kick b/c your team lost.  sec had a 
down year by their standards, but that isn't the point.  lsu beat a good 
georgia tech team to win the peach bowl.  texas lost to a pac-10 team.  i 
don't need to pump up the lsu's conference b/c we won our bowl game.  i will 
pay you, but it is pretty sad that you are cheering for an arch rival that 
smoked you guys in dallas.

just open an account at www.wsex.com

Hey guys and gals, just a reminder that we  are?less than a week away from 
kickoff and I see that you have not joined  in the office pool.? By now you 
should have received the directions on how  to join the pool.? There is still 
plenty of time but I still advise not to  wait to long just incase you have 
any problems.
?
We are at over 40 players as long as each of you  join up.? Let me know if 
you have changed your mind so I can take you off  my list (at least for this 
year).
?
Hope all is going well and I'll look for you on the  page.

i see your brother in law doing some trades on line with us

8-3.  tenn.  sucks.  we roll them.  

i leave for denver on thurs.  

lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most 
important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have 
such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has 
proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were 
this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule 
and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at 
this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned 
out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou.  
good luck.

i heard you were anyway

we can get drinks wed if you would like. let me know when a good time is.

i get back monday night.  we can get a drink next week.  that actually works 
out better for me anyway.  what are you doing this weekend.

i haven't found out about my test yet.  i am pretty sure i failed.  i didn't 
study enough.  

i called her and she still isn't there.  i wonder if she still has a job 
here.

she still works here.  she is probably on vacation or something.  i am sure 
she will get right back to daddy when she gets in town.  she sounds hot.

i am going to denver.  i will be ready for it next week.  

i am going to denver tomorrow.  i am excited to get home for a couple of 
days.  how did you know i went to the black swan?  i saw some girl who was at 
that wedding we went to and she lives in your apt. complex.

i had manning but i traded him away b/c i had no backs.  now i have vodka 
collins starting for me.

did you talk to max?  what night should we go out?  if we only go out 1 night 
i vote sat.  if we go out both that is cool too.  what time is cu/csu?

i am going to go out.  give me a call at home or on my cell.

csu is the underdog and i would bet that they get punished.  tell max to stay 
out of the ghetto.  property there doesn't appreciate.

thanks for the email.  i am hopefully taking off tomorrow night, but i am not 
sure b/c  i am flying united.  it will be good to be home for a few days.  
vegas was fun.  i went for a bachelor party.  some of my friends are starting 
to fall.  i hope billie's mom is okay.  i will talk to you soon.  

love matt

what the fuck are the highlands

isn't that where the vatos live

i have that work trip on oct. 21st.  is there another weekend that you could 
come to n.o.?

disregard my last email.  we might not be going on that weekend.

i called united and it sounds like my flight will fly.  see you tonight.

i can go that weekend.

nothing more sexy than a girl that can dance

what is going on?  i don't think we need your tickets.  if you want me to try 
to sell them there i will.  how was labor day weekend for you?  what did you 
do?

can you foward me the rules for that loser league?

can you send down your rockies forecast again?  i need to look at your 
numbers for the winter again.

thanks

matt

that game was great.  i was so impressed with griese & gary & the whole 
office.  the defense is a major concern.  i am torn between being impressed 
with what they did on the road in a hostile environment or being freaked out 
b/c of that defense.  st. louis had a good defense last year.  i hope their 
defense is still good b/c that would say a lot about our offense.

how was your labor day.

37176

the defense couldn't even stop them.  they have no place to go but up.  i am 
concerned about the d.  you need that to win in the playoffs.

olandis gary tore his acl.  he is out for the season.

nope.  we can hit the town this weekend.  i like that place the hub.  they 
play good music.

how did that happen.  i thought there was all mo's and no ho's.

who is that

Eric told me to shoot you an email to bid on a free agent.  I want to bid $5 
on Mike Anderson of the Broncos.  Let me know what else I need to do.  

Thanks,
Matt

during the 3rd quarter

do i need to just send you a check for $20 or should i just send the $50?  is 
there just a tally at the end of the year with the payouts then?

congratulations!  is that in austin or houston?

denver was nice.  i just played golf and took it easy.  when is your test?  
are you watching the lsu game this weekend?  i think that we are going have a 
bbq somewhere for the game.  i will let you know.

daddy won the first week.

what are you going to be doing?

cram

we will finish top ten next year in the polls

you guys have happy hour every night.  what time are you going thurs?

so are you now an analyst - investment banker?  is your pay better?  are you 
going to work 90 hours a week?

,  

you going?  if it is next weekend sign me up.

only problem is that there is an lsu game sat.

what does he trade

remember this.  we might need to go check it out after  the game.
I hear this is pretty easy action. I guy I play softball with on Mondays
goes to these things. He said you just get hammered and go back to the hotel
and hit it.

Here is the morning ops.  Congrats on the new baby.

if shirley hasn't left town yet i think i can get him a ticket.  let him come 
even if nobody back out anyway.  it doesn't matter squeezing 1 more person 
into the room.

i can probably meet up with you guys around 7:30ish.  will you guys still be 
there at that time?  call me on my cell at (713)853-7176 if you guys go 
somewhere else.

i will drive if it doesn't rain.  my windshield wipers don't work.

hoskins car is too small

the girl i was going to talk to in this group is out today.  i will talk to 
her.  she is always asking me if i know any analyst who need work.  i am 
gonna be a rock star sat night.

this isn't porn is it

i will try to meet you there

did you open an account on world sports exchange?  if you open one use me as 
the referral and i will split the $50 with you and we can make a bet.  i 
might go meet jill and them for drinks around 730 if you want to go.

call the cell

queen

thanks for sending me another chain letter.  i am very superstitious.

how was last night?  sorry i didn't make it.  i was planning on going but i 
got home late.  i did check out woody's.  it was ok.  when do you leave for 
okla?

where did you guys go after cadillac?

have you signed up with world sports exchange?  refer me.  my user name is 
mlenhart.  we can split the $50 that they will put into my account and place 
a parlay bet.  

sammy marcos and wayne gonz want to come

you have too much time on your hands.

when you do it give me a call on my cell and i will call in a bet.

i think we might go to someones place and then go out afterwards

i know someone else who wants to play coed softball if there are space 
available for guys.

try to find out where club monkey is going sat and we will front run them to 
the bar.

here it is

i have a good idea for that business.  there are all these gov't forclosure 
properties that we should buy up cheap.  we can discuss it more next time we 
get drunk.

I hear this is pretty easy action. I guy I play softball with on Mondays
goes to these things. He said you just get hammered and go back to the hotel

Ross Berthelot <rossberthelot@home.com> on 09/08/2000 05:30:27 PM
Please respond to rossberthelot@home.com
At their annual meeting before the beginning of the football season,
the top southern football programs decided to have Golden phones
installed in each of their respective offices. One day a recruit named
Marcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw his
Golden phone sitting there. "Wow," Marcus exclaimed, "What's that?"
 Jackie responded, "Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a direct
line to Heaven. "Wow, that's pretty neat," Marcus responded. "Do
you think I could make a call on that phone?"  "Well yes, but it's
going to cost you about $100. You can make the check out to the
Mississippi State University Football Foundation," replied Jackie.
"That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much.
Thanks anyway," Marcus replied as he left the office.

A few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of Texas
A&M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office where
again he saw a Golden phone.  "What exactly is that phone for?"
asked Marcus.  Coach Slocum replied, "That's my direct line to
Heaven."   "Do you think I could make a call from that phone?"
asked Marcus.  "Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $200,
and you can make the check out to the Texas A&M University
Foundation." replied Slocum.   "Oh never mind, I don't have that
kind of money. Thanks though."  Marcus shook his head and left
Coach Slocum's office.

The next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana State
University campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop.
Upon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phone
on Coach Saban's desk.  Marcus asked if that was a direct line to
Heaven.  When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again asked
if he could make a call using the phone.  "Well sure you can, but it
will cost you 35 cents," replied Saban.  Upon hearing this, Marcus'
eyes got real big and he said, "Really?  Then why did Coach
Sherrill and Coach Slocum tell me it would cost so much more?"
Coach Saban looked up from behind his desk and smiled, saying,
"Because, son, here at LSU, it's a local call."

L S U --- GO TIGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i heard langley is out for the year.  who will fill that gap?

no subject = ebonics?  that makes no sense.

i heard it is 8.5.  i will try to talk to someone today.

it was ok.  i went to austin fri night and watched the ut game on sat.  how 
was that wedding?  was it worth going up to neckville, oklahoma? are you 
hitting the town this week?  let me know if you want to go get a drink.

do you have your resume to email me again.  i can't remember where i saved 
it.

i can get you on that team if you can get that girl to play.  i guess they 
need girls on the team

i am worried about them dropping like flies.  i thought last year we were 
injury prone but this year is worse.  i am still skeptical about the 
defense.  next week will tell a lot.

i want to do it.  it will be fun to be your boss.

not you please.  she can wear one.  i think it is on tues.

rules of attraction
   less than zero
   glamorama

read in that order. 

i heard from the girl you beat up.  she told me you said "what are you 
looking at bitch?"  and then you told her "this is central fool, you'd betta 
recognize!".  sounded like you really took it to her.  i am going to the tenn 
game.  i am probably going to woodrows for the next game.

they told me to send in the resume to h.r.

i tried but they have to go through it anyway.  i told them to inquire about 
your resume.

it was just those three.  you have to read them in that order.

we should go to n.o. over the first weekend in december and catch the broncos 
at the saints

we can do that or go when we planned and hit the lsu game

mike-

here are some of the ops sheets.  let me know if you need some of the 
others.  the cali power sheet is down so i cannot send it.

what did the sluts look like

i lost your number in austin.  i tried to give you a call last night and 
clear up our argument  from saturday.  that got way out of hand and i 
apologize for that.  there is no reason for me to be such a hot head about 
that.  give me a call when you get a chance and we can clear up that mess.  
your parents got your stuff yesterday.  let me know what you want to do with 
that tv.  talk to you later.

matt

see about scheduling that weekend then.  it is the weekend of dec. 3rd.

i won 3 of 4 sunday afternoon, lost 50 sunday night and lost 80 last night.  
struggled at the end.  going out thurs?

is that nov. 30?  i probably cannot get there until fri.  i can get tickets

that is really classy 

i am making money taking the other side of the boys.  they suck this year.  
worst part is that they don't have 1st round picks next year.  call chris 
gaskill.  he should be able to send you a file of those gas dailies.  later.

i cannot go.

Cooper-

Here is the list of the hour ahead scheduled flows:

Generation: Load:  Imp/Exp:
Humb  Humb  COI_BG
NP15  NP15  El Dorado
SF  SF  Mead
SP15  SP15  PV
ZP26  ZP26  Path 15

If we can get the data starting 9/1/2000 that would be great.  Thanks again 
for your help.  I hope this isn't too much trouble.

Matt

i sent your stuff into to someone else in h.r.  i haven't heard anything 
yet.  you might hear something before i do.  if i hear anything i will let 
you know.  woody's tomorrow?

to hit woodrows  to catch the lsu game.  what are you doing?  did you go to 
dave matthews?

do you want to go up to dallas the weekend of oct 7th and catch the ou-tex 
game.  i heard it is wild up there around that time.  all ou and tx chicks.  
we can stay at emmitts or something.

sorry about last night.  dinner took a while at el tiempo.  i was dead after 
eating.

are you going out tonight?  we are going to woodrow's for the game tomorrow.

tonight.  game is at 6.30.;

how about the broncos?  they looked good.  defense is still suspect.

you missed a hell of a saturday night.  all these hot chi-o's were a woodrows 
watching the lsu game.  they were all in from out of town and we met up with 
them later to go out.  there were about 12 of them and i would say 7 were 
hotties.

what about football

yeah.  didn't you get it already?

what is up with cu?  they suck.  i'm not going to run my mouth about the 
broncos b/c i don't want to jinx them.  defense will get better as they play 
more.

call me back.  i accidently hit a button on the phone to disconnect.

i am in.  do you need anyone else to play b/c chad wants to play if we have 
room.  we could always use another pass rusher.

are the softball games tues nights?  when do they start? where are they?  i 
need to tell that chick.

you can play football.  we play tomorrow night at 7pm.

yeah.  both of you can go.  just show up.

looks like we are going to have to find a couple of loser fijis who can't 
find dates for the tennessee game and lift their tickets.  i am so fired up 
for that game.  tim just told me it is the 6:30 game on espn.

Cooper-

The sheet that you sent me earlier doesn't refresh anymore.  It is  saying 
that a rollback transaction is missing.  Let me know if I need to do anything 
to fix it.  Thanks for your help.

Matt

what happened to griese?

here is the info.  let that chick know.
Matt,

Softball starts in 2 weeks on Oct. 3rd. I imagine they'll send out an email
with more info later in the week or possibly beginning of next week. It is a
co-ed non-competitive league, but there are some pretty good players out
there.

later,
Mitch

are the softball games tues nights?  when do they start? where are they?  i
need to tell that chick.

just let me know

no.  tell her it is off of buffalo spwy.  

so you are going to just stay in and tame the shrue all night 

We have a game tonight at 7:00.  Please try to make it to the field by 6:30.

-Eric

sounds like you would be calculating a book each day.  it might be a good 
entry into trading, but i would check with them on how they have their 
program set up to get people into trading positions.  let me check with h.r. 
today.  they move slow.  i would ask some questions on that posting to find 
out where it would put you eventually.  trading is the way to go.  more money 
in trading and your opportunities would open up throughout the industry.

i think she is in.  i would stay away from scheduling.  you definately don't 
want to do that.  we might go out tonight to sierra.  i will let you know.

Pat-

I am bidding $5 for nedney (kicker-denver)

where you been bra?

i just spoke to someone who said they would make sure you get in for an 
interview.  i will know more in a couple of days.

Here's an update on the Fall league. Once you have a list of people
(hotties) who want to play, sent it to me and I'll make sure our team is
stacked.

Pass this on the Brian Hull.

I hope everyone enjoyed themselves this past season!!
As for me, despite the mood I was in during our loss Tuesday, I did
actually have fun!  Sorry for being such a d---head!!

Anyway, on to more positive stuff.... I have decided to put myself through
this one more time (no Winter league for me!), but I need your help.
Please let me know the following...

     - if you are interested in playing full-time in the Tuesday night Fall
coed league that will begin Oct. 3rd
or
     - if you are only interested in being a sub

Remember, the cost of the team is fixed and each person's share is
determined by the number of people paying, so please only commit if you
will be coming out to play (and pay).

Please reply by next WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27th.  I will not assume that you
want to play unless you send me a confirmation email.

Thanks,
Roy

i still owe you $30 right?

it is good.  it isn't his best.  wait until you get to glamorama.  so you 
have us set up for the 30th.

It's on Tuesday - it's in the email, even though the subject line of the
email was wrong.

Sara-

I am sending the resume of a friend of mine who I think is a good candidate 
for the associate program.  Please get back to me and let me know what else I 
need to do to get him in for an interview.  Thank you for your help.

Matt Lenhart

what does mmmcchhhaaa mean?  is that the scary sound from friday the 13th?  
things have been good.  just been working a lot and living it up a little.  
that is great that you started teaching 4th grade.  i watched florida play 
last week.  they got lucky.  we will have to make a bet on the lsu-flor 
game.  i will take the points of course.  i will let you think of the bet 
since you are into that stuff.  i went out with jen & max in denver.  i guess 
they are back together.  what is a good smaller town in florida to live in.  
one with golf courses right on the ocean.

anne-

any luck with those np & sp/ on-off peak curves?  let me know when you get  a 
chance.

thanks,

Here's a potential candidate for your opening.  Let me know if you're

If you are, then I'll make sure the candidate is interested in the position

i am glad you reminded me b/c i completely forgot.  this couldn't come at a 
better time b/c i am fucking broke.  i haven't been this since school.  send 
it to:

1212 fairview #a
houston, tx 77006

wait until you get to glamorama.  it is the best except for 1 nasty chapter.  
you will know when you get to it.  lsu is on espn this sat night.  look for 
me tied on to some 19 year old hottie  drunk off my ass.  i will have some 
pledges tie around my head and bourbon all over the front of my shirt.  just 
go ahead and over night that check.

they figured it out.  it was their mistake.  how is everything.  i am going 
to baton rouge this weekend for the lsu game.  i should be fun.  i will call 
sunday.

i think that i am going to take it easy tonight.  i am going to br tomorrow 
so i need my rest.  are you going to the lsu game?  i cannot wait to get back 
in town.  where are you guys going out afterwards?

we have a softball game chief

i don't know but the field is located off of i-10

so i will take minn (1.5).  you want that?

san antonio and vidor

did you get in  touch with kim

you must be bad luck for the tigers.  was it fun last weekend?  i havent 
heard of lz's.  what do you guys  have 8 happy hours a week?    

i was just in town over labor day weekend.  my hoodlum friends and i didn't 
get into too much trouble.  so do you have to learn new "internet terms"  in 
your new job.  you need do be able to talk the talk with those it folks.    
well the job sounds good if you are going to retire in one year.  i think i 
am going to work until i am 40 then i am moving to florida to live on the 
beach.  so how is denver?  i miss the good weather.  have you guys been 
partying?  did you have any good gossip for me.  you need to fill me in b/c i 
am way out of the loop.  good luck with your new job and email me back when 
you get a chance.

matt

is this going to be the buying op for apple?  

i couldn't believe it when i heard it.  i would just hold it.  i am going to 
baton rouge this weekend.  hope all is well.  take care.

we are playing tenn.  they are going to hammer us.  i am going in.  it should 
be on at 530 espn your time.  griese and davis starting sunday?

do you have an extra glove?  also let me know where the game is at tues.  
what is the next game you are going in for?

i am in if our football game is at 9

i got min -1.5 for $30

bama is a definate.  just call me tomorrow and we can go out there.  i hope 
there is a hottie working 1st.  i will hit singles all day.

i am in.

the lsu game rocked.  davey hasn't been playing b/c he has been hurt.  if he 
would have played last week we would have beat uab.  denver defense sucks.  
that game made me sick.  i can do can cun for sure.  just let me know the 
dates.  what happened to cu?  i heard marcus houston hurt his hip.

it was awesome.  i didn't get your message until last night.  i didn't have 
my phone with me there.  it was so much fun.  that was one of the greatest 
games that i went to.  where did you watch it?  it sounded like you were 
partying some.

i will be in for cancun for sure.  

i guess that means we need to go back to some more games.  i cant believe we 
didn't go.

when are we going to go get drinks with celeste's friend that is the hottie?  

how about that game?  did you get to see it?  tell celeste to set it up for 
thurs.  we will go hit some cool place for drinks.

i went.  it was incredible.  one of the best games i have seen there.  rohan 
is the man.  we would be 4-1 if he could have played last week.  big game 
sat.  we need to do something for the game.

what do you mean i wasn't doing so hot saturday night?  i thought i was in 
great shape.  i was dancing better than menudo.  i was hurting when we left 
sat.  i almost puked in my car when i was driving back to houston.  going 
back to football games is so much fun, but the drinking kills you.  i haven't 
drank that much for that long in a while.  it was worth it.  i am tired 
today, but it is nice for everyone to say how we kicked ass this weekend.  i 
still can't believe you didn't get tickets.  i had extras.  i could have 
hooked you up.  i heard brittney spears was at fred's on sat night.  did you 
hear that.  not that i am a fan of hers, i just heard that.  shoot me another 
email when you get a chance.

matt

yeah.  you?  we have an extra day also.  i want to go out sat.

sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i went to bed.  i will try to call 
you tonight or tomorrow.

sounds good.  how long would we stay in cancun?  i don't think i can take 2 
weeks again this year.  i could meet you in n.o. and we could fly from there 
or if you have to go to cancun through houston i can meet you here.  i will 
try to call tonight after my softball game.  hope all is well.

have you ever been to monterey, cali?  i get to go there in two weeks for a 
pipeline meeting.  it looks gorgeous.  is grandma still staying in town with 
you?

you said some embarrassing things on the message.  just kidding.   this 
weekend will probably be low key.  i am sure i will go out sat.  what are you 
doing?

i am down in the crowd somewhere.

i dont remember monterey.  i think i missed it when i was curled in a ball in 
the back seat freezing my ass off.  i cant wait.  i looks awesome.

i am playing golf one day.  i am going to fly into sf and drive down the 
coast to monterey.  should be nice.

i ran on the field.  it looked awesome.  i had a blast.  it was one of the 
top 3 games  i saw at tiger stadium.

it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well.  anyway, men get 
distinguished as they age.  i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep 
my hair.  i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed.  that is 
the best time to be at that place.  i do feel better at work today.  i found 
out i get to go to monterey, cali in two weeks for a boondoggle.  it is all 
paid for and all i will do is booze and golf.  i look foward shit like that 
now.    you should be going out every night while you can.  one day you will 
hit the real world and you can't do that.  lsu is not the real world.  you 
can still party a lot while you work, you just have to be in pain at work and 
pretend like you are not hung over so they don't think you have a problem.  i 
usually go out 2-3 nights a week.  i try to live like a rock star (like 
britney spears).  email me back when you get a chance.

what is up?  i didn't have your email.  anyway, i think you called last night 
and i answered and i could hear you talking to somebody, but you couldn't 
hear me saying hello.  dirty george does some sick shit.  he lost his hand up 
his ass the other day.  how is the new job?

we need to book a trip to club med can cun.  i heard it is just like that 
show temtation island.

are we on for drinks with the hottie?

cool bra.  what is up for the game this weekend?

do you get to go to ny ever?  sounds good.  are you going to start working 
100hrs/wk?

i have a joke for you.

Q:  what two words clear out a men's bathroom faster than anything?

A: nice dick

i don't listen to nsync.  i like color me bad more.  they are more my speed.  
they have a more mature sound.  you don't know what a boondoggle is?  a 
boondoggle is where another company takes you on trip to discuss business 
over golf and booze.  they pay for it all and it is usually fairly 
extravagant.  they make this job worth it.  i am having a shitty day.  i am 
losing a shit load of money.  do you go out every night or something?  you 
are living the wild life.  what are you taking the gre for?  what the fuck is 
the gre for anyway?  is that the grad school test?  what is your major?  i 
can't remember what you told me.  speech something?  where are you going to 
grad school? lsu?  talk to you later.

you must be a hoodoo for the tigers.  i went in for the tenn game.  it was 
awesome.  you dont realize how good we had it at school until you leave.  
check out md anderson.  it is the top cancer research hospital in the 
country.  how is everything going there?  i talked to our babe kelsey walker 
a couple of weeks ago.  she was in houston for a bachelorette party.  she is 
still hot.   i also saw  brooke and emily last weekend.  brooke looked good.  
i am planning on going to jacques wedding.  when is it?  what lsu games are 
you going back in for?  i am definately hitting the bama game and possibly 
miss st.   talk to you later.

i spoke to her yesterday.  if she doesn't get you an interview with that guy 
she is going to get you one later.  game at tim or val's.

sounds good. 

we can bring some shit.  is this girl from the same town as celeste?  i am 
trusting you that she is hot.  i don't want to show up for some drinks and 
have to sit next to some troll.  well just let me know.  we can get drinks 
any night next week.

i think mitch is going to come over also.

i have your juvenille cd & i might not give it back.  you in town this 
weekend.

i just got a 46.  my mom is so proud she raised a good boy.

see how you do on this test.  let me know your score.

pretend some of that stuff didn't happen.

i actually scored a 96.  that is respectable.  it doesn't make me a dope 
addict or dog lover so i am comfortable with it.

i didn't cheat like you did.  there is no way your score can go down on 
this.  i think you need to retake it and be honest with the test and be 
honest with yourself.  let me know what you really score.

did you see the debate last night?  i was impressed with cheney.  i thought 
he was more impressive than either presidential candidate.

wade might show up if that is ok

i tell him to bring some food

i am not going fucking ice skating.  that fag might be.  i think there is a 
power trader named rogers herndon.  why?  so what are you doing this weekend?

we should go get some beers after work at that new place near tim called the 
station or something.  let me know if you are in.

i am staying in town for the weekend.  what are you doing?  i think that i am 
going out sat.  give me a call if you are going out.

whenever.  i am ready to go now.

you won't be able to throw me when you are on ice skates boitano.

give me a call at work or at home when you can go.

i didn't bet with her.  she still owes me $50.  we came back to reality.

you didn't miss shit on saturday.  merc room was full of nothing but 
cougars.  it was a waste.  we need to hit this place called toc.  i heard 
that it is great.  

texas sucks huh?  how was your weekend?

do you guys want to play golf sat morning?  let me know and i will get a tee 
time before the game.

somewhere decent.  if you want in i will get a tee time today.

damn!  you got a 112?  did you answer yes to the animal sex question?  i 
scored lower than you.  i scored a 96.  my mother would be proud.  i am just 
an angel.    you should move to the french riviera.  i think i am going to do 
something similar.  i need to go anna nicole and marry a rich old woman and 
move to the carribean.  i think i could quit work and become some old blue 
hair's boy toy.  i would only be a couple of years.  i would probably be able 
to get a girlfriend on the side who is more my age.  all i would really have 
to do is get on a different sleeping schedule than her and i could totally 
avoid her.  fuck working.  i don't want to use my mind.  i think that is what 
i am going to work on this weekend.  i can go volunteer at some old person 
place and find a honey.  sounds like a plan.  talk to you later.

is excel (psco) going bankrupt?  have you heard anything about that?

she lies

i don't think i can make it b/c we have a west desk dinner that night.

there was nothing but blue hairs there.  all the chicks were lying about 
their age.  i needed to escape that place.  my hair looks great today.

they are getting tighter.  my new diet seems to be working.  i need to drink 
more water so my skin will get smoother.  

thanks.  i might check it  out.

Here are the prices.  Let me know if you need any other points.

sure. i will give you a call before i pick you up.

how much does the league cost for softball

i don't know what time i will be back.  i need to do cardio after work and 
then eat.  you still up for golf sat?  i will get the tee time tomorrow.  

i have a tee time for 5 on sat @ 12:07 if you want to play.  the tee time is 
at herman golf course.  let me know today if you want in.

i don't think we bet, but i will give you the benefit of the doubt.  since 
florida won that makes us even.  here is the math:

you owe me 50
i owe you 50
net = 0

florida's math dept. must not have been that stellar.  so you and max are 
buying a house together?  that is good to hear.  i don't know what i am doing 
for thanksgiving.  one of my buddies from school is getting married that 
weekend and i might just go to that.  what else is new in denver?  you still 
selling drugs?  so who is going to be the bread winner, you or max?  i have 
been meeting some girls.  a lot of cougars.  cougars make me laugh b/c they 
think they are a hot commodity or something.  where are you and max going to 
buy?  does he still like the 5 points area?  that isn't exactly mayberry.  
well practice your math and keep in touch.

i have a dinner to go to

i was having my toenails buffed, but i watched it.  i am heading downtown sat

are you in love?  what is his last name? claven?

 well i am glad you are happy.  how is work.  i have been getting my ass 
kicked lately.

i work out at the met.  i am trying to turn into an adonous.  i need to do 
more sit ups, eat more chicken, and drink more water.  

you guys want to do this?  i will play.

i wanna be a gooder speller.

i got a tee time sat at 10 am.  the course is cypresswood.  let me know if 
you are in or out.

how is everything going?  did you have fun in denver?  how about the 
cornhuskers.  they seem to be getting by barely.  it should be interesting as 
they play better teams.  have you been golfing?  i haven't golfed in a long 
time, but  i am going saturday.  i am also going to california next week and 
will golf there.  give me a call this weekend if you get a chance.

i thought i heard something but i wasn't sure.  i just didn't buy it.  how is 
everything going?

let's try that new place main station tomorrow night instead of kinneally's.  
it is a block from the dog house.

i have to work through the 26th of dec.  i can start vacation on the 27th.  i 
think that is the day you said you wanted to head to cancun.  let me know 
when you get a chance.

here is a good excuse to get out of that concert:  lsu football game at 7.  
you don't need to mention to them that we are going to tear up downtown 
afterwards.  no holds barred is the motto this weekend.  

i have to be here on the 26th.  i don't think we get that day off.  if we do 
have the day off  i can do whatever.  they guy i trade the northwest is going 
to be out of town, that is why i have to be here.

i will check the vacation schedule.  i don't know if i have the 26th or the 
24th off.  i will find out today.

you got to make her forget that dude.  your money

we went out too late.  there were enormous lines to get into each place.  it 
sucked.  we need to get there earlier.   i might not be able to play tomorrow 
night.

she cannot play on the team now.  she coaches or something like that.  i 
don't think bryan will be at the game either.  lisa should be there.

i might be able to make it.  i will know tomorrow.  are you in town this 
weekend.

why?  doesn't soy clean the pipes?

are you in if it doesn't?

are you staying in town this weekend?  

so are you going to get that car?

that is scary.  

that is just gross

i should be at the game tomorrow night.

looks like she is going to play

i am in for the happy hour

check this out.  it is a beau rivage special

http://www.mgmmiragevacations.com/bestbeau1.htm

double or nothing means  if  i win you pay me 100  and if i lose we are 
flat.  do you remember you lost $50 to me on jan 1?  your math is bad.  our 
bet isn't if i win you owe me $100 and if you win i owe you $100.  that 
doesn't make sense.    you need to stop sniffing the glue.  how is the house 
hunting going?  so are you and max going 50/50?  i haven't met all cougars.  
i met a little hottie who is an education major.  she is still in school.  i 
am going young so when i get married i wont have to turn her in as early.  
cougars don't have a long marriage expectancy if you marry someone who wants 
to trade you in when you are really old for a younger model.  geaux tigers.

sounds good.

what is up party girl?  i heard you are quite the dirty dancer.  

are you playing softball tonight?

what field are we on tonight?

i will just meet you there

good one

do you know who the winner is?  i bet you want to go out with him b/c he has 
a new truck & boat.

yeah.  nothing turns me on like a woman in a truck.  does she have rebel flag 
stickers on the truck and calvin peeing on a ford symbol sticker?

there is chinese food up here.  i think i am going to run down to the 
delivery van and free the dogs out of the back.

i heard you were throwing a huge halloween party.

i don't understand your rationale in this bet.  i was up $50 going into our 
bet, you were down $50.  for me to now be down $100 is a $150 swing.  why 
would i risk $150 vs. you risking $50?  florida's math dept. is lousy.  when 
are you and max going to vegas?  i just got back in town from monterrey, ca.  
it was another boondoggle for work.  here is a stock tip for you: pxlw.  
check it out.  also ene.  very strong long term.

we need to figure out something to do for halloween on sat night.

30-40

he is going to get hurt.  your forgot that the saints are cursed.

it is a 2:30 game.  if we win i am at fred's right after.  fuck eating.

what time the game tomorrow?

we need you back for softball.  we need a catcher.

texas did go to a bowl last year and get run by an arkansas team (sec) that 
was blanked 35-0 in their last regular season game against lsu.  big 12 can 
say they are up this year, but the fact is there are only two teams playing 
football in that conference, ou/nu.  the other teams in the big 12 attribute 
their loses to a competitive conference from top to bottom.  i think they 
should change the name of the conference to the big 2.  at least the sec is 
full of good teams.  "the big 12 - you can't shine shit!"

are we hitting sierra tomorrow?

we do need a rivalry.  we can get a new rivalry and write a fight song about 
that team.  that will take us over the top.

i have no plans for halloween.  what are you going to do?  i was thinking 
about just throwing a pre-party and then hitting the bars.  let me know what 
you think.  

Mr. Jacoby-

I wanted to see when was a good time to meet with you regarding the PRC 
process.  Any day next week during the afternoon would be best for Phillip 
and I.  Get back to me when you can and we will set up a date and time.

Thank you,

Matt Lenhart

i haven't thought about what i should be.  i need to think about it.  i will 
let you know.  what did you have planned for saturday?

you going out tonight?

i didn't go to br.  i was in monterrey, cali and didn't get back until late 
fri.  what are you doing sat night for halloween?  i haven't seen you in a 
long time what has been going on?  i need to think of a good costume.  maybe 
i will be another mullet, just a different kind.  how is the job?    

you hate gollata huh?  fights are a waste of money b/c they are never good.  
i made my mullet wig.  it is a work of art.  i look like such a tool with it 
on, but my legs are still great.  i like my ankles too.  so you are just 
going to hit that party sat?  what else have you heard that might be going 
on?  i love halloween.  it is a lot of fun dressing up and getting drunk.  
let me know what you hear of.  

i don't shave my legs, but honestly - i like those op shorts.  if you know 
where i can get some let me know.  i don't have an alchohol problem you do.  
what is aa like?

you have to be creative.  didn't you take arts and crafts?  i thought women 
were good at that.

if you are going to the one in the village i think you should try another 
place.  there is this place called chipotle on kirby two blocks down from 
bissonet.  it is the best.  they are out of denver.  it is much better than 
texadelphia. 

i might have to be another form of mullet.  i will think of something for sat 
and let you know.

these are not like mission burrito.  i hate mission burrito too.  these are 
healthy.

you cant go off of what coulon says.  that guy cant eat anything.

i wish i could go every day.  i could live on it.  we will go some time.

no.  i am up for having people over and then heading out on sat.  if we get a 
big group together and go out it could be a good night.

you getting out early?  you going out tonight?

i am going to take that friday off and come in to br.  maybe we should set up 
a tee time around 2 or 3 pm.

i didn't say we were having a party, i said you were having a party.  i will 
spread the word at the analyst happy hour tonight.  i will let them knwo that 
you will provide drinks and food.  does susan know about your party?

we lost.  i hate playing softball.  it is no fun.  people are going to be 
upset with you if you plan a party and then bail out on it.  susan won't like 
the fact that you didn't tell her about it.  how is nyc?  have you hit the 
clubs yet?

what is going on?  i have missed some good games.  i wanted to go in last 
week, but i was out of town and didn't get in until late fri night.  i think 
i will be in for the bama game.  how old is your friend that is getting 
married?  a lot of my friends are starting to get engaged.  i can't believe 
everyone gets hitched so young.  what else is new? 

sounds like your working hard.

lets get it on!

ditto

The Continental Club is located at 3700 Main Street, between Alabama and 
Holman.

See you tomorrow!

i get free lunch every day

what two words clear out a men's bathroom?

scroll down

nice dick

we are playing liars poker right now if you want in.  give me a call later if 
not.

stop the bad joke respnses and the fag 'miss you much' , 'love you much' 
messages please.

you're the seat saver

i will buy 2 for sure.

i got two tickets on the 50

you cant lose 30 points from the last time you took it.  you have to be 
honest. you are just lying to yourself

they better not lose to the fucking aints.  i don't want to be emabarrassed.

i just got a 28

i got an 86.  

we need to think of something for halloween.  have you heard of anything?

,   

we went to scudieros.

you weren't there.

i was a man whore

it was pretty cool.  just some 70's shit.  lot of gold.

bob shiring got canned

i am an independent contractor.

how was dallas?  any good stories?  did you get married to your babe?

i think you see the writing on the wall that we are going to dominate.  who 
cares about the last two years, it is about now.  we are going to rope-a-dope 
ya.

are you going to ride in with us fri?  let me knwo.  we are going to leave at 
12.  this is going to be a party weekend.  i am going to live on red bull.  
give tim a shout at 853-4755.  i cannot make the game tomorrow night.  i will 
be at the rest of them.

i will not be able to make it this week.  i will be at the rest of them.

is this in response to the unfunny email responses

i'm flakin

i will try to do that tomorrow

i can't go to the game tonight.  i have other plans.

yeah.  i am throwin a rager that starts at 6:30

mitch needs to know if you guys and that other girl are playing tonight.  let 
me know & i will email him.

the team needs you.  do it for the team.

lisa said she would play if she gets out of work on time.  i haven't been 
able to get ahold of bryan.  i would doubt the other chick would play, but if 
she does let me know what she looks like.

tell him to keep checking his mail and it might be there in a couple of 
weeks.

i suck at softball and i hate playing it.  i have a ' team building' thing at 
the rockets game.  

Mr. Skilling-

Here are a few questions I would like to submit before your floor meeting on 
the 32nd floor  Wednesday.

1.)  Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking 
assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in 
new markets.  Is Enron going to be just a trading company?

2.)  If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite 
volatile.  How could this affect our stock price?  Will Wall Street be 
prepared to accept more volatile earnings?

3.)  Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and 
new platforms are being introduced into the market place.  Is this going to 
have a negative effect on Enron's stock price?

4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near 
future?

5.)  Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of 
our stock price is based on broadband?

I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to 
discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Matt Lenhart

i thought it was a funny comeback larry

tonight?  i am going to a basketball game.  i heard people go out and trick 
or treat on this night or egg kids.

lame reply 

lame reply #2

thanks.  have fun egging the neighborhood kids

lame response #3

did kendra play

if your responses are witty then that tells me wit means retarded and unfunny 
responses.  are you going to sit ryan and i down and tells us how to give 
stupid responses to every email that comes out?

soy is discusting

the gas daily pricing is the correct one.

those guys can party

did you guys win

bobby shiring in the newest member of ees

do you still like apple?  looks pretty safe down here.  p/e is only 9.  what 
do you think?

bob was canned last week.  not suprisingly.  i will try to call you guys this 
weekend.

ou was impressive.  crouch sucked after the 1st quarter.  i think they told 
bob " don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. "  he was a nice 
guy, but didn't produce.  he once said to me " if i didn't have this goddam 
kid i could retire".  his kid less than 1 year old.  talk to you later.

it said if you do that it is bad luck

i told you he would.  it wont be easy, but for a year you would learn a lot.

i will try to line up a pig for you 

lets meet tonight at 8

how was sat night?  i tried to call your house but the number isn't in 
service.

done. see you there

no.  it just means someone has a lot of ammo.  it isn't from that movie.

hey mom,

i will check on dates today.  i can probably come home the 23rd or 24th.  how 
was your weekend?  i went to baton rouge and watched lsu play.  i couldn't 
find cros anywhere.

i looked for cros but i couldn't find him.  i told him where i would be and 
i  was there the whole time.  my cell wasn't working on campus.  i gave him a 
call today to find out how we missed eachother.

i will check on whether or not i am going to go to new orleans or not.  i 
might go to dallas for new years if lsu goes to the cotton bowl.  i will find 
out soon.  best thing might be for me to fly back to houston on the 28th or 
29th and if i go to new orleans i can just drive in.

broncos will roll the aints.

broncos just need to keep griese out of the french quarter on saturday night

how about them tigers?  6 wins with 2 games to go.  let me know when you want 
to pay off that bet.

it was fun.  i am tired now.  josh was wearing a ut shirt.  i think we are 
going to end up playing texas in the cotton bowl.  i think i would be an 
ass-whoopin' like texas never had.  what did you do this weekend?  

how is dean's.  looks like a cool place.  how great would it be to party in 
dallas on new years eve and then begin the year by kicking texas' ass again.  
that would all major sports.  what is up for this weekend?

no.  i was dead on sat night.  i was out late on fri.  it was fun.  you 
should have stayed out.

you lost to stanford and haven't beat any good teams.  texas has no running 
game.  they are too easy to defend.

what is bounce?

i would rather throw myself off the enron building and bounce on the cement

give me a call again.  i lost your work number

i can't open these dirty porn cartoons at work.  how is everything going?  i 
haven't heard from you in a while.  max and jen just bought a house from my 
brother.  what are you guys doing for xmas?  or chanuka?  lsu might end up 
playing florida in the sec championship.  look out.  let me know  how things 
are going.

i can make it if we are the 7:30 game.

cros-

just wanted to shoot you an email.  let me know if you are going to get down 
to new orleans.  also, lets keep in touch on some of these real estate 
deals.  i am very interested in getting into some of these projects.  good to 
talk to you again.

matt

Cooper- 

I wanted to know if you could send down the foward curves for SP, NP & PV.  I 
also wanted to know if I can access these curves daily here in Houston.  Get 
back to me when you get a chance.  Thanks for your help.

Matt Lenhart

could you send me a copy of those current curves.

i thought i got a copy from you last time.  i will check with ricter.

if you sign up on msn messenger brian hoskins is on there as "mr. right".  he 
was signed up as that on the trading floor msn list.  i couldn't believe it.

bring the money by whenever you want.  i should be at my desk all day.  

call 853-0661 and say his name and you will get connected to his ext.  if it 
rains will the game get cancelled?

you lost, you need to pay me.  part of losing the bet my man.  where are you 
working now?

is there still a game or a number we can call?

let me know when you can meet in the lobby and i will go down there

i can't get down there by the end of the year.  so you are finally going to 
get a job?  that is good.  why cant your state get all their votes in?  if 
they don't vote for bush i am going to be so pissed.  sounds like max and jen 
bought a big house.  we might need to make a bet on the lsu-flor game in the 
sec championship.  

When do you want to reschedule this meeting?

way to show up for the game.  we had to get a ringer, but she was pretty 
good.  she is one of those softball freaks that goes out every tues night 
looking to pick up games.

call me before you go down  3-7176

we lost by 1 i think.  i can't wait until softball is over.  i cant stand the 
two older guys on the team.  one of them got mad and was kicking a trash can 
and throwing his glove around.  don't leave me hanging out there again with 
some of those freaks.  i can't take it.

can i reserve 2 tickets?

thanks.

i think i will go with the cheaper tickets.  thanks for offering up those 
tickets.  it  is going to be an expensive weekend.  how about this election?

larry's uncle had some but they are like $50.

you need to send a warning with that

Jeff-

can you send down a foward curve for sp, np, and pv?  also, where can i get 
these curves daily?

lsu +3.5

i have to meet with h.r. today.

i think that we might go to two rows to watch the game b/c they have better 
food.  why don't you guys meet us there.  where did you end up in b.r.?  i 
went to fred's and bogies.  it was pretty fun.  

hey grandma-

how is everything going?  is it cold in neb?  it really got cold here last 
night.  my windows frosted over.  how is neb going to do against ksu this 
weekend?  i think that they will roll them.  ksu isn't that good.  give me a 
call when you get a chance.

love matt

how was saturday?  you didn't miss anything at uropa.  

how could you vote for gore?  especially if you want to become a teacher.  i 
am not scared to go to florida, i just haven't done it.  lsu might play 
florida in the sec championship which would be in dec.  we wont know that for 
two more weeks.  how else is everything going?  i am just keeping busy with 
work and partying.  get back to me when you get a chance.

i am just kidding.  those people were huge huh?  what has been going on with 
you?  are you hitting the town tonight or is it too hard to do that with your 
new job?

definately let me know when you come into houston.  there are a lot of fun 
bars around town here.  what happened to you on sat?  i was hurting on suday 
driving back.  that is the worst part of going back.  i heard oxford is fun 
to party at, but the fans there are assholes.  have a good time and keep in 
touch.

Hey, man, I just forward the things.
I don't write 'em.

They pay me to wave the flag along the highway, not screw with email.
By the way, shouldn't you guys be passing gas or power or whatever it is you
guys pass?

I'm not sure I ever sent you this, but its from my honeymoon...

other 2
 guys?

 Frickin' hilarious - maybe you saw this last night during the
election.  It
 was on one the major networks, I don't remember which one, though.
Be sure

i love saban.  he is the best coach in college.  i just said i like rohan 
better than booty.  you guys partying this weekend?

that is the saddest response i have heard.  teachers should be continually 
tested.  i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their 
incompetence.  you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your 
job and half way competent.  democrats are so lazy.  how could you vote 
democrat?  al gore makes me sick.  enough of my ranting and raving.  what are 
you doing this weekend?  i am tired today b/c i went out last night.  this is 
a good scene.  probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now 
and our downtown is booming.    name some small towns that are cool to live 
in near south florida.  i heard naples is great.  i need to live on the 
ocean.

i am painting purple and gold tiger stripes all over my body.  

bush.  dick & bush - it is just natural.  what are you doing this weekend?  
lsu is on espn2 at 7 your time on sat night.  how much snow did the mountains 
get?  get ready for n.o.    

i am up for going out wherever.  ricky hasn't been producing too many 100 
yard games lately.  our bet could go either way.  give me a call on my cell @

i doubt cros will end up going.  sat night is val's engagement party.  i just 
want to stay there for maybe an hour.  where are you watching the game 
tonight?

cooper-

are you guys having trouble pulling the hourly iso data?  if not, let me know 
so i can get this query fixed.  it is missing data for certain days and data 
for imports/exports.  thanks for your help.

matt

julie-

is that product updating daily for you?  if it isn't we have some term 
products for calendar year 2002 or 2003 that wouldn't have to be updated.  
let me know if you need those products on your site.

i love natural gas

i cannot make it tonight.  i have a customer dinner.

not that type of gas- i love the natty

pretty good.  who is going out sat night?

dean's is cool.  i went there thurs.  i went to prague not to long ago.  it 
was pretty cool, but not somewhere i would hang out every sat.  i didn't do 
anything this past weekend b/c i think that i am getting a cold.  if we don't 
do dinner sat night let's definately meet out somewhere.  we need to explore 
downtown some.  how is the new job?  are you working 100 hours/wk?

photo from the gas trading floor.  you can see me in the photo.  i am at the 
top under the second flat screen on the right.  i am blurred so you can't 
really tell it is me.

we are going to hit woody's tonight if you are interested

i wish i could come up too, but i am going to head to that wedding.  i need 
to leave fri morning.  it is going to stay cold there until next week.  check 
out that article.  i haven't read it yet.  i will call this weekend b/c i 
will not be home tonight.

the one across from the pink pussycat.  hull and i are meeting there around 
9.30.  i think there should be a lot of folks there.  give me a call on my 
cell and we can meet up there.

get in touch with me if you guys come in on saturday.  we are planning on 
going out downtown most likely.  you can call me on my cell at 713-8258410 or 
at home at 713-807-1699.  should be a good weekend to be here.  i think there 
is a lot going on.  email me back.

grandma-

nebraska sure got lucky.  cu choked at the end.  looks like lsu could end up 
playing nebraska in the cotton bowl.

did i spell disgusting wrong?  at least i didn't put it in a book for the 
world to see.  i have never had any of that stuff.

i went in and changed it.  

i told her i was busy and don't call me.  i gave her my digits and told her 
to call.

did you make it to woody's?  it was all poles and no holes when i was there.  
we are going to hit kennelleys after work if you are up for it.

i didn't get your message until i got home.  we will probably head over there 
around 5 or earlier.  i will give you a call before we head out.

we will be there around 5

what is going on?  i figured that you wouldn't be coming to houston due to 
the weather on saturday.  just let me know if you want to come in and we can 
hit the town.  i won't be in houston over thanksgiving or the following 
weekend.  actually, the following weekend i will be in new orleans.  my 
brother is coming in town and we are staying at my family's place in the 
quarter.  talk to you soon.

matt

that was epic.  i was so pissed i almost left the sports bar where i was 
watching the game.  we need griese back.  you ready for new orleans?  should 
be fun.  when are you getting there and what day do you leave?

our defense is holding us back.  they make me sick.  if we had a defense like 
baltimore we would be superbowl favorites.  i will try to fly in on that 
friday.  i am going to take fri and mon off.  

i got the message.  i didn't think you guys would make it.  i am going to new 
orleans to meet my brother and just go out.  we are just going to party in 
the french quarter.  my parents own a place down there so we have a free 
place to stay.  one of my friends is also having an engagement party that 
saturday that i have to go to.  if you guys want to party in new orleans give 
me a call b/c we will be down there from that fri through that monday.  i 
haven't gone out in the quarter in such a long time.  talk to you soon.

matt

hey-  chevys are nice, that is what i drive.  so tom came up to north dakota 
to steal your car and didn't even buy you guys dinner?  that kid has no 
class.  things are going well here.  i have been seeing some girl for awhile 
now.  other than that nothing is new.  enron is getting all its employees new 
computers so let me know what billie wants to do with the laptop that you 
guys gave me.  if you guys want it i can send it up, if not i will keep it 
still.  it is a very good cpu.  i think you guys should buy a new lincoln 
ls.  they are very nice cars and i don't think that they are too expensive.  
has grandma set a date for our vacation this summer?  any time is really ok.  
give me a call when you get a chance.  i will be home all weekend.

love matt

this doesn't have an attachment.  how about them seminoles!

i will be out of town for the game

i think i am going to fly in fri afternoon.  i am going to work in the 
morning and then leave.  call me here at work and i will give you the fax 
number.

i don't have that many roomates.  they just tell you that b/c you will 
believe anything.  did you call me last night?  if you did i will get back to 
you soon.  that is odd that your friend from la. is jewish.  you don't see 
that too often.  i will visit....sometime.  don't pressure me on that.

i will give you a call.  things are going nuts here right now.

after work there is a eol happy hour at the state bar.  hull said we could 
all go, so if you want in let me know.   i am heading there straight after 
work.

he's got room.  i will give you a call before i leave.

i am actually going to fly into new orleans next friday.  i arrive around 
6pm.  we can meet up at our place in the quarter when you guys want to come 
down.  i will try to give you a call next week.  i have to go to shreveport 
for thanksgiving.  one of my friends is getting married to a divorced lady 
with a kid.  the wedding should be fun except for the shreveport part.  i 
hate that place.  have a good time in lake chuck.  

i got an email from that chick and she and her roomate want to meet us out.  
we will be set up.

no thanks.  superbowl sunday is a big day for me.  i will go out this weekend 
so give me a call.

i got all our bills in.  i will write checks for all of them and you can just 
write me a check for your portion which is $138.38.  

i have the tickets for them that go in the envelopes, but i don't  have 
copies.  our bills our higher b/c our electric bill was up $25.  but i didn't 
keep copies.

i don't think i have the detail.  i am not adding uneccessary charges to your 
phone bill.  i tallied it up as i always do.  

i am up for it

you never used to check it.  i always threw it away after i tallied it.

those are fucking funny

anyone up for going out tonight?  let me know.

i don't think we will get killed.  we aren't as bad as we played this week.  
actually i have tried sushi and those beans are good but i hate the sushi.

we are going to meet some sluts

 ditto

i don't need another cpu.  the lap top that you guys gave me is very fast and 
i still use it all the time.  i will be home all weekend so give me a call 
when you get the chance.

did you get martha and billie's car?  did you give them something extra for 
hooking you up?  go to the web site www.adcritic.com and look at the fox 
sport commercials for the basketball promo.  there is one for the jazz, 
spurs, lakers and knicks.  they are hillarious.

did you see those commercials

they are so funny

I made a few changes from on the Socal forecast:

1.)  Put in the updated PV, NP, & SP power curves - now the generators are 
running at peak levels
2.) Increased Ehrenberg from 1.2 to 1.25
3.) Took off the weather adjustments when the new SP generation begins

The new forecast brings Socal storage to a max of 86 Bcf before Q3.  We can 
discuss this further on Monday.

Matt

did you guys play football yesterday

played paintball with people in risk.  it was a blast.  did you go out?  i 
had a date on fri but i didn't do shit on sat.  

i hear you.  i was a nerd this weekend.  

shirley.s.elliott@citicorp.com on 11/28/2000 12:32:55 PM
this is pretty funny.  when you want to try sushi, give me a call.  i'll tell
you all the good stuff to get and we'll try some soy beans.  they are so good
for you and taste good too!  they're a great snack -- tons of protein, very
little fat and carbs.  you spelled it "discusting."

my number is (713)807-1699

i cannot make this tonight

got plans with this girl who's bday is today

daddy has got to get laid

happy birthday.  is everyone there being nice to you today?  get a to go box 
of cake so i can eat some.  the website with the funny commercials is 
www.adcritic.com.  go to "syncronized slammin".  that is funny.  also check 
out the top 100 and look at "spoof- '88 aries" and "blind date".  let me know 
what you think.

it probably is coastal.  they merged not too long ago.

go to www.amihotornot.com.  this is funny.

you have got to get a computer that is out of the 80's to see the cool stuff 
i see

did they buy you guys new "used" computers?  when i got my car it was new to 
me even though it was used.  we are just a much more advanced company.

want to play liars?

my dad could beat up your dad

give me a call when you get a chance.  i got your message this morning.  i 
don't think i will get to austin for at least a few weeks so it would be best 
if you just mailed the check.

just send one check and i will write the check for all three.  i will try to 
get the detail sent today.

do this test and let me know your score

hells yeah

you up for golf sat?

playing sat @ 11:30.  you want to play liars poker later?

what is your ext. i will call you

get the key for the extra slave quarter so some of the girls coming fri have 
a place to stay.

we will play around 5 or 530

is this safe to open b/c i don't have a private office

rank and yank

i would but i am going to ruggles with that girl.  let s hit it hard on sat 
after golf.

i got your message last night this morning.  i was already asleep when you 
called.  did you go out last night?  i thought you were drinking and dialing 
me.  just kidding.  i will pick you up at 8:30 tonight.

fuck fri.  go out sat.

mci is mailing the bill so i will fax it to you when i get it.  just send 
that check this weekend b/c i am going to send in the bills.  also think of  
a good weekend for us to go up and party in austin.  mid feb is probaly the 
best.

is this safe to  open.  i don't want anymore of your porn

for someone who isn't into their birthday you sure are stretching out this 
celebration.  it is about as long as mardi gras.  830 isn't too late for me.  
i will be there with bells on.  when you become an adult, as i am, sometimes 
you get a little more tired.  and if you have to be at work at 7 am rather 
than 9 you get a little more tired.  where did your brother take you?

did you bring money

hopefully some can stay with us in the nice place and if any of them are ugly 
they can stay in the other place.

i don't get it

i gots to get PAAIID

i get it

what are you doing this weekend?

it is probably the second or third most important day of the year behind 
jesus's birthday and maybe superbowl sunday.  i had to throw a football 
reference in there.   my bad, 830 is a lot earlier than 9.  i think it is 
still dark at that hour.  well i would love to continue this fascinating 
dicussion but i need to get ready to play liar's poker.  i need to win some 
money so we don't have to wash dishes after we eat tonight.  see you at 830.

what are you writing thank you notes for?

i am sorry to hear that.  i had no idea.  i knew you told me he was ill.  are 
you ok?

i didn't know shirley's father died.  

if you ever need to talk just give me a call.  i can't imagine it would ever 
be easy even if you were expecting it.

www.adcritic.com.  go to syncronized slammin then check out coppertone burn, 
artificial butter, can of picante.  those are on the right of the first 
commercial.  then go to top 100 and see number 17, and blind date.

there is more than enough room.  there is parking just in the street 
somewhere.  you might be able to get rock star parking in the front of the 
place.  if not, just find some place out on the street.  no camo or bright 
orange and dont make duck calls all night.  i will be there at 6pm.  should 
be a good weekend.  see you soon.

matt

patty sullivan gets the numbers each day.  i think her report is out on the 
web each day.  check with her and you can get the numbers each day.

are you a superfan of football after that game?  that game was brutal.  i 
think you birthday was more important than yesterday.  how was your party?

oh yeah- i forgot we covered that the other night.  there is no question 
about your birthday and the superbowl unless denver plays.  i went to a 
buddy's house to watch the game and left at halftime b/c i had no interest in 
the game.  your favorite band was on at halftime.  i know you were excited 
about that.  so why don't you come over this week and watch 9 1/2 weeks.  

damn baby chill!   did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed this 
morning?  9 1/2 weeks isn't a dirty movie, it's a classic.  you will see.  so 
why don't you come over tomorrow.  but don't come too late b/c i can't stay 
up that long.  did you cry tears of joy when nsync was on?  i couldn't have 
made it in that band b/c i am too rugged.  those guys are little sallys.

how can you call those nerds beautiful.  the guy with the beard and the one 
with the dreadlocks are eye sores.  and those litte mos aren't more rugged 
than me.  i could kick all their asses.  anyway, why don't you come over 
between 7 and 8.  that will give me time to work out for the 8th time of the 
day tomorrow.

i owe you some money huh.  i forgot.  just send me you address again and i 
will mail the check tomorrow.

 i was thinking about that earlier.  i could have used the money.  i couldn't 
even stay for the second half.  i ate all that papa john's and my stomach 
almost exploded.  i will play you one hand of liars for it.

come on shooter

is the one with the curly hair the one that supposedly dates britney?  there 
is no way she would go out with a geek like that.  you can come over 
whenever.   you wont ruin my workout routine.

try this.  it is pretty cool to see your baby pic.

is your sister-in-law melissa richardson?

she is taking two guys i work with to the game tonight

i think so.  one of the guys seems to know her.

paul lucci.  he is the old guy i hang out with sometimes.

like 35 or something

go to aimr.com

no.  he is divorced though.  the other guy going is the one from a&m i told 
you about.  the old guy is hilarious.  he is the funniest person i know.

by the way, i never said anyone cheated

no.  i just don't want your sister in law telling these guys that i said 
that.  could ruin my rep.  you coming over at 730?

did you not go out sat?  

you guys still suck

you guys suck

we went to tim's but it was pretty lame.  i felt like crap.  i am glad i 
didn't make that party, but i heard susan was russian dancing again.

i bet you are dying to see this movie

you got to be 100% to go out

you know i can't leave early and skip my workout.  how am i gonna stay such a 
stud if i stop working out?  plus, i am having a fat day b/c i only worked 
out once yesterday.  

i cannot go tues night.  

never heard it but i like the sound of it.  this weekend i am going to new 
orleans and my brother is meeting me down there.  

are you tired?  will you do me a favor and at noon think of me touching you?

can't make it

a new site for lsu i heard about.  it might not be new to you, but if it is 
it is the most complete lsu recruiting page.

http://www.dandydon.com/index.html

i was tired, but don't worry i still had a good work out.  my legs are 
looking great.  you coming over again tonight?

did you ask that girl out?  if not go ahead and ask her out and we will make 
plans.  we can take them for margaritas then to galant night.

your sister in law was looking out for you last night by asking all these 
questions about me.

that website is funny.  it just returns a picture of a baboon.  i totally

i called her again and left a message.  i might need to go through someone 
else.

Dear Phillip Allen and Matthew Lenhart:

As you know, I am Matthew Lenhart's PRC representative. As such, I would
like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year
end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of
the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that
I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC.
Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby
Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is
that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if
needed.

If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at
x3-6173.

Regards,

Ben

Mr. Jacoby-

I wanted to see if we could set up a time to meet next week concerning my PRC 
review.  Let me know what your schedule looks like and we will try to meet 
when it is convenient.  Thanks for your time.

Matt Lenhart

she was just asking what i do at enron and if i am nice or an asshole.  she 
is just looking out for you.  hopefully these guys didn't bury me to bad.  
you know you loved that movie so don't pretend that you didn't.  it sounded 
like it was the 7th or 8th time you saw it.

hey grandma-

sorry i didn't call you on your birthday.  i hope you had a good one.  what 
else is going on?  i have just been working and hanging out with this girl.  
i will call soon.  dad said we have our reservations for the family vacation 
this summer.  i will call you tonight or tomorrow.

love matt

i am heading to new orleans this weekend to do some partying.  no uropa, just 
sluts in the quarter.  

happy belated birthday.  sorry i didn't give you a call.  what all did you 
get?  i will try to call you  tonight or something.  

i don't want to know about you and any other guys.  i don't need to think 
about that kind of bad stuff.  those guys just told her i was money.

you spoke with your sister?  what did they say?  

things are going well here.  nothing much is new in houston.  my life just 
seems to be work.  actually it is a lot of fun here.  mitch, val, and tim are 
here so we golf and go out a lot.  what are you doing at your new job?  did 
you change into a new field or just jump companies.  is natalie working?  
shoot me back an email when you get a chance.

matt

she will say that i am so money

they didn't say i was the coolest person they know at work?

i doubt that.  give me a call later.

did you go and sign up on that website?  there are a lot of people from our 
class on there.  what is going on?  how is san francisco?  can you pay your 
gas bill.  i trade energy in that area.  how is the nightlife?  are you 
dating at all?  life here is hectic.  i have just been working and going 
out.  when are you going home again?  i don't know when i will get back 
there, but i wish i was going back to ski.  shoot me an email when you get a 
chance.

let me know when you want to play liars.  next time i won't be as tardy.  i 
usually pay up quick.  glad you got your money.

where did you go last night?  is wednesday a happening night in denver?  did 
you pick up any talent?

i remember you.  you're not that old.  i am mature.

go to www.dandydan.com  or dandydon.  it is the most comprehensive lsu 
football recruiting site there is.

did you ask that ckick out for sat or not

let's do our bet tomorrow night.  i will give you 2 strokes.

i don't know.  what are you doing tonight?  call me later b/c i need to go 
film something for enron.  i am a movie star.

how is everything going?  what are you and al doing this weekend?  that is 
pretty funny.  i am glad you didn't put me in to the pic.

yes.  you need to come over more.

you need to b/c i can't have too many days like today.  you ready for an ass 
kicking like you've never had?  brink a jacket b/c i don't want to hear you 
complaining on the golf course. 

i won't be in a bad mood.  i will be excited to see you .

around 7:30

i never see sammy.  i ran into him on a thursday night about 2 months ago, 
but i have not seen him since.  the girl situation is good.  i have just been 
dating this girl from texas a&m, but she is not a die hard a&m freak so it is 
cool.  do you hang out with bert?  i can't believe he is getting married.  
talk to you soon.

i bet you could teach me something huh?

i don't think you are really good.  i think a little luck fell into your 
lap.  any time you want a shot at the title let me know.  i will leave work 
right now to go kick your ass at that game.

somebody posted a 2000 bmw for sale on the enron message board for $30k.   i 
think you should get it.

how much longer are you president of the board of realtors?  did you hear 
about aunt martha?  she is pretty sick.  she was in i.c., but i think that 
she is doing much better.

i might travel the country looking for games

told you she would get back to you today

did you ever send that check

i will give you a shot at the title when you get back

this weekend?  i think i am going to head out there on fri.    let me know 
when you want to go get a drink.

i need to get some tickets too.  there are a lot of people heading there on 
fri so we can all meet up some where.  we can figure it out towards the end 
of the week.

lets meet up at the rodeo.  i know enron has a booth and one of my buddies is 
bartending so we can get free drinks.  you can drink your cpa sorrows away 
fri.  it should be fun there.  i will get in touch with you on thurs or 
something to let you know what is going on.

you didn't think that was funny chief?

that sister comment was gross.  i didn't have a good day yesterday, but you 
can come over again tonight and try to give me some good luck for tomorrow.  
i am net up for the two times you have stayed over so i think we should keep 
it up.  did you watch your favorite show last night?  

i got extra tickets to the bbq.  i say we start drinking around 6.

bet

micha will pick us up at my place saturday @ 10:30am.   it is a long drive 
out there.

what is going on in denver?  are you and max finishing the details on your 
wedding plans?  i need to get everyone's email who is going to attend the 
bachelor party if you have them.  let me know if you have them and how 
everything is going.

the party together.  don't worry about it though b/c it will be clean fun.  
let me know if you have them and how everything is going.

matt

what kind of inside info?

okay i will answer your questions.  i made more money the first time you 
stayed over than i lost the second time you stayed over so i am net up.  here 
is a simple equation to explain:   2x -1x = x.    x is still positive.    i 
watched the show and i can't believe that i am that in to it.  so what are 
your rumors?  you have to tell now.

enron has been a piece.  looks like every company that deals in broadband is 
getting killed.  it is like they forgot we also do energy.

we will be there for about 1/2 hour to 45 min before tee off.

these videos are pretty good.  i saw the texas video the last two years.

go to www.mrfebruary.com.  i am not sure what it means, but i think that is 
the nickname for mack brown "mr. february".

it is such a sleazy show though.  and it is cheesy.  i am not cheesy, but i 
do enjoy it.   i thought you had some good rumors.  the equation was 
helpful?  sometimes it is easier to understand if you see the numbers.  come 
over tonight around 730ish or after friends since you don't want to miss that 
show.  

this is kind of gross, but it is real funny.  i don't think this is your type 
of humor, but girls here at work thought that it was funny so hopefully you 
will too.

might have a wedding in new orleans.  if i don't have to go to this wedding i 
will go to your engagement party.  things are good here.  i am still dating 
this girl that i was dating when i was home over xmas.  i guess we are 
boyfriend/girlfriend b/c she gave me the business last night on how she 
wanted to be treated and crap like that.  i like her though.  so how does 
that work for your wedding?  what all is the wedding party expected to pay 
for?  work is good.  i have just been working and partying.  email me back or 
i will call you and max this weekend.

you get home so i know if you are going to the rodeo tonight.  hopefully you 
can make it.  talk to you later.

you have to give me a second to reply.  so you are going to meet me there?  i 
can leave you tickets for the booth at my place or you can call me on my cell 
when you get there.    i will put your name on the list at the enron booth.  
my cell phone is 7138258410.  if i dont hear it call again.  if i don't hear 
it after the second time check the booth and i will try to put your name on 
the list.  did your friends say it was fun last night?  i will be drinking a 
lot tonight so don't give me grief like last time.  i am real sensitive.

for you around then.  i am going at 630 if you guys want to meet up then.

can definately get you in no matter what so if you don't want to go that 
early you dont have to.  let me know.  i am going to wear my cowboy hat and 
my bolla tie.

are you going to the rodeo tonight?

around there

.sounds good

yeah.  we will be at the enron booth.

i don't know what it is about having a girlfriend, but it is the best way to 
meet other girls.  is she hot?  maybe we could meet up one night or something 
like that.  how was your weekend?  i went to the cook off both nights and had 
a blast.  how old is this girl?

ask them when would be a good time for them to go to phoenix one weekend.  i 
would love to go visit them in phoenix and golf for 4 days.  just see when 
they can go and i will coordinate the trip.   i will call them tonight.

love matt

i will let you know.  if i play lets up the money to $10/hole.  you are so 
bad i don't think i can lose to you.

did he go out on sat?  that would make him a real champ.  

it was ok.  i spent a lot of time at the casino.  did you stay home or go to 
austin?  texas looked pretty good on friday.  how is your dad?

that is pretty bad since you suck so bad at golf

what is cheaper and when is the concert

do we need to wear disguises so we don't get killed?  lets get seat so we can 
sneak in booze.

lets get tickets

i don't think i will play on sat

i am just seeing this girl.  i has only been a couple of months.  lets all 
meet up one night and party.

it is only worth it for $10/hole.  you shouldn't even waste your money on a 
nice course.  you need lessons.  stop losing money to me and wasting your 
money at a nice course.  lessons will help.

i won $14

trying to get a head count on who wants to go to def leppard.   everyone 
knows they love def leppard so i don't want any replies making fun of me b/c 
i am going to the concert.  it is march 1st and it is gonna rock.   the whole 
thing is gonna be mullets and cougars so it should be fun.  let me know if 
you want to go.

i think i wrote down the wrong number.  call again.

i am in

everyone wants to go.  we will get a huge group to go.

you guys looked like you were discussing lots of interesting things.  i bet 
your boyfriend was upset.

when do we need to get tickets?  here is a list of people who want to go:
tim
bryan 
eric
shana
lisa
susan

i am just teasing you, but you did introduce us to some guy you went out with 
who is an analyst here.  i had so much fun on sat night.  it was crazy.

you said " this is my sweet baby"

saturday is better for me.  just let me know.

depends on the year.  generally around 10,000 miles a year.   don't get 
anything with more miles than that.  and if you are looking for something 
aroung 98 or 97 see if it is still under warranty.  you are such a shooter!  

my address is 

1212 fairview unit A 
houston, tx 77006

i think my mom's address is 

340 filmore
denver 80206   but i am not sure

i will try to call this week.  

just whenever.  i would rather go out as a group.

is anyone from denver going?  let me know what the guest list looks like.  i 
would love to go, but i need to check flights and all that stuff.

is that supposed to be funny?

i wanted to stay for a few weeks.  just kidding.  i am thinking 3-4 days.  
they is robbie and becky.  let me know what they say.

everyone wants to go

johnny cash is so  cool

lets buy 8.  i can put them on a credit card or whatever.

i was just kidding.  you are easy to tease.

looks like a deal.  i think i am going to go to your bachelor party and not 
miami.  i bet you are real excited about that.  lets set up golf for fri or 
sat.  you missed a good night on sat.

don't they have one every hour

that is good

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you

someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

is fine, just let me know.  should be a fun weekend.  we can head out 
downtown afterwards and hit some of the wierd clubs.  good luck with the rest 
of you finals.

matt

i got 6 tickets to the concert.  they are club level seats and should be 
pretty good.  we still need two and i can work on those b/t now and the 
concert.

club level

did you tell  her i have great ankles

i won't know until the tickets are delivered.

we might need 3 or 4.  i will get bass to get them

no.  i hate live music.  is this girl hot?  i don't want to meet her and get 
that dissappointed look on my face.

i didn't get them through the big e.  some punk broker.

that is secondary.  i am more of a face man.  just kidding.  kind of.

i will take your word for it.

happy valentines day.  i will see you tonight. 

nice email.  anyway, congratulations on your recent engagement.  max saved 
you from becoming a major cougar like your buddy stacey.  just kidding.  i 
was really happy for both of you.  as far a my responsibilities as the best 
man, i need to make sure that we send max out of the single life in style.  
don't worry, there will not be anything crazy going on with hired 
entertainment or anything.  how is work going for you?  must be going well 
since you and max just bought a big house.  i will be in town on dec 22nd so 
be ready to go out.

hey annie!   good to hear from you.  how is everything going?  do you have a 
valentine?  i have one.  it is a girl i have been seen for a few months.  you 
are so lucky you get to go skiing.  i wish i could hit the slopes.  i haven't 
skiied in over a year.  you do need a rich guy to support you in san fran.  
it is so expensive there.  you could just go anna nicole and get some guy who 
is almost dead and inherit all his cash.  you're not that type of girl though 
which is good.  who else lives up there.  i thought erin and her sister lived 
there also.  i can't remember.  keep in touch and stay warm there.  

matt

nice

can you record temptation island tonight?

you memorized the tv guide?  you really know your stuff.

there is a 1997 bmw 318 for sale here.  the price is $15k and i has 40K miles 
on it.  looks like it is loaded.

sluts?

told you i was sweet.  i will give it to you tonight.  

it says velvet metallic blue.  i have no idea what kind of blue that is.  it 
also says that it is still under warranty.  

sorry about leaving last night.  i know that was selfish.  you always stay 
over when it isn't convienient for you and i should have stayed.  i don't 
want you to think that i am trying to just walk all over you b/c i am not.  i 
did have a good time last night and i am sorry i ruined it at the end.  
hopefully you are not too mad.  email me later.

i will check today.  i received 6 yesterday.

i would be comfortable around stacey.  she is cool.  i took my girlfriend out 
to dinner and all i got her was a card.  we had a good time until i ruined it 
at the end of the night and now she is pissed at me.  i didn't stay over last 
night so she was pissed.  i understand though.  i don't think i can make it 
to miami.  i want to go but i have to attend a wedding of a friend from 
college.  actually, i am going to caymen the last weekend in march with my 
group from work so if you want me to check anything out let me know.  i will 
scout the island for you and max.  i will give you guys a call this weekend.  
take care.

i am in on another tee time for monday.  i would love to take all your money 
and some aggies's money, but i can't.  we will play again another time.

i was just being an idiot.  i was just thinking that i needed to be at work 
really early and that i needed to be at home.  it was stupid and selfish.  i 
feel really bad today b/c that is not the way to treat you.  i promise i will 
make it up to you.  

i am going to get a tee time for monday if you guys are interested.

i will get one for sun

you want in on sunday

we're done for sunday @ 12:30 at cypress lakes.  do you know anyone else who 
will play?

cool

wait for a little bit b/c i might have it filled.

0768

can you get me the rent check today?

your in

golf on sunday @ 12:30 cypress lakes.

there is no water.  just makes the name sound nice.

how do you want me to make it up to you?

you hate decisions

you are going to work me over for this aren't you?

i will take you out tomorrow night.  is that good with you?

so we are set to play golf at cypress lakes on sunday at 12:30.  we can meet 
up at 11:15 and get out there early to hit balls.  it is a pretty fun course 
to play and it has a lot of water on the front 9.  the back 9 is kind of 
dry.  should be fun.

i didn't piss her off at dinner.  i pissed her off b/c i didn't stay over 
that night after everything.  she was pissed and now i have to make it up to 
her.  that is ok.  so no one from denver is going to miami for your 
engagement party?  i wish i was going.  i would love to get to miami.  i will 
call you guys this weekend.

are we going out for your b day this weekend

anyone up for woody's tonight around 9:30?

that was hilarious.  i can't believe peta did that.

i was hung over yesterday.  i had a good time on sun.  i think you shot a 
126.  you would have had to shoot a 53 on the back and i think you shot a 60.

Elizabeth-

Do you still send confirms to counterparties for physical deals done day to 
day?  AEP has a problem with one of the confirms on a deal done Jan. 31.  
They sold us two packages of 5000 at PGE Citygate for 12.30 and 12.40.  I 
entered this as one deal for 10000 at 12.35.  They need the confirm to match 
their records for each deal.  If you could send another confirm I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks for your help.

Matt Lenhart

did that teresa lady call you yesterday?  she wouldn't talk to me at all 
yesterday.  her secretary said she spoke with you and she wouldn't take my 
call.  sorry i didn't call you to watch a movie last night.  i was dead from 
going out sunday and playing golf yesterday.  

how is everything going?  did you eat with robbie and becky?  i mentioned to 
grandma and grandpa a trip to phoenix some time this spring.  they also said 
that they were going to come to denver in may so i think i will come home for 
a little bit in may also.  call me when you get a chance.

that is fine.

Cooper-

I am having trouble running the database with the scheduled power info.  Let 
me know if you are having problems collecting the data.  

Thanks,

Matt Lenhart

thanks for your help.

Maria-

I work on the West Gas Desk in Houston.  Cooper said that you might be able 
to help me with a link we have to one of your databases that is not working.  
This link pulls the scheduled California loads, generation, and imports.  
This link has not worked since this morning.  Please let me know if you could 
help.  

Thank you,

Matt Lenhart

give him one of these " i dont love you whore, i'm out tha door".  just 
kidding.  that is bad.  that would make him feel cheap and used.  i just 
wouldn't respond.  he will get the point.  i was in pain on monday.  i 
couldn't believe i felt that bad.  it was a good time at that joint though so 
it was worth it. 

i think that is tomorrow 

Maria-

I just checked it and it worked perfect.  Thanks for your help.

Matt

Oh yeah,

I am supposed to remind you or Eric to find 2 more tickets for next Thursday.

Lisa

did you go  out and party?

let's go party.   we can get a group and go get some food and then hit the 
bars.  tim was supposed to send an email out, but i don't think he has yet.  
i am up for whatever.  

did you and carolyn have a grammy party?   temptation island was dumb.  
everyone went on their dates and hooked up.  next week looks good.

go ahead and take charge.

i am not gettting old, i am getting distinguished.  what is wrong with her 
roomate?

let's hit el tiempo or something

at 730 or 8

you up for woody's tonight?

why would you guys have a party to cheer her up?  that could make you  sick.  
it doesn't matter that i am getting older b/c  i age well.

strep throat is contagious.  you don't need to share a coke to get it.  germs 
travel through the air.  am i really losing my hair?  don't freak me out.

cassie would be fun to hang out with.  i don't know if you want to invite her 
pal though.  i am sure bryan doesnt'

i wish i was that guy from nsync

i know you're kidding.  i have healthy, vibrant, thick, flowing hair.    call 
me later.

The article just discussed on CNNfn.

what is up fellas?  don't worry we will be set up for the big party.  rooms 
and entertainment will be first class.  i need to know when everyone wants to 
go and how much everyone wants to spend.  i was thinking we could get a big 
suite and then we could have the party there.  we can hit vegas in august or 
sept.  let me know what your schedules look like and i will get the ball 
rolling.  

matt  

cool bra!  we will light it up tonight.  call boone dog.

i can't believe merlin has a girlfriend.  last time he had a girlfriend the 
other bush was president.  i will get us something nice.  we can get the 
rainman suite.  i won't let tom take a finders fee.

she blew me up

who all is going for sure:

merlin
peder
ryan
scott
tom
me
max's bro in law
matt battaglia?? ( someone should get in touch with him)
anyone else?

lets just have the party at the royal king motel on colfax and colorado 
blvd.  we will get that hooker scott hooked up with in high school to provide 
the entertainment.   it will be real fun.  

he might be a mole.  no moles.  we can golf, bungee jump or do something wild 
like that.  is that the kind of memorable thing you want to do?  

thanks.  today really sucks so far.  

i'm busy

golf at a good course

what time?  i will be up for some boozing

which el tiempo are we going to tonight?  did gillette send out an email?

Mike Grigsby

Kristian J Lande

01/02/2001 06:15 PM

we can go downtown or uropa or whatever.   just whatever everyone wants to 
do.  what time are we meeting at el tiempo?

no.  go out after you're done at work

how is sept 7-9.  we will arrive the 7th(fri) and leave sunday.  let me know 
if those dates aren't good.

i don't think there is much going on there, but that would be a good time 
also.  could be cheaper.  what does everyone think about the big sleazy?  

how about before that date?

how can we get that girl cassie to go?  do i need to invite her roomate?  
hull could keep her occupied.

lets figure a date and a location.  i know max wants vegas so i think we 
should go there.  if we need to do october that is cool too.

its all good

just drive down richmond and you will see it next to the pink pussycat.  

how much does everyone want to pay?  remember we are picking up max's flight, 
room, and the bachelor party.  thurs-sun sounds good to me.  how does 
everyone feel about that?  merlin- what is the best date for you to go?  

will do.  i will let you guys know monday what we've got.

i thought you said you didn't know where it is.

i am going out tonight

1996.  it had 65k.  $18k.

so what date do you want

9/21-9/23?

let's do the week before.  i think that works better.  actually i will check 
rates on both weekends and if one is cheaper than the other i will take that.

do you want to hit sherlocks around  6-630

no way.  nice.  

	Enron Energy Services
	

The article just discussed on CNNfn.

sounds good

i called her 8 times when i got home last night

i got a room for sept.6th - sept. 9th.  it is the rainman suite at the 
mirage.  there are 2 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, and a huge living room.  with the 
room we get limo service to and from the hotel.  if there are 7 of us paying 
it will cost roughly $225 for each of us.  that is pretty cheap.  this way we 
don't need to get another room.  i also reseved a room at the luxor that can 
sleep 4 and a suite with 1 bedroom and a living room.  this will cost us $200 
per night.  tell me which one you prefer.  we also neet to make sure everyone 
goes b/c if someone drops out it will cost us a lot more.  merlin, the suite 
at the mirage wasn't available for the 13th-16th.  get back to me soon.  you 
can email me back or call me at 713-807-1699.

later

i think i can go in that weekend.  do you want to go fri sat sun or just sat 
sun?

one room is going to have 2 queen size beds and then one will have a king 
size.  there is also couches in the living room and we can get rollaway beds 
to the room.  location is better at the mirage, but the luxor is really nice 
too.  let me know what you guys want today and if the dates are ok.

thanks for the money.  i received it on saturday.  i really needed it.  i 
would definately go to phoenix.  just let me know.

i think we will get better strippers with the shooter room at the mirage.

just give me a call and let me know what this in regards to.    853-7176

daddy got the rainman suite baby

$225 is for 3 nights.  i can cut it down to fri night and sat night and that 
will drop our costs to about 145/night.  if we do that we can golf sat 
morning and then hang by the pool and pick up sluts.  let me know if you guys 
want to drop the trip down to 2 nights.

we are in for 3 nights.  i haven't heard from merlin yet so he is the only 
one who hasn't committed to that weekend.  i also need to check with max.

that is funny shit

thanks for the email.  i can't believe i am 25.  i woke up saturday from a 
hard night of partying  and thought when dad was 25 i was born and now i am 
25 and i still go out and party like an idiot.  oh well, it was fun.  how are 
you feeling?  i hope the dialasys is going well.  let me know.  

love matt

none.  i will check again later b/c i would like to go.

i think we can get this girl for the party.  we will just have to tell her 
that we are big shooters with the rainman suite.

? 
 - salsa1.mpe

is sept 6th-9th good for you?

i think they call her "maddog murdock"

you can see the room we have on www.mirage.com.  go to suites and look at the 
floor plans.  the room we have is the hospitality suite.  it looks like the 
room on the movie "very bad things".    it doesn't show photos.

This will make you have to use the company bathroom.   Ry

i got 6 and bass has 2.  tell him to just go b/c at worst we can get the 
tickets at the dome.  enron might have some floating around.

i went ahead and put a deposit down on the room.  with tax it will be 
$517.75/night.  if we have 7 people paying that will be $222/person.  if 
max's bro in law doesn't go it is about $260/person.  the deposit i put down 
is for one night so if anyone wants to cover some of their costs they can pay 
me.   so IT IS ON now.  sept 6th-sept9th.  i say we get some air brushed 
t-shirts that say "class of '94 - still partyin'".  just tell your 
girlfriends we are going to lake dillon to camp or something. 

here is the list

max
ryan
merlin
scott
peder
tom
me
max's bro in law (possibly)

i think we should pay for max's room and airfare.  i don't know how that 
usually works, but i think we cover that and the entertainment.

go to adcritic.com and go to the john werner bear fight.

sorry i didn't get back to you last night.  i didn't get your message until 
this morning.

Here it is...

Julie  :-)

i did a deal with someone on my desk so there is no brokerage involved.

i didn't go.  i stayed here.  how is work going?  have you been going out at 
all?  i havent seen you since sherlocks.  are you going to def leppard 
tomorrow night?  it is gonna rock.  let me know what is going on for the 
weekend.  i am definately going out on sat night.

you can't shine shit.  whoever drafts him in the second is wasting a pick.  i 
hope it isn't denver.

i can't get off for lunch but we should party before the concert.  we might 
go to tortucas or something to drink before hand.  where are your tickets?  
we are club level.  let me know.

hey lucky fuck.  i just gave you $20 instead of $15 for the $20 you gave me.  
so you still owe me $5.  i can't believe you didn't tell me i was making a 
mistake and stole $5 from me.  i am gonna have to regulate.

it is on thurs night for def leppard.  bass said that there is a tortuca near 
the dome where we can eat and drink some ritas before hand.  i think we 
should meet around 630-7.  let me know by tomorrow so we can figure it out.

i have heard the rodeo opens at 6:45 for rodeo activities, but the concert 
won't start until about 8:30.  someone up here went to duran duran last night 
and it said the same thing on the schedule.  i will call tomorrow and double 
check, but i really don't think they would start a concert that late, def 
leppard isn't that old.

i am glad nobody got back to me on putting in for the deposit.  i will hold 
$500.

yeah and we are going out tonight.  shawn is actually in town.  we should 
meet up.

does everyone want to meet at tortucas on kirby south of 59 or el tiempo(no 
tequilla shots) or cabos downtown tonight.  let's meet around 6-6:30.

i heard you have extra def leppard tickets?  i could use a couple if you have 
extras.  let me know please.

i vote for ruggles at enron field.

can i have it

i  would go into relapse after one shot.  i would probably pass out at 
ruggles.

that is safe

thanks for trying

hoskins has no extra.  i heard it isn't sold out and we can pick one up 
easy.  tell him we are at club level.

ruggles it is.  let's meet there b/t 6-6:30.  i will definately be there at 
6.  i'm not FOOLIN.  i want to party like an ANIMAL.    it is gonna be 
HYSTERIA tonight.  enought of the bad jokes.

here is the forecast.  thanks for taking the time to look over it.  i just 
want to go over production real quick with you.   i will call in about a half 
hour.  

hopefully downtown baby!

Don't fuck with me!  ryan

 - Amazon.doc

that is real nice.  you hate fat people huh?

i will give you a chance to get out when we play again or i will have to 
regulate.  you don't want a shot at the title.

more cushion for the pushin

what the fuck is tome?  bring it old man.  you will be winded by hand 17.

thanks fellas.  i will cover the $510.

last night was so cool.  def leppard rocks.  i am going to a dinner tonight 
but i am going to party tomorrow night.  you?

some broker dinner.  it is just a freebie.

fri was fun.  i went to a broker deal and the wine was unlimited.  we were 
crushing $180 bottles for about 4 hours.  i will take it easy this weekend.  
i have a date with cassie fri, but that is all i will do.

how was dinner last night?

where are we drinking tonight

which question?  i don't know what i am going to do yet?  what do you think?

everyone up here loved that 

i have spoke with her a few times for quite a while.  i would rather go some 
place that is loud and fun like el tiempo.  is there a place like that 
around?

pretty good.  i went to a broker dinner on fri and we ran a mean tab b/c of 
the wine.  what did you do?

i haven't opened it.  i didn't show anyone.  

i want to get some ritas.  maybe i could go to el tiempo if they would let us 
back in.

well i am not going to take her there so i won't worry about that place this 
weekend.  you never said how dinner was last night.

what did you do this weekend?

you didn't think it was funny.

i won at the casino.  it was a profitable trip.  

how much did you hate that brit

did you like his supply bag?  that killed me.

by the time you sent this i was already gone.  maybe we can do it again later 
this week.

daddy bought a big bertha and was stroking it last night

i bought a big bertha and i was stroking it last night straight and deep.  

let me know b/c i want to go back out there. this club goes "bling"  when i 
hit it.

bout $250 with a new viser

i didn't do anything exciting at all this weekend.  i did play rugby on 
saturday.  that was fun.  sat night i went to the hub.  that place is so 
cool.

i love living alone.  it has been great.  i think he like austin.

Mr. Ponce-

I just wanted to get back with you on some of your customers.  Gas in 
California really came off and I just wanted to get the feeling of the

i need to go work out first.  so let's plan for 7.

is telas on sheppard a pretty cool joint to go to on fri?

don juan lenharto

i don't think she has.  they never hung out in high school and just started 
living together in jan.  they were more friendly rather than friends.  
hopefully it will be fun.  she seems really nice.

i don't kiss and tell

just kidding.  we will probably just get drinks.

did you get invited to the wedding?

just thought i would let you fellas know that brooke burke, from E! wild on, 
is posing in playboy next month.  that is all that is keeping me going.

yeah.  you and your friends could just send one drink over after another to 
make me look like a stud.  sounds good.

just break your necks when i walk by to the bathroom or something.  i 
probably won't be able to keep her off of me after that.

give me a call when you get a chance.  i lost your number again.

i can go to vegas either the weekend of the 14th of april or the 21st.  just 
let me know which is the better weekend.

ene sucks

i think tom, robbie and i should still try to get down to phoenix for a 
weekend.  talk to those two and see when a good weekend is for them.  i am 
going to come home in may also for about a week.  

that date sound good to me.  we can stay at the mirage, treasure island, the 
alladin, mgm, ect.  there should be some websites like expedia.com which can 
find hotel rooms easily.  i can arrive thurs evening after probably around 
6.  i will check flights.  it shouldn't be a busy weekend.  i can't wait.  
should be a great weekend.

p love has one.

let's go with dad in april.  you can go with those guys anytime.  plus you 
will probably want to go again after we get back.

i don't know any of the courses, but it should be easy to find one.

what was the name of that chop house restaurant on sheppard?

i can't go in that weekend b/c a good friend of mine is getting married.  we 
could do the following weekend if that is better.

that isn't normal?

maybe we  should try it for lunch when we are hung over.

i changed it

possibly around 3.  i would definately get 9 in

enron's stock has been getting punished.  a lot of my stock options are 
worthless.  it is so dark here right now.  it is going to pour.  i think i am 
going to head to denver for a week in may.  i am not sure which week, but i 
think that would be a good time to go home.  tell martha and billie hello and 
i will try to call you guys this week.

we should probably get tickets tonight.  i will call keneally's today to make 
sure they are selling tickets.  who all is going?

it is like $10/ticket so i am going to need some cash b/c i am not that big 
of a shooter yet.  let me call a little later.

kenneally's sat afternoon.  you in?

who is your new woman?

may sounds better actually.  let's try the first week.

great.

getting married to your sister in law

yeah.  i definately want to play.  if we get out there by 4 we can get nine 
in for sure.

don't quit your job at the handy helper.  i don't think you will make it as a 
comedian with those.

he is in now

i will try to leave at 3.

i say we get there around 2.

hull isn't going to make it.  his grandma passed away.  so you have to wait 
for me.

should we eat before we come over

i met your friend andrea this weekend

i met her at kenneally's on sat.  she was cute.  i am supposed to take her 
out on fri.  

call me at 7138537176

i just heard about it

any time in may is fine.  i think i would go home at the end of may so if you 
want to go at the end of may that could work.  i am checking today to find 
out when grandma and grandpa will come into town.  i will let you know this 
week.

not this weekend but the following weekend.  you missed a great st. patty's 
day.  i have a date with some hot kappa from ut on fri.

started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

i will be out of town

message that he wants to add two people to the party, does anyone know who

we have been playing phone tag.  i will call her today.  i am still planning 
on taking her out tonight.  

i think i told her i have great ankles and beautiful muscle definition in my 
thighs.  where should i go?  i was thinking el tiempo to drink some ritas.

what is lz's?

is that a good place to go for drinks afterwards or should i go somewhere 
else?

did you call me from your car while you were jamming or something?  i heard 
this music going and you were howling.  it is on my voicemail at work.

i shouldn't have erased it.  i heard that dude say your name.

congrats.  i hate my job.

you sounded like a mexican in a marriache (sp?) band.  you were rolling your 
r's.  i was just sitting there thinking "what the fuck?" .  you are a wild 
woman.

that is what i was thinking.

i don't know.  work pays for it.

sorry i didn't call you back on sat.  i had a date that night.

i downloaded some good shit off of napster.  you have got to see my list.

it went well.  i had a real good time.  she likes to party so we got along 
great.

please stop sending these to me.  it is embarrassing.

i got my new cpu and created the greatest rap mix ever.  you definately need 
to copy this one.  how was fishing?

i liked her much better than cassie.  i have 0 interest in cassie.  

cassie is nice, but i have no interest in her.  i am taking this girl out 
again this week before i hit caymen.

no time for lunch dr. jones

why did you guys get all that stuff already?  you still have over a year.  is 
it still going to be in the caymens?  what are you doing for christmas?  i 
mean chuanaka?  

i went to chili's.  i also let her have two drinks there ( i usually tell 
them to drink it slow b/c they are not going to get another).  then we went 
to 7-11, picked up some 40's and hung out in the parking lot.  it was pretty 
cool.

>
>
>

the dude changed my swing completely.  i am going to the range tonight if you 
want to go.

right back at you

is that wierd to break in to women's homes and watch them sleep?  if that is 
wrong i don't want to be right.

nothing is going on here.  i am actually going to grand cayman tomorrow for 
the weekend.  it should be an ok weekend.  did you go out on saturday?  i was 
hurting when i woke up sat morning.

yeah.  a lot more.  i didn't feel like i needed to carry the conversation.  
who is getting married in b.r.?  michelle?

i didn't mean to be snippy.  i am just stressed.  how is everything going?  i 
am going home for a week.  i am looking foward to it.

are all the older people going to ask you why you aren't married yet?

just tell them you don't have a husband you have a "life partner"

how late are you working?  i have a reservation for 8:30.

Big Unit's fastball kills  dove
During the seventh inning of the Diamondbacks'  split-squad 10-6 victory 
against the Giants on Saturday, Randy Johnson hit  and killed a dove flying 
in front of home plate with a fastball. Johnson's  pitch to the Giants' 
Calvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home  plate when it 
struck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked  up the dead bird 
with his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson  before taking it to 
the dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. "I  didn't think it was 
all that funny," he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield 
killed a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The  Ontario police charged 
him with animal cruelty, although the charge was later  dropped.

i have no news, but we are gonna rock.  we have the rainman suite and we will 
have the hottest entertainment up there.  i was at a bachelor party this 
weekend and it was fun, but it won't compare to the one we are gonna throw 
for max.

peder was a virgin.  merlin got more?

let's get him all loaded and send him out on the strip naked.

i already read that shit

is this safe to open

is that it?

i think sept 6-9.  i am coming to denver in either may or july so we will 
iron out the final details then.  i will get the entertainment lined up for 
us.  i am going to vegas in two weeks and i will scout for some other shit to 
do.

i don't think they do that.  you don't want to pay someone to do that shit 
for you.  did your house really burn down?

it was no trouble.  let me know if you need anything else.

party.  i am still dead.  so phoenix was nice?  i had a massage in cayman and 
i thought it was the best thing.  i couldn't figure out why a spa would be a 
good vacation until i had my massage.  give me a call when you get a chance.  
i will be home tonight.

you just sent a reply to all to everyone at enron.

nope

i need to book a jan trip to new orleans.

you guys win one wild card game and all of the sudden the saints are  
superbowl contenders.

no.  you are really on there.

we have improved our defense and our starting qb, who is better than yours, 
was out.  plus we will have two more stud rb's back and some new defensive 
personnel.

are you still partying tonight?  i think i am going to stay in, but i am 
definately up for going out tomorrow night.  

i would love to play the saints.  as i recall we ran right through that great 
defense.

is everyone still up for going out tonight?  i am going to party like a rock 
star tonight.  let's hit downtown.  we don't have to try that place the 
drink.  how about silante's or something.  

  i think you need to do some bartender training tonight.

from indiana jones when the chinese kid says "no time for love dr. jones"

that is gonna be me this weekend

there is an offer to join a golf club called the houston oaks for $145/mo.  
there are 36 holes.  i heard it is a good couse.  it is up near 290 and hwy 
6.  the only thing you pay for is a cart.  sounds like a good deal.  i heard 
it is a nice course.  i am thinking of getting in if anyone else is 
interested.  let me know today what you think.

the website is houstonoaksgolfclub.com.  it doesn't look that great online.  
check it out or ask anyone if they have played there.

this place is like a 45 minute drive so i am out.

A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, "Hey! Wanna hear a
blonde joke?" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
the guy next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, you should know
something."
"The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
is 6'2," weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter." He continues,
"The fella to your right is blond, 6'5" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
joke?"  The blind guy says, "Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
times.

********************

you didn't think that was funny?  do i need to explain that one?

that was great.  that is as funny as i get.

you weren't on there. if you were i am sure you would be a 10.

congrats.  that is good news.  what else is going on.

ditto.  work is it.  i am going to vegas this weekend, so i got that going 
for me.

why not?  you don't like those things?  you get penis straws and everything.

i am going with work.  another boondoggle.

i am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a 
good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned 
good time.  it is a good stress relief.

i am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with 
people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into 
my room.

just b/c i am saving myself doesn't mean you need to attack me.  

i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon"

did you take his v-card?  i don't think i ever dated one.  i like my women 
fast.

why are you staying with her parents?  won't that kill some of your fun?  how 
good was the deal?

got to work dude

oh yeah.  he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.  what 
are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?  if you need entertainment i 
might be for hire.  i would totally give those chicks a thrill.

if i could get a guaranteed contract plus tips i would skip the trip.  
remember how great my legs would look dancing all over the chicks.  

i thought that you said you were sharing a suite with them.  thanks for the 
pics.

i have to hold off until vegas.  my liver is sore from this past weekend.  i 
have to go home and nurse it at night.  

shooters.

are you going out tonight or something?  i think chad has a good opp in 
austin.  now i have somewhere to stay when i go to austin every other 
weekend.  i did have a good date the other night.  i haven't spoke with her 
since so i don't know if i am going out with her or not tonight.

for easter i just stayed in town and golfed all weekend?  what did you do?  
did you go to central and regulate some punks.  what are you doing this 
weekend?  i am going to vegas.  i haven't been home at all this month except 
for last weekend.  i have to go to buttfuck mississippi next weekend for a 
wedding.  

val is getting married there.  his fiance, celeste, is from there.  
mississippi is so cool.

i got your jacket from bass

means you got a lot of ammo

nevermind

i haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not 
on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play?

i don't remember the bet

are you hurting this morning?  my lifestyle has to change within the next 5 
years or i will be dead.

i feel like a champ today

your past few months have been just as bad.  at least i didn't close uropa 
b/c i was puking in the bathroom.

is your dad ok?  what is hines?  is that a development firm?  i just didn't 
call her last night.  you can't call them the next night.  that looks 
pathetic if you do.  this way she can sit around and think about me for a 
day.  she is a cool chick.  nice, cute sorority chick.  well let me know if 
you go out.

i don't remember half of that night, but i do remember you in the bathroom.  
sierra is fun on wednesdays isn't it?

by the way, my abs kill from my rigorous workout yesterday.

who is better for the avs to play?  what has been going on in denver?

should be 7.20.

i hate notre dame.  tim, i need to get down to your office today.

maybe i will come home the 16th of may.  let me see and i will get back to 
you.

i can't come the last week b/c of work.  that is when prices get set for next 
month gas.  it is a very busy week and there is no way for me to get out of 
it.  when are grandma and grandpa coming?

are you on crutches

i don't understand that last email

if it is real estate development i would like to look into it.  let me know.  
i want to see what type of work it is. 

i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i 
think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get 
into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading 
support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope 
that helps you out.

it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't 
know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just 
good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part 
about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it 
especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut up 
nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real 
tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and 
i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to 
live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum 
behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the 
couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty 
freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  
but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of 
pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of 
them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the 
email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our 
boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for 
him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a 
second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the 
guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am 
looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am 
going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.  

MFL

nope.  we talked a couple of times and tenatively planned to go out, but last 
time i called she didn't call back.  she sounded like she has a situation w/ 
her ex or she just might not like me.  that is hard to belive though.

how was mitch's bday?

i didn't get thrown out of a casino.  i had to leave this bar b/c they over 
charged us by $300 so i argued w/ the manager and he said i had to leave.  i 
was pissed, but i didn't get physically removed or anything.  these guys at 
this club tried to rip us off and i was pissed.   i didn't out do my birthday 
either.  we drank a lot but it was over long periods of time.  it wasn't like 
on my birthday when we just slammed everything as fast as we could.  

did you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot 
this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had 
fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it 
as an indication.

did you get a stripper?  

that is nasty

i got a few of them.  i have a rash now in my lap.

you should see the rash

ho w have you been?  i haven't been up to much just going out and stuff.  are 
you going home for the holidays?  i am heading to denver this weekend and 
will be there through next week.  what are you doing over new years?

it isn't oozing, just itching.  it was worth every penny.  i think this 
hooker really liked me.

thanks.  i heard boone was in rare form though.  i am dead tired right now.

i have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that 
but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock.

i don't know but i don't want to make it.  i just want to stay home.

Have him send his resume to Karen Buckley in HR.  There is a new round of 
trading track interviews in May.

tim should have it.  so are you getting nervous.  vegas rocked.  what time 
does the wedding start and how long of a drive is it?  i bet you're nervous.  
let me know if we need to keep  a car running out front.

 THE GOLFING NUN
A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.
"I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible
about it."
"When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.
"Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was
going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging
over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
about 10 yards."

"Is that when you swore?"
"No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a squirrel ran out of the
bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away."

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.
"Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an
eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and
began to fly away!"

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.

"No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it
flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."

"Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
"No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."

The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands
said, "You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?"

Fellas, Check out "Charley's" ride! You gotta watch him  with both eyes. 
Before you know it you'll be pull'n a 66 Chevy.

i am going to try to rent out my place and get another hopefully.  

did you like the blond with the white sweater?

shawn is in town tonight and wants to get a bite to eat if you are up for it.

i will let you know.  i need to run after work.

email me back or just give me a call tonight.

what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this 
weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing 
shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty 
discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was 
dc?  i heard that place is a blast.

i heard dc is fun.  i don't care what we do.  we were talking about going to 
boone's sat and hang out on his porch and drink before we go out.  i think he 
has a patio in his backyard.

what is it.  i got to know.  i need some new chicks.  i need the weekend.  
today totally sucks.  what are some good books to read?

ok?  

i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next 
morning when you both woke up.

this is for mom

i just want some clothes from polo.  or some colonge from polo - called polo 
sport.  what do you want?

i bought my ticket.  i arrive on that saturday @ 12:20pm.  i will email 
grandma.

hey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks 
today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to 
seeing everyone.

love matt

what is grandma's email address?

i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th 
at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  
i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf 
swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for 
picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.

love matt

i hope this isn't a pic of a naked old man again.  what has been going on?  i 
haven't heard from you in a while.

you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in 
mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends 
ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star 
that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something 
this week.  

did they look good or lucky to win?  how is roy playing?

you said the line worked well and when i first started reading that i was 
like "hey now!".  you never know.  you could be a wild woman on vacation if 
you never have to see those people again.

why would you shoot yourself?  chicks go home with guys all the time.

how long do you have your lease at midtown?

how was your wedding?

i went to val's wedding.  it was a blast.  how did a wedding get busted by 
the cops?  what type of people went to this thing?

next week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or 
something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to 
waste a saturday moving.  

this is still my email.  what is going on?  how is your business doing?  

i think i met a few of your friends that night, but i don't remember who is 
who.  it seems like such a long time ago. any time is good for me next week.  
let's get together on tuesday?  let me know if that is good for you. 

nice.  i knew that would be a better choice.  saturday night is on dog.  we 
are going to golf sat also if you are in.  let me know.  tee time is at 11.

that was a mistake.  i don't know what i was thinking.  i need to stay home.

i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  
the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best 
thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing 
lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of 
struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will 
try to call you and grandma this weekend.  

matt

you staying warm up there?  looks like the wind chill is sub 30.  what do you 
and billie have planned for the holidays?  i am heading home on friday.  i am 
looking foward to getting home.  hopefully the weather wont be too cold.  
well i just wanted to say hello.  talk to you soon.

matt

he went home already.  we went to dinner mon & tues.  i am just going to 
chill this week and party on saturday, maybe even friday a little.  are you 
going out tomorrow?

enron would probably do something like this, but i think you need to contact 
that charity group.  they might already have a team.  it is good to see that 
you are such a philanthropist.  

you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee?

i have a tee time for sat @ 11.  let me know if you think you can play 
today.  the course is sienna plantation.

saturday is definately on.  fri i am up for whatever.  maybe happy hour and 
turn in before 2am for once.  

Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

"I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself.
"He has the perfect arm!"
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is "canonized"
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
"Mom," he says into the phone,
"I just won the Super Bowl."
"I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says.
"You deserted us.  You are not my son."
"I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads.
"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans."
"No, let me tell you," the mother retorts.
"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says "
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans."

he is a winner.  kansas might turn into a 6 win a year program with cooper 
there.

yeah.  i think they will go to the rose bowl.

look for some gifts i sent home for lori, mckenna and grandma.  they should 
get there before friday.  if not let me know.  i got mckenna something from 
etoys and i heard they are having some problems.  their stock dropped to 
$0.28 yesterday from $82 last year so i don't know if they even care 
anymore.  see you this weekend.

the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot.

rohan davey

you better be able to golf tomorrow.  

you obviously haven't seen my new swing.  you need to be on your best game to 
take my title.

totally 

i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating 
them up after you threw up for 2 hours

all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at 
front porch also SUSAN!

especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter

susan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.  

susan said:
why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who 
came back to the table with puke on myself.  

tell grandma i can't wait to hear her sing.

what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say " i am a trader at enron"

tomorrow?

this is their last hope

how was happy hour?  i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the 
message until late.

if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team

they have to be worried about you in ebs if you come in to work hung over on 
mondays

it is a good work out for you to move up 3 flights of stairs.  did you move 
it all yourself or pay someone to do it?   mi luna is good for me tomorrow.

meet you there if you are going straight from work.

have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet?   i heard the comfort suites is 
where everyone is staying.  let me know if you guys just want to load 
everyone up in one room like back in high school.

comfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down 
there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only 
condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself.

i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store 
around the corner from my house.

that actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7.  
that is the place in the village correct?

that is right.  i was looking at our operations group numbers which are 
incorrect.

i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each.  jen knows the 
details, but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week.  

7:30 is good.

let me know what is up after you speak with her

did you call my cell last night?

he is a mo

i don't have it, but shoot him an email and he will give you a call.

i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites.  
it would be $200/each for the whole week if 4 were in a room.  a condo would 
most likely be more expensive.

jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party.  

we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.16.

hell yeah dog!  they betta be ready to get up on deez nuts.

> 1. Cleveland Steamer: an act in which one partner hovers above the

>
> 3. Rusty Trombone: the process by which one person is tossing a guy's

> 4. Dirty Sanchez: while fucking a girl doggy style, insert a finger in

>
> 5. Slimy Snatchita: it's basically the same concept as the Dirty

>
> 6. Dirty Schultz: same as Dirty Sanchez, except you give yourself the
> shitstache.
>
> 7. Dog In a Bathtub: when a man attempts to insert his nuts into a girls

> bathtub.
>
> 8. Samoan Pile Driver: a sexual position that occurs when a woman's

> 16. Fanny Batter: in Britain they call a woman's vagina  the FANNY and

> 17. Brushback Pitch: when you're getting head, yell "Batter Up!" Then,

		Broncos Topper
		 McGlockton defends himself
		
		
		brn0507csm
		McGlockton (J. Leyba)
		 Weighing in at 352 pounds, Chester McGlockton is the heaviest starting 
defensive lineman in Denver Broncos history. He also has become a mighty big 
target. 
		
		Last month, former San Diego Chargers director of player personnel Billy 
Devaney, working for ESPN as an NFL draft analyst, applauded each of the 
Broncos' offseason moves - except one. Devaney blasted the Broncos for 
signing McGlockton, whom he candidly accused of being a negative locker room 
influence. About which McGlockton shrugs.

		Jackson (AP)
		 He misses family members, friends, food and the fun. Yet these days, 
Barcelona Dragons quarterback Jarious Jackson - on loan from the Denver 
Broncos - misses out on nothing. 
		
		Jackson's Barcelona, Spain, hotel is positioned along a topless beach. He 
swims in Europe's history and traditions. He travels as if he were a college 
backpacker, visiting Berlin last month, Dusseldorf, Germany, last weekend, 
with plans that still include Amsterdam and Scotland.

Donnie -

Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -
Val

            "Trahan, Don"
Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.

Donnie

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and

the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

i heard dc is fun.  i don't care what we do.  we were talking about going to boone's sat and hang out on his porch and drink before we go out.  i think he has a patio in his backyard.

greatest email ever

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:

Texas Fight at

11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like

11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

we are going in saturday.  thanksgiving was great.  i played golf all weekend.  how was yours.  i really appreciate you sending that resume on.  did you get this reply earlier?  my cpu keeps blowing up.

i think so, but i haven't made definite plans yet.  are you? 
i called my brother in law and he said he'd talk to someone to see what's out there. 
i'll let you know if i hear anything. 
did you have a good thanksgiving? 

what is it.  i got to know.  i need some new chicks.  i need the weekend.  today totally sucks.  what are some good books to read?

no, but i saw that they won tonight.  it was close.  is sakic going to be ok?  

i thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next morning when you both woke up.

ditto.  work is it.  i am going to vegas this weekend, so i got that going for me.

i bought my ticket.  i arrive on that saturday @ 12:20pm.  i will email grandma.

hey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.

love matt

what is grandma's email address?

i just ordered my ticket about 5 minutes ago.  i arrive in fargo on the 9th at 12:20 pm.  the ticket was $430.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.  i think it will be fun.  i am going to bring my clubs.  i have a new golf swing after a lesson i took a few weeks ago.  hope all is well.  thanks for picking up the bill for my ticket.  i really appreciate it.

love matt

i hope this isn't a pic of a naked old man again.  what has been going on?  i haven't heard from you in a while.

you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something this week.  

did they look good or lucky to win?  how is roy playing?

you said the line worked well and when i first started reading that i was like "hey now!".  you never know.  you could be a wild woman on vacation if you never have to see those people again.

why would you shoot yourself?  chicks go home with guys all the time.

that is good

why not?  you don't like those things?  you get penis straws and everything.

how was your wedding?

i went to val's wedding.  it was a blast.  how did a wedding get busted by the cops?  what type of people went to this thing?

next week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to waste a saturday moving.  

this is still my email.  what is going on?  how is your business doing?  

i think i met a few of your friends that night, but i don't remember who is who.  it seems like such a long time ago. any time is good for me next week.  let's get together on tuesday?  let me know if that is good for you. 

nice.  i knew that would be a better choice.  saturday night is on dog.  we are going to golf sat also if you are in.  let me know.  tee time is at 11.

745 sucks.  we will hit it sat night.

that was a mistake.  i don't know what i was thinking.  i need to stay home.

i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will try to call you and grandma this weekend.  

matt

i am going with work.  another boondoggle.

he went home already.  we went to dinner mon & tues.  i am just going to chill this week and party on saturday, maybe even friday a little.  are you going out tomorrow?

enron would probably do something like this, but i think you need to contact that charity group.  they might already have a team.  it is good to see that you are such a philanthropist.  

you going to golf or go play ultimate dork frisbee?

i have a tee time for sat @ 11.  let me know if you think you can play today.  the course is sienna plantation.

saturday is definately on.  fri i am up for whatever.  maybe happy hour and turn in before 2am for once.  

Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

"I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself.
"He has the perfect arm!"
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is "canonized"
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
"Mom," he says into the phone,
"I just won the Super Bowl."
"I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says.
"You deserted us.  You are not my son."
"I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads.
"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans."
"No, let me tell you," the mother retorts.
"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says "
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans."

he is a winner.  kansas might turn into a 6 win a year program with cooper there.

yeah.  i think they will go to the rose bowl.

i am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned good time.  it is a good stress relief.

the joke reminds everyone of suzy b/c she drinks a lot.

rohan davey

you better be able to golf tomorrow.  

you obviously haven't seen my new swing.  you need to be on your best game to take my title.

totally 

nope

i bet your teeth are on strike too b/c all the bile in your stomach is eating them up after you threw up for 2 hours

all i know is we can never go back to teala's.  i don't want to get banned at front porch also SUSAN!

especially since boone bought some weed from the waiter

susan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.  

susan said:
why the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself.  

i am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room.

what about when he was gargaling puke trying to say " i am a trader at enron"

i think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night.  we will know for next weekend.

what is up with the avs?  are they going to shit their pants again?

how was moving this weekend?  did you still want to get a drink after work tomorrow?

this is their last hope

how was happy hour?  i was golfing when you called and i didn't get the message until late.

if they don't win i read that they are going to break up the team

they have to be worried about you in ebs if you come in to work hung over on mondays

it is a good work out for you to move up 3 flights of stairs.  did you move it all yourself or pay someone to do it?   mi luna is good for me tomorrow.  i love their ritas.  how about we go around 7.  i can pick you up or just meet you there if you are going straight from work.  

just b/c i am saving myself doesn't mean you need to attack me.  

6:30 is fine with me.  i will meet you at the bar.

have you guys reserved a room for caymen yet?   i heard the comfort suites is where everyone is staying.  let me know if you guys just want to load everyone up in one room like back in high school.

comfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself.

i think they sell tickets for that dude's concert at the hollywood food store around the corner from my house.

that actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7.  that is the place in the village correct?

i heard your nickname in highschool was the "virgin surgeon"

i think they have two rooms with two double beds in each.  jen knows the details, but i heard we need to make reservations within the next week.  

7:30 is good.

let me know what is up after you speak with her

did you call my cell last night?

he is a mo

i don't have it, but shoot him an email and he will give you a call.

i spoke with him this weekend and the place he mentioned was comfort suites.  it would be $200/each for the whole week if 4 were in a room.  a condo would most likely be more expensive.

jen has a lot of cougar friends who will be ready to party.  

we sold this gas for these volumes to ees for index +0.16.

Donnie -

Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -
Val

            "Trahan, Don"

Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.

Donnie

why are you staying with her parents?  won't that kill some of your fun?  how good was the deal?

you partied it up at jazz fest?  i still have never been.  who did you go there with?  

yeah i will be in town this weekend.  i have something to go to fri but i will definately be out on saturday.  what are you doing?

i think she is one of jen's cougar friends.  that is such a chick thing to do.  

read the bottom of the email with some chicks idea as a gift

i am sure that girl courtney walker would like to share some special memories also

sure.  you buy something and let me know how much i owe

so i got us a hotel room in caymen.  it can sleep up to six and it is $880 for the three nights.  if all 5 of us stay there that is 176/ea.  we have it for thurs-sat night.  

jen's dad better buy a bunch of booze.  and the schrutt's better take us somewhere nice for the rehersal dinner.  and jen's friends better put out.

what is the date of the party

i tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look?  st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time.

i like this one...

oh yeah.  he doesn't sound like a lot of fun - if you catch my drift.  what are you guys doing for the bachelorette party?  if you need entertainment i might be for hire.  i would totally give those chicks a thrill.

what  time is golf for?

does anyone have a picture of max when he used to walk around and flex his pecs?

i will be there 

that does sound gay

season over

i am ready to take some more of your money out there

he is there best player

oops

if i could get a guaranteed contract plus tips i would skip the trip.  remember how great my legs would look dancing all over the chicks.

Derek-

Here is the notice that was sent out by PG&E on Friday.  This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. 
Due to high inventory on the PG&E system, any new nominations placed in the
Intraday 1 cycle will be cut to zero for gas day 05/11/2001.  System
constraints will be held to Evening scheduled volumes.

If you have any questions, please call the Gas Scheduling Hotline at (415)
973-2424 or the CGT Helpline at 1 (800) 343-4743 and then press 2 for
scheduling assistance.

CGT Schedulers
PG&E - California Gas Transmission

we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. 
	Matt

	I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

	Thanks

i thought that was your area code.  kind of freaked me out.  you can be a little crazy sometimes.  just kidding.  don't mess with texas is good.  it is about to get really hot here.  we reserved a room at comfort suites.  i think that is where everyone is staying in the caymens?  i am looking foward to it.  should be a blast.  when is the bachelorette party?  what are you guys going to do?  

My area code is 954....I'm not your stalker....How's Don't Mess with
Texas?....what's up for your summer?
someone was calling for me at work yesterday and they got my friends
extension. he said the area code on the phone number was 972. so what has

i just looked at the prices for flights to cayman and they run around $600.  this is going to cost over $1000.  start saving now.

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a
doughnut to complete the circle.  Has anyone fwded that mail to Coco?  I'm
sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

together. what did you do last weekend? you're going to kill me, but i am
most likely leaving for chicago (for work) on thurs.....what are your plans
for the weekend? we can get together next week?

nothing is going on here.  how was the wedding this weekend?  i am still
trying to rest up from the weekend.  are we going out thurs or are you
going to bag me?

i think miami would be more fun than cayman.  cayman is really laid back.  miami = hot sluts

Really?  I could definetely handle the South  Beach.

i don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said.  i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not.  don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it.  i think miami would be a lot more fun.

Are you being serious Lenhart?  They need to make up their minds, QUICK.  Go

Here it is...

 

Julie  :-)

she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each.    miami will rock.  

are you still talking to your new years romance? who is this friend that
you're getting the info from?

does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either place will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.

I'd rather go to the caymans personally.  Miami sucks.

i just want to meet some models down there.  i don't hang out at discos thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.  i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis.

nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be at a
resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque dance
clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay back in
the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.

They have finally been released!  For those not familiar with the Darwin
Award, it's an annual honor given to the person who provided the
universal human gene pool the biggest service by getting killed in the
most extraordinarily stupid way.  As always, competition this year has
been keen again.  Some candidates appear to have trained their whole
lives for this event!

THE RUNNER-UPS

1.  Detroit - A 41-year-old man got stuck and drowned in two feet of
water after squeezing head first through an 18-inch wide sewer grate to
retrieve his car keys.

2.  San Francisco - A 49-year-old stockbroker, who "totally zoned when
he ran" according to his wife, jogged off a 100-foot high cliff on his
daily run.

3.  Buston, NC - a man died on a beach when an 8-foot-deep hole he had
dug into the sand caved in as he sat inside it.  Beachgoers said Daniel
Jones, 21, dug the hole for fun or for protection from the wind, and had
been sitting in a beach chair at the bottom when it collapsed, burying
him beneath 5 feet of sand.   People used their hands and shovels,
trying to claw their way to Jones, a resident of Woodbridge, VA, but
could not reach him.  It took rescue workers using heavy equipment
almost an hour to free him while about 200 people looked on.  Jones was
pronounced dead at the hospital.

4.  Lompoc, CA - Santiago Alvarado, 24 was killed as he fell face-first
through the ceiling of a bicycle shop he was burglarizing.  Death was
caused when the long flashlight he had placed in his mouth rammed into
the base of his skull as he hit the floor.

5.  Dahlonega, GA - ROTC cadet Nick Berrena, 20, was stabbed to death by
fellow cadet Jeffrey Hoffman, 23, who was trying to prove that a knife
could not penetrate the flack vest Berrena was wearing.

6.  Selbyville, DE - Sylvester Briddell, Jr., 26 was killed as he won a
bet with friends who said he would not put a revolver loaded with four
bullets into his mouth and pull the trigger.

7.  Windsor, Ontario - Daniel Kolta, 27, and Randy Taylor, 33, died in a
head-on collision, thus earning a tie in the game of chicken they were
playing with their snowmobiles.

8.  Taos, NM - A woman went to a poison control center after eating
three birth-control vaginal inserts.  Marie Valishnokov (who spoke
little English) thought the inserts were candy or gum, being unable to
read the foil wrappers. After the third one, she realized something was
wrong with her throat and her mouth began to fill with a sour-tasting
foam.  She ran for the Poison Control Center where doctors were able to
flush the foam from her mouth, throat and stomach with no ill effects.

9.  La Grange, GA - Attorney Antonio Mendoza was released from a trauma
center after having a cell phone removed from his rectum.  "My dog drags
the thing all over the house," he said later.  "He must have dragged it
into the shower.  I slipped on the tile, tripped against the dog and sat
down right on the thing." The extraction took more than three hours
because the cover to Mendoza's phone had opened during insertion.  "He
was a real trooper during the entire episode," said Dr. Dennis Crobe.
"Tony just
cracked jokes and really seemed to be enjoying himself.  Three times
during the extraction his phone rang and each time, he made jokes about
it that just had us rolling on the floor.  By the time we finished, we
really did expect to find an answering machine in there."

10. Bremerton, WA - Christopher Coulter and his wife Emily were engaging
in bondage games when Christopher suggested spreading peanut butter on
his genitals and letting Rudy, their Irish Setter, lick them clean.
Sadly, Rudy lost control and began tearing at Christopher's penis and
testicles. Rudy refused to obey commands and a panicked Emily threw a
bottle of perfume at the dog.  The bottle broke, covering the dog and
Christopher with perfume. Rudy leaped back, tearing away the penis.
While trying to get her unconscious husband in the car to take him to
the hospital, Emily fell twice, injuring her wrists and ankle.
Christopher's penis was put in a Styrofoam ice cooler.  "Chris is just
plain lucky," said the surgeon who spent eight hours reattaching the
penis.  "Believe it or not, the perfume turned out to be very
fortuitous.  The high alcohol content, which must have been
excruciatingly painful, helped sterilize the wound.  Also, aside from it
being removed, the damage caused by the dog's teeth to the penis per se
is minimal.  It's really a very stringy piece of flesh.  Mr. Coulter
stands an excellent chance of regaining the use of that limb."
Washington Animal Control has no plans to seize Rudy.

AND THE WINNER

Paderborn, Germany - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his
constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a
bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm
finally let fly and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop.
Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich, 46, was attempting to give the
ailing elephant an olive-oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on
him like a dumptruck full of mud.  "The sheer force of the elephant's
unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he
struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued
to evacuate his bowels on top of him.

sure.  we can probably get out there and play at 3.

Let me know if we will need a 4th person to play on Friday afternoon. A guy
I work with may be able to fill in if no one else can join us.

do you think the avs will close out the blues tonight?  they haven't looked too good the last two games.

i am not that picky.  she is nice it just didn't work out well.  we had fun  it just hasnt took off.  one of those deals.  

Not a lot.  I have been on a few dates, but haven't been out with the same
guy more than 3 times.  Guess I'm being too picky.  But I know I'm not as
picky as you....I don't look at the ankles.  just kidding.
so what was wrong with this girl?

i am not dating her.  i only went out with her a few times.  i doubt we

Matt Lenhart

let me check with him and see what night would be good for him to go up.  we are golfing on fri so sat might be a better time to get up there.  i will let you know.  

could be a good weekend for you and Mitch to make a trip.  I am not going to Florida.

CKL

did you get chad's email?  i would rather go up next weekend.  i will go up this weekend if you are up for it, but if not i think we need a good excuse.

Let me know if we will need a 4th person to play on Friday afternoon. A guy
I work with may be able to fill in if no one else can join us.

did you see the article in the journal where cali's attorney general said he wants to lock up ken lay (ene's chairman) in a prison cell with a cell mate?

next sat might be better.  i don't think mitch is gonna be able to make it and everyone was out of town last weekend.  let's do it next sat if you are in town.

a trip up here for M-day.  We could hit 4th street Saturday Night.  Let me know.

CKL

i told him i didn't think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat.

Next weekend would be better for me. I was looking forward to stretching
this weekend out as much as possible... and not being in a car for 6 hours.

Boone will be pissed if we take off. He wants to booze on Saturday and
Sunday.

Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel

the product number for pg&e topock is 47085.   the correct company name for transcanada is the division of transcanada.  thanks for your help.

matt

I need the following information requested by the customer access group (see e-mail below). I also need to know if your current product numbers and when you want to transfer them over to the "Restricted" Product types.  Please let me know as soon as you can.

Thanks,

Melba,

I have made all of the changes with the exception of adding the following:

Aquila Risk Management Corp - Not approved for Physical trading
PG&E Core - Not EOL counterparty
TransCanada Gas Service - need clarification TransCanada Gas Services Inc. or TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Would you like me to follow up with Matt on the TransCanada issue.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Stephanie,

I have compared the lists and this is what I found:

 << File: Restricted Customer List.xls >> 
This is what you sent me.

This is Matt's list.

Let me know if I can help you at all with anything you need.  

Thank you,

was she on your left when you were running?

the sitara deal looks correct

Please verify price for Client Services.

Elizabeth,
For Jan 20-22, 2001, PG&E paid a fixed price of $10.50/mmbtu for an ENA gas sale on SITARA #576162.
We show the price should be fixed at $12.35/mmbtu.  The difference amounts to a $22,338.75 underpayment.
Please advise.

i have a type and she fits it.  you obviously didn't know who she was.  so is your boss going to make you take out her son?

what, did you not mean to cc: me on that?  

anyway, about the girl.  i dont know why i dont think she is your type.  the more i think about it the more i notice that you really dont have a type - so who knows.  the game was good, we lost 6-2.  4 of the padres runs were homeruns. we suck.

As we all know, Blanchard was a GDI his first semester at LSU.  While livin=
g in Power dorm, Blanchard once overheard one of the Pi PHi for boys that h=
e was hanging out with say "Hey, Dude, Sorority girls are hot!"  Blanchard,=
 being from Paincourteville and not being what we would call a 'master' of =
the English language, though that this 'fresh' Pi Phi meant "All greek girl=
s are good in bed."  So what did Blanchard do.  He went out and found the f=
irst GREEK girl he could, and he started dating her.  After many pleasant y=
ears, (some of which I will not mention for Tim's sake, and mine)  Tim and =
his Greek Goddess are engaged.  Yes, that's right.  Tim took Lenhart's advi=
ce (because we all know that Lenhart is the authority on relationships with=
 the opposite sex; I mean, who wouldn't take his advice) and Tim decided to=
 start his life sentence with a lovely girl who has bunch of friends who al=
l give it up like it was going out o! f style. =20
=20
Tim's wedding is on THE DAY OF THE MISSISSIPPI STATE GAME.  For those of yo=
u who are not Tiger fans (which seems to be most of you these days), that i=
s Oct. 20th.  I know, it is an away game, which is better than having a wed=
ding on a home game.  But some of us who are fans like to go to the out of =
town games.  True story, here.  I went to a wedding with Louise and her mot=
her on Friday night.  You have not lived until you take two dates to a wedd=
ing, one of whom is engaged to your good friend and the other whom cannot s=
peak the language.  Anyway, after the wedding that we attended, Louise's mo=
m asked me if I would prefer Tim's wedding ceremony be in either half Engli=
sh and half Greek, or all in Greek.  I responded "I do not care.  I will be=
 listening to the LSU game on my headphones anyway."  I know what some of y=
ou are saying, it is only one game.  Yes, and I am sure that was the only w=
eekend they could hav! e it since so many of us from New Orleans have been =
to a wedding at the Greek Cultural Center, because all of us from New Orlea=
ns have been to numerous weddings / goat roasts there.  Anyway, it is a don=
e deal, and we are all happy for the couple.
=20
The real point of this e-mail is to organize Tim's bachelor party.  We have=
 it planned for the weekend of September 22 (what a novel idea!!!  Plan a w=
edding event on a weekend where there is neither an LSU event, nor Jazz Fes=
t!!!)  We are planning to go to Vegas.  As per our current plans, we would =
leave on that Thursday (the 20th, I think) and return on Sunday.  'Paw Paw'=
 Blanchard heard that in September, his game of choice really starts hittin=
g, that of course would be the nickel slots.  'Paw Paw' already has his Pan=
ama Jack hat, his         "Geaux Dinar-deaux" T-shirt, his jams, and his bl=
ack socks with brown leather sandals packed and ready.  His fanny pack is s=
tuffed with Twinkies and silver dimes.  He is really fired up about the $1.=
99 shrimp cocktail (early bird special, of course.)
The plans are to get there Thursday night (Nicky, get more drink tickets.) =
 Thursday night we can get settled, possibly gamble a bit.  On Friday, mayb=
e play golf (although I will probably be too drunk / hung over / missing fo=
r an early tee time.)  On Friday night, we can go "clubbin'", as I am sure =
The Tricky Texas Trio (Lenhart, Landry, and Mitch) will want to do.  On Sat=
urday, Tim wants to wake up early, get the sports section of the Advocate, =
drink coffee, and bitch about the Tigers.  Instead, we are going to watch a=
nd bet on College Football all day.
Saturday night, Tim wants to go see Sigfried and Roy.  However, we are not =
doing that.  If he wants to see gay men play with caged tigers, he can find=
 out the next time Nesbitt tries out for the LSU cheerleading team.  Instea=
d, either SaturDay or Friday night, myself and a select group (yet to be de=
termined, but including Lenhart if he is not doing his best Ricky Martin im=
pression at Club C2K) will go on a recon mission to the Deja Vu.  Therefore=
, on Saturday night, we will have entertainment in the room that some of us=
 have seen before, and who know what is expected of them (that way Lenhart =
will not make the entertainment  cry when he asks them to fuck his Elway bl=
ow-up doll).  Remember Tim.  If you use a strap on, it is not considered ch=
eating.  I am a future lawyer.  I should know.
This weekend is September 22.  There is no excuse for you to come up with w=
hen you have this much notice.  Out of money?  Bullshit.  Save up until the=
n.  Have to work?  Bullshit.  Take a vacation day.  Actually, September wil=
l be the first month that I will be gainfully employed.  But, I know that m=
y boss, the Honorable G.Thomas Porteous, will let me off for one day if deb=
auchery will be had, although I may have to put a few hundreds on black for=
 him periodically throughout the weekend.
For those of you who will be recently married, I already have an excuse for=
 you.  "Honey, Tim came to all OUR wedding functions.  The least I can do i=
s return the favor."
For those of you that will be married shortly after Tim, I also have an exc=
use. "Baby / Schmoopy / I wish your tits were as big as Mindy/, if want oth=
er people to come to our wedding functions, then I have to attend theirs." =
 For all of you single guys, no excuse.
Please respond to this e-mail at your earliest convenience, or I will see y=
a'll this weekend.  All plans are subject to change.  (Chad, if you want to=
 send an e-mail to only me, hit 'Reply to sender.'  If you hit 'Reply to al=
l'. it sends the message to all of the RECEPIENTS of the original message. =
 I know that you said Law School was such a stupid idea compared to Busines=

is better to remain silent and be thought of as a fool than to open your mo=
uth and remove all doubt.)

 $7.50 per night. She gets
 $234 a month welfare for each child. If her $325 per
 month rent goes up 15%,
 how many more children should she have to keep up
 with her expenses?

10. Salvador was arrested for dealing crack and his
 bail was set at $25,000.
 If he pays a bail bondsman 12% and returns to
 Mexico, how much money will he
 lose by jumping bail?

yeah i know, but admit you laughed.  

that is so mean!!

 

do you want to send your resume to enron again?  they are on a big kick to hire some new people.  might be worth your while just to take a look and  see how it compares.

Are we walking or riding?

i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night?

Matt,

 i told susan that mitch and chad stayed over but didnt mention anything about her room or chad throwing up.  so remember that in your conversations with her.

i will invite you to be my caddie.  you can carry my clubs and clean them for me.  if you do a good job i will give you a crisp $5 bill.

nothing. we did go get a pizza and then i passed out.  apparently i was more drunk then i thought. so funny story about me at the driving range yesterday...  i launched the 7 iron about 20-30 yds out onto the green. do you still think you might invite me to play a round with you some time?

i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night?

Matt,

i guess i am going up there saturday.  i think i will try to take it easy on friday.  i can  definately tell that i am not 18 anymore b/c i cannot recover at all. i am also going broke going out.

so are you heading to austin this weekend with shawn? i am ridiculous... i am already trying to make plans for the weekend. how is the roommate situation?

so what did you and lisa do until 7am loverboy?

Next weekend would be better for me. I was looking forward to stretching
this weekend out as much as possible... and not being in a car for 6 hours.

Boone will be pissed if we take off. He wants to booze on Saturday and
Sunday.

Where do you think we'll have the most fun? That's what's really important.
If you think Austin will be more fun, then maybe we should go.

Thanks,

nevermind

sorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon.

Monday was a complete wash.  I got there at 12:00 and only 2 others were there.  When I talked to you and you said you were on your way, we hung up and my phone died.  I tried to remember any number I could to try and get a hold of you, but I always use speed dial and don't know any numbers.  Boone has a private number.  I got your message on my voice mail at 12:30, but you didn't leave a number.  I think I know where you guys went wrong with the directions.  I bet you went south on JFK instead of north.  The first light you come to on the north side is Greens.  Then you take a right and it's a 1/4 mile on the right.  We will plan another outing, but at a course you know how to get to.

By the way, I shot a 92.  I was so hung over I was sweating scotch.  I did drive a par 4.  Was about 340 yards (missed the eagle, got the par).

  so did a video come up? 

i remember you.  i was pretty drunk though.  hopefully i didn't make too much of an ass out of myself.  we hit it really hard that night for my buddy's birthday.  how was your bachelorette party?  are you back in austin now?

hi matt....

Thanks for asking.   Face is fine now.  Graduated today and nobody really noticed.  Did have to use a little make up though.

my friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street.  

stop making excuses- your friends all said that you're
always very drunk every weekend. ha.
i'm back in austin.  i did have fun sat.night- it was
worth driving in for:)
i'm about a quart low today; i drove back on sunday &
spent the rest of the weekend on the lake.  i need to
go home.
why are you coming up this weekend again?  for some
reason, i can't remember.

i will be in nd.  i think my plane lands 10 min. after yours.  avs got worked last night.  i don't have a good feeling about the series now.  they had no answer for the defense.  

I am going to work on site at a conversion building. It should be a good pay
increase and I will get a ton of experience. I only have to work 11-6. I'll
have to work weekends but have a couple of days off during the week. I have
to work the Bronco games this year, Damon said he had to work them last year
on another project so it is my turn. I'll just bring a little TV in to
watch. It should be pretty cool. Are you going to N. Dakota in a couple of
weeks?

i am excited to watch it.  so you got a promotion at work?  that is good
news.  what is your new job going to be?

i think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on.  i need the  range.  just send your resume when you get a chance.  enron is looking for a ton of people.

I got in late and I forgot to send that stuff. I'll send it to you tonight.
You need to let me know what they are looking for.

Are you going to the range this week? I can maybe go tomorrow afternoon
@7:00p

Thanks,

i haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play?

i just don't know if they can ever handle that defense.  they didn't make any good adjustments in the 3rd period.

I don't think the Avs are done. They looked shitty last night, as soon as
the Devils got that 2nd goal they played the trap defense. The Avs could
barely handle the puck all night. If they were at the top of their game they
could have scored at least one more goal against that defense. We'll see.

i will be in nd.  i think my plane lands 10 min. after yours.  avs got
worked last night.  i don't have a good feeling about the series now.  they
had no answer for the defense.

   I am going to work on site at a conversion building. It should be a good

   increase and I will get a ton of experience. I only have to work 11-6.
   I'll
   have to work weekends but have a couple of days off during the week. I
   have

      They looked unbeatable. The Devils looked like shit but if the Avs
   play
      like
      that, there is no way they will be beat. Tonight will be a big game.

i forgot you had a wedding.  i don't go up to austin all that much.  i usually stay down here and go out.  where do you work up there again?  i am sure you told me, but i forgot.  where are the good places to hang out?  is it 4th st?

i was kidding about your friends...besides- i
definately do not have room to talk.
i guess you didn't remember, i have a "wedding" on
saturday?  i have to be in h-town on fri. for the
rehearsal.  sucks. you'll have fun though- do you come
to austin a lot?  next time i'm in houston will
probably be father's day.

i've had just about enough of this place for one day,
so i'm going home now...
have a good day

you think houston is the armpit of the world?  i love it hear.  the weather sucks in the summer, but other than that it is a blast.  so you do work for strip clubs huh?  that is interesting.  what is your stripper name?

hey there- how's it goin?

4th st. is sort-of away from all the college
crowd...it's pretty cool, i like it.  if you were to go
to 6th. 'the library' & 'the aquarium' are good
places. 'touche' is also pretty cool (flaming dr.pepper
gimick).
i work at 'lbjs broadcasting' there are six radio
stations in the building. i work specifically for
101X.  it is an alternative rock station.  i also make
some commercials; if you listen to the radio here-
that's me talking on the 'showpalace' & 'expose'
commercials.- yes- they are strip clubs.(no
affiliation) it also airs on 93.7fm.
how's it goin in the arm-pit of america?

i live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf.  outside of the loop is pretty ugly.  which part of houston did you grow up in?  

no i do not work for strip clubs!!!
our 'in house' production department makes comercials
for advertising companies; i.e. clubs, bars....and i
did the voice work for them!  h-town IS the armpit of
america.  i know, i've lived there all my life.  you
cannot say it isn't dirty. especially after you see a
beautiful clean place like austin. but i'm glad to know
that there are people who still love houston too.

what's my stripper name?!! nice.

Please forward to Suzanne as well.  Will you review this spreadsheet for April penalties associated with Texaco?  The volumes and prices did not look correct to me.  Let me know and I will have Anne change the value.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Attached is a spreadsheet that summarizes the possible penalties we will be charging on the six PG&E Topock April Baseload load purchases that were severely cut throughout the month.  If we use the Gas Daily High Price plus $0.15, then the total penalties will be $2,032,902, but if we use the methodology described in the contract (Gas Daily), the total penalties will be $889,377.

I spoke to Phillip while you were out to see which method we should use. He said to wait until you returned.  I also verified with Darron that from a settlements perspective, we can send penalty invoices at any time.  Let's discuss when you return.  I have copies of all of the pertinent information.

Thanks

Anne

this is correct.

Price changes have been made in Sitara.

Ellen, please reconfirm deal 576162 and 573532.

Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.
	2. SITARA #573532 should be Tiered Rate-Step:   5,000mmbtu/day @ $8.90
							10,000mmbtu/day @ $8.85

Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
Doug x3-0560            << File: PG&E Jan 2001 UNIFY - Sales.xls >>

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
"Overrated, Overrated".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called "Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al"
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
   "Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?" - Over his
   last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
   touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
   (176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
   games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
   as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
   Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
   with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
   "The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks" - What a
   joke that statement is.
   "LSU would whip UT"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
   "UT is the most overrated team in college football" - interesting since
   they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
   polls.
   "Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
   is better" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
   has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
   Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was "tiger bait, tiger bait" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

   wished
         you
         were dead, i was just kidding, and i wouldn't have to vent for so
      long
         if
         you wouldn't give me reasons to.  some of the things you said last
      night
         were pretty rude.

      It looks that way. Maybe I should sell to spark a rally. Hope things
   are
      going well otherwise. Talk to you soon.

who told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls.  

Yo Lenny,
Glad you finally pulled your big head out of Chemosabe's ass and decided to
chat with us.  Thanks for looking us up when you came to New Orleans, I
guess since none of us drink Jamison and wack off to the Sundance film
festival we're not cool...

Anyways, thanks for letting us stay at your maw's place when we go skiing.
Yes I'm going bald but your maw said that if you look good with hair then
you'll look good without it- so this year I'll shave my sack as an added
bonus...  Don't worry about saving for me a place to sleep, I'll just make a
matress out of dog hair from those slobbering, gaseous, farting bulldogs
your maw has.

Wish you were coming on the ski trip, but I realize the gay olympic trials
are in South Beach at the same time, so I understand.  Hope you qualify.

who is better for the avs to play?  what has been going on in denver?

i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it.  what is xp?

I don't know if you've seen it yet, but one of the programmers that works
for me burned me a copy of XP a couple of weeks ago . . . don't really know
how he got his hands on it, but it's pretty cool . . . I have to upgrade my
burner software due to compatibility issues . . . is your burner software
Roxio?  If so, I need you to burn me a copy . . . I'll burn you a copy of
XP if you're interested . . . the first 64 byte OS

   to
         dinner
         tomorrow night though.

             -----Original Message-----

ok.  what are you guys doing for halloween?  boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r.  i guess there is some halloween thing there.  let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later.

I don't think I'm going to be able to go.  I am so busy at work....I'm going to be here late. 

i was going to go running after work and then maybe stop by.  who all was going to go?

They are still going, but i'm not sure if i can make it yet or not.  i have sooo much work to do. 
i'll probably go, but will be late.  let me know if you want to go. 

should be 7.20.

give me a shout later.  we need to dress up and party regardless.

Yeah . . . I heard about the costume party at R&R . . . could be fun . . .
I'll talk to DeSha tonight and find out if they're gonna be in town . . .

i definately need to throw in some shit about that and all the stripper  sluts we met in vegas.  or the hooker scott hooked up with.  that would make a good speech.

Work it into your speech-- something along the line of, "And Jen, you come
from great people and have fantastic friends.  In fact Peder and I were
remarking on how agreeable they all are as the sucked on our balls last
night.  Fucking bitches!"

thanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

four way with all the bride's maids.

Dude,

What are the exact dates of the wedding?  I still haven't heard shit from
Max or Jen and I need to plan this shit.  Where are we suppose to stay?  How
much $ are you bringing with you?  Man, I feel like I'm getting married this
thing is costing me so much.

i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip?

Funny Ross,

Hey I saw that Lenhart has made his way to our email bullshit, thanks for
giving us a call this weekend when you were in town. By the way can we all
stay at your house when we are in Denver!
I promise to have Robicheaux tested before your Maw gets hit by the banjo!

i did.  

you pulled a bobbie boushay on us. that's alright.  i had a blast.

i went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.  sorry about taking off like that.  i had a good time, but i ran out of energy quick.

what happened to you at CAT"S?  we could not find you.

CKL

this is unbelievable.  seems like the worst is yet to come.  if they have to end up issuing more stock this thing can go to $10.

hey plauch, still think it is impossible for this stock to take on a one-handle.  just read below.

definately.  let me know.

oh - i forgot you said that you were going to N.O. 
i'm not driving in for the game either.  a lot of people are though. 
let me know what ya'll do for the game. 
some people are going to a happy hour at Baker Street Pub on Wednesday - if any of you 
are interested. 

should have taken the bet and given the points.  i didn't hear from you when i offered that.

I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as
whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.

how was this weekend?  did you get into anything?

i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time.  do you want to golf sat?

I'd like to go to the game, but I'm scheduled to be here on Sunday afternoon
to finish a project that goes live on Tuesday morning. I don't know if I
want to chance it with a deadline. I'd have to leave right after the game
and leave crowley early the next morning. Also, a shitload of construction
went up on i-10 this weekend b/w Lake Charles and Crowley. traffic would be
bad again. fuch it, it's on the deuce anyway.

i am definately staying in town.  i don't feel like battling that traffic.

   I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you
   and I
   didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first
   half
   to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
   stripper to go back to your place with you?

   Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
   8:00p.

   Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are
   staying
   here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.  we watched it and then went out in the french quarter.  i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows.  i don't think i want to drive in for the game.

the weekend was pretty good.  one of my friends was in from austin and 
some of us went to Cafe Adobe and Sherlock's on Friday night. 
saturday night i had a date - dinner and then to downing street. 
i had to work all day on sunday. 
what did you do?  did you watch the game at woodrow's?

Dear  Abby , 
I met Laurie at a singles dance.  I knew as soon as I looked at her that she 
was too young for me. I'm 49 and she was 32 , 17 years my junior. I really 
regretted it because we got along so well that evening. She made me feel so 
comfortable in her presence.  Our age difference didn't seem to matter to 
her as much as it did to me. 
Abby, I told her I felt people were staring at us.  I said they are probably 
wondering if I am your father.  She thought I was being silly and said if I 
wanted to see her again she would be honored to go out with me. 
Laurie and I have been dating now for three months.  I really like her and I 
think she likes me.  Still, everywhere we go, I feel people watching us. 
Sometimes they just outright stare.  It is very annoying and I know it is 
because of our age difference that draws these prolonged looks from everyone 
we meet.  I just feel so uncomfortable about this whole thing and wonder if 
I should continue with the relationship. Why do people have to be so 
rude....? 
Sincerely, 
John 
PS: I have attached a picture of Laurie.

Every thing is good here. Tom and I played golf yesterday at Fox Hollow,
beautiful day, unfortunately can't say the same for our golf game.

Enron is sure in the press. Seems like your hotdog McKinnsey ex-president
and CFO are much more adept at accounting sleights of hand than actually
running the company.

sorry i haven't called you back.  i am in portland.  i don't get back
until tonight.  i will call you when i get home.  hope all is well.

i thought i won the tie breaker.  what happened?

are you on crutches

try his email address which is pederliefkjeseth@hotmail.com.  that is the only way i know how to get in touch with him.  i haven't booked a flight yet but i will soon.  

Hey...I'm getting our wedding invites caligraphied & I don't have Peder's
new address & his phone number that I have for him is disconnected....do
you have either his phone or address, or how to get it?  Also, when are you
flying in to Fla.? & to which airport?

Take care,

i will do that.  

Please trade smaller in the future.  You are doing a great job making the markets  PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.  Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.  Make a move to get closer to your VAR.

(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=

atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=

Dear Haas Students,

Tomorrow the Haas School will hold the 5th Annual
Knowledge Forum in Andersen Auditorium 9:00 am - 3:30 pm
You are invited to drop in at any time during the day.

Attached is the program listing speakers and their bios.

David Teece
Director, Institute of Management, Innovation & Organization

Sounds good.
Best,
Jeff

thanks, I will review in detail and get back to you to discuss a plan....
bt 

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff

415.782.7854.

Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff

What's your fax #?

Greetings.  Did you folks ever send a letter to the PUC?  If so, is it
possible to get a copy?

Best,
Jeff

Getting alot of inquiries.

The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.

We'll report back as soon as something happens.

For folks who want to listen in, the number is:

415.228.4550
code = 92105

Best,
Jeff

I got the "joke."

Sure, if it's OK that I'm not from Enron.  (By the way, I said that in light of Enron's recent financial reporting difficulties).  

u wanna go?

I suggest someone from Enron definitely attend.

Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.  
 
I'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.  We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter. 
 
Reliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up.  They would of course love to have Enron "lead the charge."  I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose.
 
Best,
Jeff

Steve -- 

If you have not called SCE yet, now may be a good time to do so (given the failure of the Legislature to resolve their problems).  

Jim 

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication 

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our "Negative CTC Credits" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss. 

Thanks.    

My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.  Apologies.
 

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

Best,

Jeff

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility 
JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
Saturday, September 15, 2001 
?2001 Associated Press 

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

Wood say issue of contract renewal put off for further examination?  jeff

FYI.

SVMG ENERGY COMMITTEE MEMBERS, LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES & PRINCIPAL OFFICERS:

The California business community needs your help in opposing AB67 XX.  This
bill represents a dangerous attempt to rewrite SB78 XX, the Edison bail-out
legislation, which passed the Assembly last Friday.  After months of good
faith discussions the amendments the California Business Coalition so
strongly advocated for have been completely disregarded.  Direct Access
continues to be threatened and an unfair rate increase for large energy
users still lingers.

We urge you to contact your local delegation to express your opposition to
this inequitable legislation.  The Senate will be voting on SB67 XX
immediately.  If passed, the bill will go to the Assembly for vote tomorrow
morning.  Please contact members of both houses so that the concerns of the
California business community are clearly heard.

Attached please find the Business Coalitions floor alert, the SVMG's letter
opposing SB67 XX, as well as a spreadsheet with contact information for our
local legislative delegation.  Any effort in this regard will make a
difference.  Thank you for all of your help.

Sincerest Regards,

Carl Guardino

PLZ CALL.  DIDN'T GET WHETHER RENEWAL IS COVERED OR NOT.  JEFF 415.505.6633.

let me no how dunn call goes.  415.505.6633.  jeff

FYI.

Jeff,

My biggest concern is that we draw attantion to our QF contracts and there is pressure for us to give up our capacity payment or the CPUC futher dilutes our energy payment. I also don't think it makes sense to attack the large companies that have the DWR contracts. We generally end up working together on various issues and I do n't want to damage the relationships. I agree with many of the points John makes, but I don't want to be identified with the letter.

Enron Wind also needs to see an Edison MOU bill passed so we can get paid our past due amounts and get our five year fixed energy price on our ISO4 contracts. I plan to be in Sacramento the next couple of days and will stop by Governmental Advocates.

Hap

I will be quoted along the lines of the letter, but at this point, I'm in no hurry.

Thanks

really would like to know your thoughts on who would get the retail custome=
rs that are connected to the transmission system - stay with Pacific Gas an=
d Electric Company or go with the new PG&E Corporation.  Will they fall und=
er CPUC jurisdiction or FERC jurisdiction?  To the point, for example, woul=
d Hanson (and other similarly situated large industrials), who presently co=
nnect under the E-20T tariff today (I think there are about 100 such custom=
ers, if I remember correctly) now NOT be under CPUC jurisdiction as they ar=
e today?  Or possibly worse, would they now be under BOTH jurisdictions?  W=
hat is your opinion re direct access for this class of customers?  Would th=
at be under a FERC-approved, vs a CPUC approved, direct access tariff?  How=
 does all the stuff in the legislature that may or may not get straighted o=
ut in the 3rd emergency session anticipated by Davis interplay with this? W=
hat about surcharges?  Etc. Etc.

Anything you get on this developing story would be interesting.

It's out ...

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
"This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout," said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  "And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders." =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=

iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, "This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors."
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
"We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs," said =
Glynn.  "We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best."
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =
be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20
Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=
rs, said "This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=
esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=
ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=
r 11 process."=20
"With this plan filed," said Glynn, "we are now focused on bringing the Cha=

orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=
s' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders."

We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.  Call will be brief.  With respect to Hap, John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals.  I agreed.  I'll keep you posted.  The State Capitol is closed down completely today.  Be safe.

Serious. 

Seriously?  (I'd be happy to.) 

Call Hap and tell him I said he should back off!!! 

The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.

Best,

The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision=
, modified to be prospective only.  There is NO retroactive suspension.
=20

Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire=
ct access.  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to =
large customers and an example of the saying that, "big dogs eat first and =
big dogs eat best."  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens=
ion and no retroactivity.  He said he "finds it hard to consider these comm=
ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous."  He added that, "Smal=
l consumers effectively have no options."  He said retroactivity will be th=
e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant.  Wi=
thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t=
o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01.  He said that dire=
ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op=
ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.  He said that supporter=
s of DA engage in "hollow rhetoric."  The market has failed in the state, a=
nd, "We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec=
tric market."

He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a=
 way for making green power available to residential customers.  He respond=
ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p=
ower.  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a "fraudulent clai=
m of customer choice." <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-mic=
rosoft-com:office:office" />

Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate, responding to Wood.  He sa=
id he had learned how to count, and he can count to three.  He then briefly=
 summarized his alternate.  First, he expressed disappointment in the Sacra=
mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d=
irect access.  Second, he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from=
 that of other people.  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision=
 that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement, saying that it eliminated th=
e largest customers from direct access.  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie=
fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his =
strong support for direct access.=20

Commissioner Brown said first, "In the weight of these sad times we must ob=
ey.  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las=
t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it."  In an or=
dinary market, he thinks DA is good, but there is no way it can coexist wit=
h the State's $22 billion worth of bonds.  Therefore, there is no question =
that it has to be suspended.  "We probably should have done so months ago, =
in order to avoid a last-minute stampede."  There is an inequity between cu=
stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not.  B=
ut sometimes "you don't have a lot of good choices, and this is one of thos=
e times."  "If future legislation comes forward, and we hope that it would,=
" the Commission will attempt to revise this action.  =20

President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a =
study to be delivered by 1/1/02 as to how DA can be maintained without bias=
 to ratepayers and she supported this action.=20

Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents.=20

In conclusion, we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac=
cess suspension.  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su=
spension itself, on legal/procedural grounds.

Carole Migden indicated that they were going to meet again on Tuesday.  I
followed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed
that he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the
liberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better
off pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party
lines.  However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this
issue is better left to the Democrats.  Perhaps the liberal play will
energize Republican members.  As for moving to the left, it did not appear
as if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered
without his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly.  If in
fact they are going to stay left and the amendments they presented this
morning wind up in the bill, what does Enron think?  I have already
forwarded the DA amendments to Jeff, Jim and Mike Day.  I will send the
additional amendments momentarily.

Thanks, Scott.  Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan,
centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.  Richmond
(Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with
Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles
between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds
drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to
make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they
meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing
mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before,
with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats
crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner
their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or
leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.

Thank god.  I have a commrade in email humilation.  Thank you, Joseph.

Comrades:

It is with a sense of the most abject humiliation that
I admit to you I made a total mess of Sujan's surname
in my listing of the SAC members in yesterday's
message.

His actual moniker is:

Sujan Punyamurthula

Haas email:  punyamur@haas.berkeley.edu

My sincere apologies to Sujan for this unconscionable
oversight.  Please let it not unduly impugn my moral
credibility, and thank you all for your condescending
forebearance of my personal failings.

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,

Please update with other info.

Jim

 

Yes, would like a copy.  Thanks.

Cmmr. Bilas issued an alternate yesterday on the suspension of direct
access.  The draft is for informational purposes only -- no comments are
allowed.

Essentially the draft updates his alternate from June.  It does not suspend
direct access but opens a proceeding addressing issues surrounding the
suspension. The alternate contains some good language slamming DWR and its
potentially high price contracts.

I do not have an electronic version of the  alternate.  Let me know if you
want a faxed copy.

Jeanne Bennett          

Yes.  Likely not 100% of what you're looking for, but likely some info that will be useful.

Jim, Jeff, and Tim,
I hope all is well.  I often wish I were on the
Portland trading floor in that gov't affairs job but
that's history and my family is here in DC where they

I just interviewed to be Pat Wood's technical advisor,

hope that is ok; in my view we parted on good terms. 
He gave me the impression that I am very much in the

and don't want to compete with them.  But I think I'm
generally on the same page with you on policy issues
and I expect you would favor having more familiarity
with markets and market-oriented policies on staff
there.  Given your companies longstanding relationship
with Wood I thought you might be consulted on this. 
If so, I am asking for your support.

Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.  I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good to see you the other night.  Take care.

Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now.

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much.

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...

Hi Jeff,

I'm looking at your transcript and you've already completed 30 
units.  You're taking 7 units this semester for a total of 37 units.  You 
need 40 units to graduate.

You may want to consider adding a 3-unit this semester.  Or next semester 3 
units will cost about half, $6000.  4 or more units full price.  Just let 
me know if you want to add another class, but you may not have the time!

Just ask at our front desk, and we'll make you a copy of your latest 
transcript.

You can go to the Deals class tonight, even though you're #17 on the 
waiting list.  I'll update the status on Friday.  You may want to have a 
back-up!

See you,

The Assembly Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to take
up SBX2 78.  The bill may be taken up by the full Assembly after that,
however, that decision has not been made because several Legislators have
indicated that they may not be in Sacramento tomorrow.

The Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee is going to meet sometime today
off the floor to take up SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott) which would establish a
windfall profits tax.  Additional amendments will be taken that will make
the tax effective on January 1, 2002, define exempt wholesale generator,
marketer, broker, and aggregator, by referencing their PUC definitions, and
exempt QFs.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee will meet upon
adjournment of session today to take up SBX2 39, which would give the CPUC
regulatory authority over non-IOU generation facilities, for
reconsideration.  The bill failed passage during its prior hearing.

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee is scheduled to take
up the following bills on September 4 at 1:30 p.m.:

SBX2 85 (Burton) - This bill would prevent the CPUC, upon termination of the
10 percent rate reduction for residential and small commercial customers set
forth in subdivision (a) of Section
368, from subjecting those residential and small commercial customers to any
rate increases or future rate obligations solely as a result of the
termination of the 10 percent rate reduction.

SBX2 18 (Burton) - This bill would establish a dedicated rate component.

Thanks for the info.  No issues at my end.

California Power Authority ("CPA") held its first meeting with developers last week.  We attended and presented ourselves as a potential developer and seller of turbines to either the CPA or CPA developers.   CPA has issued a form of non-binding LOI for interested developers to sign.  It needs to be signed in the next 24 hours (!) in order to stay in the CPA program.   I would like to do that (subject to legal edits) so that we can stay at the table.  

I bring this to your attention because it may be press-released that we have reached agreement with CPA and that we are offering to build a project for the CPA. 

Please let me know if you have any issues with this.

hope that is ok; in my view we parted on good terms. 
He gave me the impression that I am very much in the
running.  I don't know if Enron people are applying
and don't want to compete with them.  But I think I'm
generally on the same page with you on policy issues
and I expect you would favor having more familiarity
with markets and market-oriented policies on staff
there.  Given your companies longstanding relationship
with Wood I thought you might be consulted on this. 
If so, I am asking for your support.
Thanks!

Apologies, but any chance of doing it before noon central, or after 4 pm centra.?

I have scheduled Michael Tribolet for a conference call for Friday at 1:00 central, 11:00 Pacific to discuss options on this QF proposal.  Please let me know of your availability for this call.

Great.  Look forward to the call.

We are in the process of calculating EWS's potential short position on gree=
n power that could result from an RPS in California. We should have definit=
ive numbers by mid-day tomorrow. We are working with Steve Swain and Jeff R=
ichter to assess the exposure, running our commodity short against $1.50, $=
3.00 and $7.00 green curves. Numbers will eventually be adjusted for contra=
cts with pass-through clauses. We can discuss the results on our conference=
 call tomorrow.

I want to make sure that Jeff Richter from the power desk knows about this =
potential increased cost.

=09=09=09As you may know, at Jim's request, Stacey Bolton reviewed the rene=

=20

these bills (copied below, for your reference). =20

=09=09=09How do you suggest we proceed?  Shall I arrange a brief call for u=

=09=09=09Jennifer =20

=09=09=09***************
=09=09=09Overall Concerns: =20
=09=09=09=091.=09The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilat=
eral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid p=
resents limitations and could drive up costs.
=09=09=09=092.=09It's unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from =
the underlying commodity.  The above requirement indicates that it is not. =
 This would negatively impact, and even negate the main reasons to have a R=
EC trading program - to provide flexibility and act as verification for the=
 RPS.
=09=09=09=093.=09The biomass definition is too limiting.  Would be difficul=
t to detail this amount of information on a REC.  Need to have language tha=
t distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not.
=09=09=09=094.=09Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed lan=
guage in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Departm=
ent of Water Resources (SB 532 only) is instructed to purchase renewables o=
n their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities.
=09=09=09=095.=09While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective, =
it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the ren=
ewable premiums for new sources.

=09=09=09 -----Original Message-----
=09=09=09The concerns that I listed at the end of the memo are the ones tha=
t I believe need to be addressed and clarified if it appears one of these b=
ills are moving forward at a rapid pace.  Thanks!

 << File: virtual energy markets.doc >> 

Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

Thank you.

This is to follow up on the message I left you last week responding to your inquiry to my colleague Jeff Dasovich for some information.  Please let me know if there is something you are still looking for.

Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m=
emory

(Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20

Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in =
decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics=
.=20

The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D=
avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining=
 its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is =
odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll=
ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20

Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=
 around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea=
ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util=
ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft=
er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo=
th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l=
ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta=
il rates.=20

Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a=
spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i=
tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad=
vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi=
slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to =
do.=20

Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s=
uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin=
ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi=
ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft=
er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str=
ong as PG&E's.=20

The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal=
ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians=
 do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E=
dison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd=
s. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou=
t for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme =
because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed =
under state control.=20

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or=
dinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc=
h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis=
 put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition =
that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g=
overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20

Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" nea=
r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo=
rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St=
reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20

Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso=
n. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry=
son was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong=
 ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b=
y Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la=
unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20

The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ=
opher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. Bryson a=
nd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak=
e command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch =
the red ink. Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to=
 keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.=20

We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, v=
ery soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.=

For Montana Power, a Broadband Dream
May Turn Out to Be More of a Nightmare

By BILL RICHARDS 
Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

BUTTE, Mont. -- This is a gamblers' town. More than a century ago, Marcus Daly turned a bet on a copper vein under Butte into the giant Anaconda Co. The gambling game Keno was invented here for bored miners. In 1974, stuntman Evel Knievel, a Butte native, made headlines betting -- unsuccessfully -- that he could jump the Snake River Canyon on his rocket-powered motorcycle.

Now, Bob Gannon, another Butte native, and chairman and chief executive of Montana Power Co., is betting he can pull off his own breathtaking stunt: He plans to turn his staid 89-year-old utility into a high-tech high-flier.

 [gannon] <http://interactive.wsj.com/public/resources/images/Gannon_Bob-FM23808212001221914.gif>

In one dizzying two-year stretch, the Butte-based utility has sold just about all its assets -- power plants, transmission lines, dams, gas, coal and oil fields -- pouring much of the $1.6 billion take into a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network. By the end of this year, Mr. Gannon boasts, Montana Power will have 26,000 miles of fiber in the ground, a new corporate name, Touch America, and it will be among the nation's largest half-dozen broadband companies.

So far, Mr. Gannon's gamble seems to be following the same trajectory as Mr. Knievel's. The joke around here is that at least Mr. Knievel wore a parachute.

Indeed, while plenty of companies have been hammered by the telecommunications bust, few have taken a more severe beating than Montana Power. Under Mr. Gannon's leadership, the company sold out of the energy business just as electric rates were taking off and bought into broadband as it was poised to tank. Now, only 5% to 10% of Touch America's fiber is being used.

Mr. Gannon's makeover of the venerable utility has touched off warfare here, pitting Montana Power against regulators, investors, consumer advocates and its own former corporate customers. The company's stock, which hit a high of $65 a share five days after Mr. Gannon announced his decision to dump the utility business in March of last year, has spiralled downward since. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, it was at $7.90.

The decision by Montana Power's board to authorize a 6.6 million share buyback during the plunge didn't boost Mr. Gannon's image either. The spree cost the company $204.8 million; the purchased shares are now valued at about $52 million.

But perhaps most galling to Montanans are the huge gains made by PPL Corp., the Pennsylvania utility that bought Montana Power's electric generating plants. PPL has sold nearly a third of the plants' power out-of-state at a huge markup, producing record profits. Meanwhile, state utility regulators, angry at Mr. Gannon's refusal to share proceeds of the asset sale with customers, have locked his company into a painful contract: Montana Power is required to continue supplying power to its 288,000 customers until 2007, even though it owns no more power plants. That has forced the company to purchase electricity from PPL. Montana Power, which is barred from raising customer rates, has been losing money on the transactions.

Long, Expensive Fight

The five-member utility commission could decide to let Montana Power boost its rates next year. But the high price of providing power has already drained the company's coffers. To cut back on its expenses, Montana Power agreed in June to pay $62.5 million to cancel the last year-and-a-half of a long-term supply contract with one of its biggest commercial customers, Butte-based Advanced Silicon Materials.

Last week, in an unusual lawsuit filed in state district court in Helena, eight Montana Power shareholders charged the utility, its board, and its senior executives and consultants with a "breach of fiduciary duty" for failing to get shareholders' approval for the company's transformation. The suit seeks a rollback of Mr. Gannon's makeover, charging the effort has cost shareholders $3 billion. It also seeks to return to shareholders what it calls PPL's "illegal" gains from power sales.

"We're trying to salvage the pension funds of thousands of Montanans who are wrapped up in this company," says Frank Morrison Jr., a former state Supreme Court justice and one of the attorneys filing the suit. Six of the state's largest law firms collaborated on the suit, Mr. Morrison says, "because we anticipate a long, expensive fight." Montana Power would not discuss its reasons for not seeking shareholder approval for the makeover but says it has done nothing wrong and will defend itself vigorously.

All this has tattered Mr. Gannon's reputation as a hometown genius. Just last year, Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan. He was cheered during the company's annual meeting, a folksy conclave held at Butte's Mother Lode Theater that is part business session, part homecoming party. More than a third of the company's registered shareholders live in Montana.

But this year, angry shareholders and customers have picketed the company's headquarters, and Web sites are springing up across the state to rally voters to punish Montana Power. Earlier this month, Michelle Lee, a Democratic legislator from Livingston, launched Dumpthedeal.com (www.dumpthedeal.com <http://www.dumpthedeal.com/>1), a Web site urging a referendum to repeal deregulation of the electric industry in Montana. She says the site drew more than 1,000 visitors in its first two weeks.

"A lot of people here just can't believe what's happened to Montana Power,'' says Ralph McCaughy, who retired from the company's data-processing department three years ago. Mr. McCaughy, who is 62 years old and has throat cancer, says he and his wife, Jean, had planned to use some of their Montana Power shares and dividends to buy a new car to replace their wheezy 1993 Honda and take a trip to Hawaii. Montana Power stopped paying dividends last year as part of the makeover.

Mr. McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold. "I don't know whether Gannon and the bunch running the company couldn't stop themselves or what," he says.

Enduring Hecklers

These days, strangers sometimes blow raspberries and heckle Mr. Gannon during his daily two-block trek from his office to Gamer's, a local luncheonette that features a Butte specialty -- pork-chop sandwiches. The fact that Montana Power -- always one of the state's most powerful political forces -- led the lobbying drive for deregulation in the state hasn't helped his popularity. Deregulated electricity prices soared so high here last summer that several large Montana companies that had elected to buy power on the open market closed or cut back operations.

Steven Walsh, president of Montana Resources, which operates part of Anaconda's open-pit mine in Butte, says he shut the mine and laid off 322 people last summer after his electricity bill jumped to $627 a megawatt hour from $26 an hour in a week. Prices have begun to come down, but the mine is still shut.

"I don't hold any animosity toward Bob Gannon," Mr. Walsh says. "But around here I guess the general feeling is they made a big mistake."

Despite the company's battered stock price, some Wall Street analysts say they still have hope for the transformation, and they note that Touch America -- which expects to have $1.6 billion in assets, including $350 million in cash -- has a stronger balance sheet than most of its telecom competition.

Defending His Position

Mr. Gannon denies rumors that he has been punched out in several Butte bars, but Montana Power's Internet message boards are sizzling with rants by angry investors threatening to show up at this year's Sept. 14 annual meeting with tar, feathers, or worse.

"Bob's a decent human being and I still like the guy," says Paul Cote, the owner of Gamer's. "But I have heard people bad-mouthing him. There's a lot of people upset with him right now."

Mr. Gannon, who can see the house where he grew up -- beyond the Hock-It-To-Me pawnshop -- from his office window, defends his makeover decision. Energy deregulation during the late 1990s doomed smaller regional utilities such as Montana Power, he says, while fiber optics was becoming a glamour industry. The company had begun laying fiber-optic lines in the 1980s. As the business began to take off in the 1990s, Mr. Gannon and others believed they had a solid head start.

"There's a lot of second-guessing taking place now," he says. "But we were the ones sitting in the chair, and we made a decision that was absolutely correct and justified."

Others blame Montana Power's problems on overreaching by Mr. Gannon and the utility's management, as well as on strong salesmanship by Goldman Sachs, Montana Power's investment bankers. Critics of the deal have suggested that Montana Power's 11-member board -- stocked with seven Montanans -- might not have fully appreciated the risks and challenges of the fiber-optic business.

"They were intoxicated by their stock price and Wall Street was telling them, 'Hey, you're on a roll,' " says Robert Anderson, a Public Service Commission member. "These were utility guys. What did they know about the telecommunications business?"

Mr. Gannon and other senior officials who were part of the Policy Leadership Group, a Montana Power internal decision-making team, say that until shortly before last year's makeover announcement they hadn't decided to turn Montana Power into a telecom. At first, Mr. Gannon says, the group had been "comfortable" with a more limited step: an initial public offering of the Touch America unit. The group also considered spinning off Touch America to Montana Power's shareholders or continuing to build it up within the company, he says.

Goldman Sachs, which has worked with the utility for 17 years, urged the company's management to drop its power business entirely, company officials say. Goldman specialists from New York, Los Angeles and Chicago made more than 100 visits to Butte, camping at the Copper King Motel and advising the utility executives on their options. As the discussions went on, company officials say, divestiture of the power business seemed the most logical choice. Mr. Gannon and others say Goldman's bankers warned that the IPO market was losing its luster and urged them to sell their power-making assets quickly to get the best price.

Matt Darnell, a Goldman managing director who advised Montana Power on its move toward telecommunications, declines to give specifics of Goldman's recommendations to either the policy group or Montana Power's board. "There were numerous options explored," he says, "but we certainly supported the thoughtful and deliberative approach the board took."

Of the subsequent downward turn of events, Mr. Darnell says: "The telecommunications industry has taken a turn no one expected."

For its advice, Goldman will get 2.5% of the gross payout from the asset sale, or about $14.2 million, a Montana Power spokesman says. Goldman officials say they are no longer advising Montana Power on its business plan.

Mr. Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move. In a strongly worded letter last week, he urged shareholders to approve the final pieces of his makeover plan at the Sept. 14 annual meeting. He warned that if the shareholders rejected the measures, Montana Power's board would seek to accomplish the divestiture of the utility business through unspecified "other methods."

Demand for fiber-optic networks will regain strength before long, Mr. Gannon says. When it does, Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition. Mr. Gannon says his company will emerge as one of the telecom industry's strongest national players, with no debt and a state-of-the-art technology.

"There are a lot of suggestions in watering holes around this state that Goldman was flying around the West looking for a bunch of guys to dupe and that we were a bunch of rubes from Montana who got taken in," he says. "That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard."

With Jim in Sacramento tomorrow, and hearings scheduled to discuss addition=

Best,
Jeff

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,
some failed and most of them served to further confuse the committee
members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by
TURN and other consumer groups.

During the hearing Hedy had the opportunity to speak to Nancy McFadden and
Richard Katz from the Governor=19 s office regarding a couple of issues
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently,
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff=19 s request.  D.J. agreed that the =
bill
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard abou=
t
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct
access.  We suggested that =1C shall=1D be changed to =1C may=1D in order t=
o give more
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn=19 t necessarily op=
pose
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can
totally rewrite it (which he later attempted to do).

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to
push Edison into bankruptcy (along with the Canadian government) if this
bill passes.

There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governor=19 s
desk.

The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately 1:30 p.m. to vote o=

additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill.

Thanks very much.  FYI. Steffes is coming to Sacramento tomorrow.  I'll be bringing him back to SF in the PM and he'll be in the office on Thursday and at least part of Friday.

Apologies, forgot to mention that the "consumer" groups generally don't have a problem allowing Edison to pay off its debt to the QFs.

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

Mike:
A few thoughts:
Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.
If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.
The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.
I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.
On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Let's look some more.  I don't think there's anything that would disqualify any plants.

Elliot-
 
Take a close look at the language in this bill regarding the RPS. On page 7, lines 29-33, the bill states that all power must be under a direct contract to a retail seller. While this does provide us potential opportunities for scheduling and commodity management as Stacey pointed out, it also prevents merchant plants from qualifying as renewable. This would eliminate our service customers such as Delano, Wheelabrator, and Shasta. The link to the bill itself is:

Sarah,
 
Nice chatting with you. As I mentioned we are looking for an assistant analyst to work in the communications software and wireless area. 
 
My current coverage list includes Openwave, Palm, RIMM, Handspring, Comverse, Aether, Nuance, SpeechWorks, etc. Given the way our business is growing and evolving, we will be moving towards names like Qualcomm, Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson in the very near future. We are looking for all of the clich? characteristics: motivated, high level of initiative, self disciplined, high attention to detail, good writing skills, modeling experience, blah, blah, blah. Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR.

Dan.  You might want to amend.  The decision puts everyone on notice that t=
he Commission is going to consider taking it back to July 1---no info on wh=
at the decision process would be.
=20
Best,
Jeff

The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision=
, modified to be prospective only.  There is NO retroactive suspension.
=20

Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire=
ct access.  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to =
large customers and an example of the saying that, "big dogs eat first and =
big dogs eat best."  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens=
ion and no retroactivity.  He said he "finds it hard to consider these comm=
ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous."  He added that, "Smal=
l consumers effectively have no options."  He said retroactivity will be th=
e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant.  Wi=
thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t=
o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01.  He said that dire=
ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op=
ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.  He said that supporter=
s of DA engage in "hollow rhetoric."  The market has failed in the state, a=
nd, "We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec=
tric market."

He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a=
 way for making green power available to residential customers.  He respond=
ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p=
ower.  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a "fraudulent clai=
m of customer choice."=20

Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate, responding to Wood.  He sa=
id he had learned how to count, and he can count to three.  He then briefly=
 summarized his alternate.  First, he expressed disappointment in the Sacra=
mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d=
irect access.  Second, he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from=
 that of other people.  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision=
 that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement, saying that it eliminated th=
e largest customers from direct access.  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie=
fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his =
strong support for direct access.=20

Commissioner Brown said first, "In the weight of these sad times we must ob=
ey.  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las=
t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it."  In an or=
dinary market, he thinks DA is good, but there is no way it can coexist wit=
h the State's $22 billion worth of bonds.  Therefore, there is no question =
that it has to be suspended.  "We probably should have done so months ago, =
in order to avoid a last-minute stampede."  There is an inequity between cu=
stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not.  B=
ut sometimes "you don't have a lot of good choices, and this is one of thos=
e times."  "If future legislation comes forward, and we hope that it would,=
" the Commission will attempt to revise this action.  =20

President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a =
study to be delivered by 1/1/02 as to how DA can be maintained without bias=
 to ratepayers and she supported this action.=20

Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents.=20

In conclusion, we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac=
cess suspension.  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su=
spension itself, on legal/procedural grounds.

Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.

Go for it. 

Do we need to disucss this further?  I'd like to explore the Ose angle especially in light of the press interest. 

FYI. 

Pat, you think Ose would run with this? Seems like potentially explosive stuff. 

Best, 
Jeff 

Since Congressman's Ose's been asking FERC alot of questons about what the ISO, DWR, etc. have been up to, perhaps he could write a "Dear FERC" letter saying "here's what I'm hearing, it sounds serious and you need to investigate, pronto, and get back to me ASAP with your conclusions."

Best, 
Jeff 

Everyone, 

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito: 

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 

9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative: 

Issue highlighted in blue lettering. This is being researched internally and 
an ISO response on how these transactions are being handled should be 
forthcoming, I would think.

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at 
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about 
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this 
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it 
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time. 

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the 
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being 
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts 
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have 
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to 
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I 
have understood this correctly. 

Thanks a lot for your assistance. 

Caroline 

10.  Here is an e-mail from the intrepid and vigilant Kit Blair, in Volume Management, who first brought this scam to my attention.

Steve, 
        Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

will do.

Calif Consumer Group Steps Up Opposition To SoCal Ed Bill    
Updated: Monday, August 27, 2001 04:55 PM ET     
  

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Three weeks before the state legislature adjourns, a California consumer group is stepping up efforts to oppose a rescue deal for Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) insolvent utility Southern California Edison, a spokesman for The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said Monday. 

The group has set up a war room in a hotel one block from the state's capitol, which it will use to organize citizen volunteers from around the state. The volunteers, who will wear black and yellow armbands for easy identification, will meet with lawmakers and report on legislative developments to the media and to community groups, said spokesman Doug Heller. 

   

"We want politicians to know they are being watched and that an Edison bailout is unacceptable," Heller said. 

A bill is currently being heard by an Assembly committee to rescue SoCal Ed by allowing it to issue up to $2.9 billion in bonds backed by ratepayer revenue. The utility has $3.5 billion in undercollections because it couldn't pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate freeze. 

The foundation, which believes the bill will result in rate increases beyond the two already instituted this year, is setting up a telephone line with near-daily updates on legislative developments, Heller said. 

The consumer group plans to sponsor a 2002 ballot measure to overturn an Edison bill if it passes. In the past, the group has helped overturn legislation on property taxes and insurance rates through ballot initiatives. 

"We've done some test mailing on this and have had a real positive response from the public. We're ready to do a mail-based campaign if the legislature screws up," Heller said. 

About 25,000 people have already signed an online "anti-bailout" petition, according to the foundation's Web site.

THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
"This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no
longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated
electricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the
effective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm
to customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:
(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all
transactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X
if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,
2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate
date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date."
 
The specific wording in the Decision is:
 
"The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until
DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should
be suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;
and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of
providing cost stability for current direct access customers, written
contracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the
suspension for the initial term of the contracts."
 
It also provides that:

"In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for
the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as
soon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the
parties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that
direct access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission
postponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not
change the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was
introduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February
1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have
now had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish
to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in
the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this
switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service
from the utility." 

The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues
which would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,
disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in
strong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?  It might be a good idea to
have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a
movement to counter this.

If Legal analysis indicates that we can make a strong case for either
hearings, or a change of date, Mirant would be a supporter. Due to time
constraints, we may not be available to contribute to strategy discussions
in the next day or two, however. If the group comes up with an action that
it believes makes good sense, Mirant will participate. - - Steve

THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
"This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no

date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date."

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," Davis told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
"There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall

I just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and Scott has faxed.  Jim, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per Scott's note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether Davis will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (Edison bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  Will report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

Best,
Jeff

Jennifer --

Can you get a copy of the SBX2 1 and provide short synopsis?

Thanks,

Jim

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

Mark:  Did you get a copy of this from Mike Day?

Can you please get a copy of their Expansion filing in time for our visit this Friday?

Dow Jones Newswires

Calif Power Consultant Failed To Reveal Energy Co. Stake

By JASON LEOPOLD

   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES -- A top energy consultant hired by to negotiate long-term power contracts for the state of California failed to disclose that he held stock in a company with which the state signed a $1 billion power supply pact last month, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

Vikram Budraja filed an amended financial disclosure form Aug. 13 listing holdings of between $2,000 and $10,000 in stock in ScottishPower (SPI), whose subsidiary PacifiCorp Power Marketing signed a $1 billion, 10-year power contract with the state Department of Water Resources on July 6.

Budraja failed to disclose the information in a form he filed in July, after energy consultants hired by Gov. Gray Davis came under fire for failing to file routine financial disclosure forms.

Budraja's August economic disclosure form states that he sold his ScottishPower shares July 30 on the advice of his lawyer. He purchased the shares "pre-96," according to the form.

Davis's office has sent a copy of Budraja's amended filing to the state's Fair Political Practices Committee for review, said Bill Kissinger, Deputy Legal Affairs adviser for Davis.

The FPPC is conducting an investigation into a handful of the DWR's consultants who held stock in energy companies while working on behalf of the state buying power and negotiating contracts, Kissinger said.

The DWR, which is handling the job of buying power in lieu of California's insolvent utilities, said Budraja didn't negotiate the contract with PacifiCorp. The department disclosed the contract on Aug. 17.

Stephen Kaufman, a lawyer representing the Electric Power Group and Budraja, also said Budraja didn't help negotiate the contract. Kaufman added that Budraja's ScottishPower holdings were tied up in an IRA and that Budraja hadn't even realized he held stock in the company until a review of his financial records was undertaken recently.

"A decision was made upon reviewing all of Mr. Budraja's assets to disclose this to the public given all the activities going on and the press accounts," Kaufman said. "The signing of the contract was of no consequence in deciding whether or not it should be sold. This was a very small holding that was part of an IRA purchased prior to 1996. He did not remember or realize he had this holding until after this situation blew up and took a look at all of his holdings."

     Political Battle Continues

Budraja included the following comment with his renewed filing:

"The information contained in the two previously filed form 700s was provided pursuant to a series of instructions provided by the Department of Water Resources starting on June 15, 2001, that my disclosure should reflect the facts that existed on the date you first began working for the California Energy Resources Scheduling," Budraja wrote, referring to the Department of Water Resources' power-buying arm. "This amended form is filed to list information not previously provided based upon consultation with and advice of legal counsel regarding the disclosure required by the Political Reform Act."

The disclosure is the latest in a battle over possible conflicts of interest waged by Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis, a Democrat, next year for governor.

Jones began pressing consultants hired by Davis' administration in July to disclose their shareholdings in energy companies. Once they did, Jones asked federal and state regulators to investigate possible insider trading and conflicts of interest.

Budraja, a former Edison International (EIX) vice president, is one of the state's two main power-contract negotiators. Electric Power Group is under contract to plan and execute the DWR's power purchases and to help coordinate between the agency and other state offices. His firm has 10 employees under contract to the DWR. Electric Power Group is to receive $6.2 million for those services through Dec. 31, 2002.

As reported, investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Budraja's shareholdings. The consultant has confirmed receiving a letter from the SEC informing him of the inquiry and asking him to supply information regarding his investments as of Jan. 1.

In July, Budraja disclosed holding in Edison International and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), both of which he sold after he began working for the state.

The state's contract with PacifiCorp was negotiated by Richard Ferreira, the former Sacramento Municipal Utility District executive, and a representative from Navigant consulting, said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.

Ferreira was fired in late July because he held stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN) while negotiating long-term contracts with the company, according to Davis' office.

The Republican leadership in the state Legislature has called for oversight hearings into the state's $43 billion in long-term power contracts, as well as its spot-market purchases. The Democratic majority has yet to respond to the request.

Forgot to include my Sempra analysis in the package -- revised package

I am sick of keeping track of lots of little documents, so I have assembled in one document and attached the latest version of my contract descriptions.  I have addressed Stefan Bird's comments, cleaned up the Calpine peakers piece to answer Rich Ferguson's questions, and made a few other generally minor revisions.

Morning.  FYI.  Good 'ol SDG&E.
=20
Best,
Jeff

Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos=
t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c=
omments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motio=
n, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec=
ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for=
 SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which me=
ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Satur=
day).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:

  _____ =20

"Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t=
o which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of=
 direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =
is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=
ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =
an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=
 San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=
tments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=
ect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=
usses below how to provide for this coordination.=20

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=
ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =
stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=
 and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =
access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=
 summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=
t access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=
f. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=
 result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=
id paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=
nd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=
e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=
nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=
ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=
e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=
ss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=
 open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=
ions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=
ormation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=
tion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =
period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=
ed to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=
ts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=
stomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =
use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=
n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =
over- or under-commitment.=20

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=
rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=
nd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=
ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=
imit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=
n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=
ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=
ustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=
dity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access=
 prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing,=
 again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
=20
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-t=
erm period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan."

  _____ =20

The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____ =20

"When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take=
 advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although C=
alifornia's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is stil=
l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul=
atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states hav=
e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short req=
uirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auct=
ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. Ca=
lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portio=
n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpo=
int, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequa=
te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi=
tion remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee=
s should also apply."

  _____ =20

There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up=
on, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please=
 let me (and others) know if you agree.

Might be a good idea to check in and see if he's got what he needs.  Thanks a million for the help.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

As you know, last Tuesday I left message for Harald Jensen in EES to follow-up to his request.  I have not heard back from him. Shall I contact him again or just wait for him to get back to us?

Jennifer

Greetings Ms J:

Could you do me a favor and call harold jenson (sp?) in EES and see what he's looking for?  He's apparently looking for deregulation info about CA.  Greatly indebted, as always.

Unfortunately, I'm not likely to get to the CERA conference.

Best,
Jeff

Not quite sure why you're on this.  I think you can pass.

Thanks for message re: Sanders.

Best,
Jeff

Do you know what this call is for?  And should I be on it? thx. kd

Dear All,

I apologize for the late notice on this message, hopefully we'll be able to get some of you on the call.

This call is being held to discuss in advance of the DSTAR Advisory Meeting on Wed Aug 29 our comments as they relate to Appendix P and how we want to strategically address the problems with the TOs removing several key items, including the "right-of-first refusal language.

Call in particulars:

Time: 9:00 AM PDT, 11:00 AM CDT

Phone:.422.7171, ParticipantCode 937022. 

Kind Regards,

Dave

Sue's back today.  She and I can get info for you today.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

Per below, Jim thought you might be able to help with this if Sue is on vacation.  Linda and I met with Sen. Feinstein's chief of staff last week and I will be calling her energy person this week to meet next week.  Thanks.

John

John -

I think that Sue is still on vacation.  Jeff may be able to help.

Jim
Sue --

Just checking to see if there is any new word from IEP on the draft Feinstein legislation you had sent earlier.  I have quietly alerted others in town -- such as EPSA and INGAA.  NGSA -- the group that represents the natural gas producers -- is aware and sending comments to her this week.  We have heard conflicting reports about whether she still intends to pursue the legislation -- at least on a stand alone basis -- and how much of a priority should will place on it in relation to other energy issues.  I intend to call her energy staffer next week to sit down before the Senate Energy Committee resumes votes in September.  Any news on this issue would be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

Sorry.  I've been swamped trying to save direct access for the ingrates in CA.  I'll get it right out to you by fax.

Sue --

Jim forwarded your e-mail on the Feinstein legislation (draft).  While she has talked about her interests conceptually in various hearings and meetings, we have not yet seen draft legislative language or more details.  If you have draft language or more details (which it sounded like from your e-mail), please forward and we can discuss.  Thanks for your assistance.

John

John -

Can you please get with Sue?

thx

I assume you're all over this, Linda.

On the off chance that you haven't seen it.  Feinstein is asking IEP for comments on her draft legislation that would increase regulation of natural gas, define what just and reasonable rates would be and increase refund power on the electric side.  I think we would have some concerns with her proposal.  If you want to pass along our comments to IEP, just get them to me.

Apologies for missing the call yesterday.  As I'm sure you're aware, yesterday the PUC voted to suspend electric direct acces in California.  As a result, it was an extremely hectic day.  I do intend to make the weekly calls.

Best,
Jeff

Hey, when do regional directors begin reporting to Steffes?  Any sense of the reasoning behing the org change?

Thanks for coming over last night.  Very fun.  Great to see you.  Really glad you guys joined in.

Best,
Jeff

CALIFORNIA PUC APPROVES PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY PLAN TO UPGRADE
POWER SYSTEM IN TRI-VALLEY

 <<011010r.doc>>

That's exactly right.  But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.

Best,
Jeff

PS Can you give a call when you get a minute at 415.782.7822?  Thanks.

It was held only after Brown insisted that it be held and only after Loretta
took a voice vote to over-rule Brown's hold.  Duque and Bilas joined Brown
in taking the item off the agenda.  I saw Brown this morning.  He's pissed
and he called Loretta a liar.  Somehow, he knew what was going to happen and
he prevented it.

you mean to hold it?

Well, it looks like Loretta isn't as smart as she thinks she is....

FYI.  QFs meeting with Edison today.  Edison has not yet offered information on 1) date certain when QFs will be paid what they're owed, or 2) when the 5.37 cents will kick in.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is the finalized letter to fielder re the QF/SCE MOU Agreement
implementation.  PLEASE DISREGARD THE EARLIER EMAIL, AS IT CONTAINRD THE
FIRST DRAFT OF THE LETTER, NOT THE FINAL VERSION.

Mike:  Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?  I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

IEP reported on its Leg call today that Burton told Davis -- don't even think about trying to replace Loretta as the President of the CPUC because she is the only President he will support (the Senate has to approve the appointment, apparently)

Sue

An SVP from Edison just informed us that Edison will be sending out by email information on DASR acceptance/rejection.
He said that all DASRs submitted prior to midnight on 9.20.01 will be accepted, irrespective of whether Edison subsequently rejected them for inadequate information, adminstrative or other reasons.
He said that they will also be asking ESPs to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 9.20.01 and for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.
When the DASRs for those contracts are submitted, he said that Edison will accept them, so long as they track the list previously submitted.
I asked if Edison would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1.
He said he didn't believe they intended to do that, but he said that they did intend to lobby the Commission to make sure that newly-minted DA customers don't escape any costs they're responsible for.

Please forward this along to anyone else who might need the information.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  Sure you've seen it, but just in case.  Non-energy-related friend of mine emailed it to me.

Best,
Jeff

Related Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at
Enron

By Stephen Taub

The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a
prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." 

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC
filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. 

As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall
Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses. 

REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED
Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial
Times. 

Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues
climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. 

The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of
its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the
first half of this year. 

"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told
the FT. 

Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through August 31. 

Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local
currency terms, according to the paper. 

Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt
covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.

Hey, man, how'd the dinner go?  You get everything squared away with the Legislator?

Best,

Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?

Best,
Jeff

PS Where's my email Ms Perfect?

The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks very much.

purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)
2001-09-21 16:39 (New York)

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)

     (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.)

     Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''
said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.

     Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.

Seems like something IEP would certaintly be way out in front on. After suppliers' last experience with the PUC's planning process, seems like they'd aggressively go after its return in a very big way.

Dave and company,

Here we go again.  Dave, is this anything you want us to engage in?  Jim, what do you think about this?

The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
"retirement."

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to "integrated resource
planning."  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to "integrated resource planning"
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

The generators are going to go nuts over this.  They'll do all the pounding needed on their own.  Calpine will likely lead the charge, which should be interesting....

I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?

I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.

Greetings.  You taking the course?  It looks very good to me and I've added it.  If you're taking it, could you let me know what the assignment is for Tuesday?  I'm on vacation, and the course hasn't yet been added to my Izio account.

Greetings, Comrades, and welcome back (for two thirds
of you, and for you first years:  don't forget to
breathe).

I am compelled (Diane Dimeff stands behind me with a
Louisville Slugger slapping menacingly against one
palm) to tell you that Haas has a Complaint
Department, namely the Student Advisory Committee
(SAC).  

The SAC is a formalized conduit for presenting the
School Administration with your thoughts, suggestions,
responses, recommendations, kisses and hugs of
appreciation as well as rants and rodomontades of
angry frustration on any subject with respect to your
experience at Haas.  We do this by means of the
Student Survey (more on this later), our distinguished
teacher awards (more on this later, too) and by
listening to you when all others have grown weary of
your whining.   

The Committee  currently consists of the following
students (we are looking for a couple of
representatives from among the first years, but more
on this later, as you probably suspected):

Eric Jordan, jordan@haas.berkeley.edu
Lesley Keffer, keffer@haas...
Sujan Punyamur, punyanur@haas...
Deepika Shah, dshah@haas...
Joseph Tambornino (me), Chairman, tamborni@haas...

Feel free to flag any of us down (especially Deepika
since she's the easiest to talk to) if you have a
gripe, a brainstorm, or a question about Haas that
Diane and her team have not already triaged for you. 
(Be forewarned, however: we will not reveal the secret
formula to Berk's Finance case.)

Best wishes in reacclimating yourself to school.  (At
least it gives you something to do if the dotcom bust
has left you "downsized," "rightsized," "laid off" or
otherwise dumped by your old employer.  Heck, who
needs them anyway?  Go start your own digital
revolution.)

o lord, there's not some reason that we'll need to go to Napa next weekend that I don't know about, it there? Just you guys going up to visit, right?

I will send you the email later today.

We were planning on looking at hotels in the Santa Cruz area again this
weekend and hanging out with Lizanne and Ken.  We are going to Napa next
weekend, so I really didn't want to go up twice.  Unlike you guys (who
practically live up there), I like to take my parents in smaller doses.  I
will be sure to send some flowers.

Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary
this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window
and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering
if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your
note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday
morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch
football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary
thing?

Best,

ALL FARES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE UNTIL TICKETED/PURCHASED

The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Hello Environmental and Energy Committee Members:

Please see the following request from Dr. Kenneth Lim of the BAAQMD.  The
information he seeks is in support of a petition for additional State
funding for BAAQMD programs.  I understand how short the notice is, but if
you can provide Dr. Lim some information, I think he and the BAAQMD would be
very appreciative.  If you would like to send me your data, I will forward
it to Ken Lim without your company information.

Sincerely,

Margaret Bruce
Director, Environmental Programs
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group

     Ms. Margaret Bruce:
     SVMG

     Hi Margaret:

     I had sent this message to Justin Bradley last week, but have not
     heard back from him.  I should have sent it to you also.

     I hope that things are going well with you.

     I'm trying to assess the emissions impact of increased Back-Up
     Generator (BUG) diesel fuel use from 2000 to 2001.  I need real data
     to support an effort to get state funds to help mitigate the
     additional emissions in the Bay Area.  This is NOT for compliance,
     enforcement, or rulemaking, etc. purposes.  I could use your help.

     I would need 2000 and 2001 data for diesel fuel use or hours of BUG
     operation:

     BUG engine, hp, fuel use 2000 and 2001 to date.  One comparison might
     be 10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     We want to verify, if it is true, that business and industry felt
     compelled by the energy situation to operate their diesel BUGs more
     hours and burn more fuel (fuel readiness testing and emergency backup
     power) than in past comparable periods.

     I was hoping that you could provide some actual use data for the
     back-up diesel engines at your SVMG member companies.  I would need
     specific engine information as indicated above.  The data information
     can be as simple as total diesel fuel use for the first 9 months of
     2000 versus the first 9 mos. of 2001.  Ideally, we would prefer
     10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     I'm seeking this information at your earliest convenience (by the end
     of the day Wednesday).  Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any
     questions.  My apologies for this short notice (I did send in an
     inquiry to Justin on 10/22/01).  Thanks very much for your
     consideration.

Tom --

I received a call today from the CPUC (came through the main Enron number) - a CPUC staffer named Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

Someone named Dan at the Quail Ridge Research Station (7001 Hwy 128 Napa, CA 94558) called the CPUC to complain that he was inappropriately switched from PG&E to Enron.  It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that "the facility isn't anywhere near the campus."

The PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.  His phone number is 503-752-0873.  

I told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business Thursday.

The CPUC staffer is Joyce at 415-703-2199 (no one was interested in giving the last names).

My guess is that UC/CSU listed this account on a switch request but didn't ask Dan.  What should we do??

Jim

why did we agree to give Rod Wright $20K?

Hey, we kid!  Where'd we be without our humor?  Have a great weekend; thanks for taking the time to talk today.

Best,
Jeff

Under the circumstances, I am leaning toward cancelling (I was originally only going to participate on Monday anyway, and Sue hadn't planned on attending. Neither Rick nor Jim can attend.)  If there's a compelling reason that you think I should attend, let me know.  Otherwise I'll let Bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one.

Greetings Severin:

No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  

However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  

Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.

She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.

Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.

On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.  You and Sweeney did a great job.  What was your impression?  I've noticed that it got some decent press.

Best,
Jeff

It was good to see you.  No thanks needed.  I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.  How'd the meeting with PG&E go?  You get back to Houston OK?

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

BT 

I'll get back to you on teh plants as soon as I can.

Best,
Jeff

Meeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... 

Flights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... 

IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great.

Groovy.

Karen and I will handle stuff for pizza friday night, and most of dinner Saturday (thinking scallops and ???).  Will scallops work, Prentice?  If not, have a suggested alternate or something to add that you'd like?

Jeff can you bring breakfast stuff for both mornings and salad stuff for friday and saturday eve. 

We figure we can pick up saturday lunch items on saturday.... 

Cool???? 

what's the name of the borenstein consulting firm that you're applying too?

Professor:
Thanks for the response.  However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.  Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.  My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.  You'll note that this copy is dated "1031,"  whereas the previous copy was dated "1029."

Best,

Received. Thanks.

Best of luck.  Stay in touch.  You thinking of working in France?

Got the fax.

Thank you.

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I'm not positive.  The best way to find out is to call the Public Advisor at the PUC directly.  He'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers.  And I'm sure it's very easy to do.  I'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the Wednesday calls, though they've really wound down alot since the Legislature took off for vacation.  Hope all is well.
 
Best to you and yours,
Jeff

Jeff --
 
First of all, I wanted to thank you for your positive comments to Karen about my work on behalf of Enron.  She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  
 
I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!
 
I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.
 
How far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?
 
Any light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.
 
Thanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.  Since I'm basically on call, I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason.
 
Best,
Ken

Good plan.

I talked to Steve.. we won't respond, but I'm passing the letter along to Ben Glisan's team so they can follow up w/ Calpers.

I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do).

I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?

Jeff,

It was great to talk to you today.  Thank you so much for taking the time to
hear about our latest developments.  As I said earlier, we are very
interested in talking to your folks in the Net Works group at Enron.  The
pilot we are implementing for the Enron Energy Services group is going
extremely well.  We've been on site now for about two weeks and have pretty
much completed our user training sessions.  Everyone at Enron is very
pleased with the success of the project so far.  

I think the best thing would be to schedule a meeting for sometime in
mid-October.  That way, the Pilot Program will be completely implemented and
we will have more feedback on the use of our application.  How about the
week of October 15th?  Anytime that week will work with us and, as I told
you earlier, we are in Houston very frequently.

The people who would be a part of the discussion would be Ian Sullivan (who
heads up all implementation and professional services) and myself.

If anyone would like more information about Perfect Commerce prior to the
meeting I would be more than happy to send that over.  Just let me know.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

We need to start figuring out as soon as possible:
What we want to accomplish at the hearing.
What our posture/message will be.
What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond.
What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond.
How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference.
How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations)

Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.  Please let me know if this works for everyone.  Thanks a bunch.

Thanks.  That's why I was calling.  I'll continue to work to set up.  Any particular time, day, etc.?

You still interested in meeting with Edison's CFO?

Also, GWF is a QF developper from back in the days when QFs roamed the earth. Rather small player at that as best as we can tell.  

USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.
NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. 
But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. 
According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. 
"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. 
Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. 
The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. 
"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. 
CALIFORNIA CAVEAT 
Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . 
But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. 
"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. 
More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. 
Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. 
With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade.

Yesterday, we discussed that Edison is likely going to try to jerk around ESPs, QFs and generators on past due amounts under its settlement with the PUC.  Here's the latest on what they're doing to the QFs.

Best,
Jeff

I listed in on this afternoon's IEP call re: SCE's MOU.

According to Smutney-Jones (who was more than average mad), SCE has reneged on the "pay 10% up front" portion of the deal they struck with SCE.  According to IEP, SCE says that the banks, who are spooked by TURN's success in getting a 14-day temporary suspension of the CPUC-SCE settlement, is not interested in allowing SCE to pay any creditors like QFs preferentially. SCE said the 5.37 c/kWh commitment is still there, however.  IEP's was also unsuccessful in getting the effective date of 5.37 c/kWh changed in return for the loss of the 10% up front.

CCC/Jerry Bloom, who represents gas-fired QFs is seperately negotiating with SCE and may be willing to give up 10% in return for commiting to 5.37c/kwh outside of the CPUC.  (They are concerned with CPUC overturning the IEP-SCE "deal.")

Several parties on the call, including CalEnergy, indicated they may sue SCE outside the CPUC over reneging on this deal.

Alan Comnes

Overall looks great, though I made a few edits/comments.  But I couldn't figure out how to do it in strikeout/underline.  We should make it look as "PG&E-centric" as possible--you know how touchy IOUs are.

You and Dave and I should try to discuss in more detail early next week.

Best,
Jeff

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Ms Kahl:

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges."
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

Inquiring minds want to know.

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.

Best,
Jeff

Does it make sense to have a quick call (15-30 minutes) just to update you on the status of Edison/PG&E talks, what's going on at the PUC, etc.?  Let me know.  Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it.

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Could you forward Dan's draft.  While Aaron's points are good ones, I think may tipping at windmills...

 
Dan
 
Responses to your questions:
 
I think Enron would like to exclude the PX Credit issue from this case.  I am comfortable taking the lead from Enron on this issue and would support not advocating it be included in this case.  I think SCE is going to push for its inclusion, so Sue will need to provide you with some amunition on why it doesn't belong in this case before Wednesday.
 
On the second question, no.  I don't think we want to re-raise the rev req and tres letter leading to the end of DA.
 
I not sure we should push the bottoms up issue in this case.  It is not at all clear what the ALJ is trying to pull into the case with the reference to post px credits.  There is no pending matters on this, but for advice letters and protests.  We are much better fighting in that forum given the current decisions rather than getting some nasty decision from Barnett that messes up the victory we got in the rate increase decisions.
 
I strongly urge that we NOT push this into this proceeding.  It will be all downside.  Changes to the PE Credit (i.e. reductions) may end up here, but we should not be calling for it.
 
Lastly, how can we say that the commission doesn't have authority to implement exit fees without changes in law given prior filings of ARM that said they should implement a whole host of exit fees rather than end DA.  I don't think we can take this position without explaining the flip flop, which we certainly don't have room to do in the PHC statement.  Maybe we can get away with referencing other parties strong position on this and support the requirement of hearings if any such attempt is going to be made to establish exit fees.
 
Thanks
 
Aaron

Attached for your review and comment is a very rough first draft of the prehearing conference statement that we must bring to the hearing on Wednesday afternoon.  It outlines, with some substance, the issues you have indicated we want to bring up, it identifies a few questions and seeks guidance from AReM members.
 
Please review and get back to me with comments by the close of the day, if possible.  I am running to the airport (which is why this is not in as finished a form as versions normally sent to you) and will be looking for comments in my hotel room this evening.  
 
Also, do we want to invite WPTF to join with us again, as it did in the comments last Friday on the Wood Ruling?
 
thanks!

you'd think he'd go abroad on vacation or something until things cooled down, non?

grossed me out...

eeegads.  you heard about the story circulating that skilling attended a "high society" pajama party last weekend in houston. eeks.

Thanks, Jeanne.

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.

Greetings:
Any chance of changing my lesson from tomorrow to this Friday (preferably about lunchtime)?  Let me know.  If you're all booked for Friday, I'm likely going to have to skip this week.  Let me know.  Hope all is well.
 
Best,
Jeff

FYI.  I've talked to Jeanne, and she and Mike may have not completely communicated on this.  Given the uncertainty, I'm having to hold off on sending a note around.  I'll do one after the call.

Best,
Jeff

I have set up a conference call for this afternoon (11/6) at 3:30 p.m. PST
to discuss what Enron is going to say in its prehearing conference statement
tomorrow.   

Call in number = (800) 403-2024

Participant code = 257006

FYI.  Could be pretty explosive if evidence turns up confirming the market'=
s suspicions.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20

Thanks for the note.  Just let me know.  We'll do it when you're ready.  Between now and then, could you send me a summary (understanding that it's an estimate) of time and materials as you see them.  Thanks again.  Good luck with the other jobs.  Talk to you soon.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

We're still here, just to let you know.

Have been working on a small project which has evolved into something
quite larger as the owners keep adding more. We still plan on doing your
project, but I can't leave the current one until finished.

I will stay in touch.

Best Wishes,

Jim Docker

Great.  Can you give me the entire list (indicating who's who)?  I'm thinking that if I let the big customers know, perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on.

Tricon -- another Enron customer -- agreed to sign on to the SUpreme Court Appeal

Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.

Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).
But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.

Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.

Best,
Jeff

In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Per our conversation, I am trying to put together some data on the status of gas markets in California, Nevada, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Oregon.  In particular I need the gas market characteristics in these states.  Are the markets open to retail competition for commercial and industrial customers and if so, what are the requirements and are there some limitations.  Please E-mail me your response as I will be in Long Beach tomorrow.

Thanks.

What came of the call?

Latest agreement ...
Attached is the SCE proposed amendment to implement the renewable/QF
agreement.  IEP will be discussing this document during the conference call
tomorrow (Tuesday) at 2:30 p.m. (PST).  Please review the document and be
prepared to discuss and comment on the specifics.

Further, note the cover memo from SCE which speaks to the need to keep this
document confidential.  Please adher to the SCE's request and the
commitments made by the parties to the discussions.  Thanks.

     Gentlemen:

     Attached please find a draft of Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement
Addressing Renewable Energy Pricing and Payment Issues.  As agreed by all
at our meeting on October 17, our ongoing discussions concerning the
subject matter of this draft are confidential, and may not be used for any
purpose in any judicial proceeding or otherwise as evidence.  Furthermore,
all present agreed that the discussions, and by extension this draft
Amendment, are to be held in confidence by you accept as is reasonably
necessary to communicate with other members of the QF community that you
represent.  We appreciate your explaining this restriction to such parties.
     Thank you for your patience.  Please respond with any comments to Lars
Bergmann with a copy to me and Russ Swartz.

You get in to see Whalley?

Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier.

you get in to see whalley?

i talked to david fleisig at pg&e last night. he begged for simple term sheet that could be flushed out in definitive documentation.
would you add the following for people to comment on in the term sheet:
we will oppose the assessment of an underscheduling penalty at the ferc.
they will oppose the assessment of any surcharge to da customers by the cpuc for any of their undercollections.
we will both cooperate to either get ferc alj approval of the settlement or if we waive this requirement in our discretion (e.g. if some holdup there/we want to close fast), they will immediately pay to us any refund that we end up paying that goes to them.

You're kidding, right?  Edison's at about 14.50.

By the end of the week, our share price may be lower than Edison's.  

Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier.

great.  good luck with others.

When do you want to call Hedy and Bev?

$18.10/share.  don't make me give suggestions.

o.k PG&E.  

You're kidding, right?  Edison's at about 14.50.

By the end of the week, our share price may be lower than Edison's.  

Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier.

aye aye.

This morning.  If I don't give you a call by 11:30, call me.  

When do you want to call Hedy and Bev?

thanks.  I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.  You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?  And that Buffet ain't interested?  What a world.

Someone in real estate finance I know compared what Fastow & Co. did to the FirstPlus fiasco.  That hurt.

Best,
Jeff

Lisa and I met with him at 9am.  Three minutes into it he looked up and asked "can I reschedule?" and then asked us to have Lavorato or Kitchen decide. Rather surreal.    We are on for Louise at 1pm cst.    Will let you know.

PS ran into one the corporate development folks in the elevator.   This person said to is "hump day" for a deal.

You get in to see Whalley?

Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.  

After the PHC today, we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for.  Sue, can you make sure that Jeremy and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps.

Thanks.

thanks.  this is really important to the restructures we are working on.

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

Sue

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

No problem.  To be honest, I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally.  Please let me know if I do/did.  Also, keep in touch with how the issues go with them, since they are clearly trying to use the reg. issues as leverage, and in that regard, often offering up worst-case scenarios.

Best,
Jeff

I'll get back to you today.  Houston is dealing with some pretty big issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.  How's the weather in the big apple?  You vote for Green or Bloomberg?

Do you have any more info about the meeting on the 13th.  It looks like mid morning would be a good time (if the meeting is still going to happen).  I obviously understand if you have bigger issues to deal with, but I have to arrange plane flights for myself and Marc if necessary.

I hope things are going well.

Jesus, 93 million Enron shares have traded thus far today.  Insane.  

   FYI. 

 

Brad:  Lot of water under the bridge since the 25th, but I just got a note from Perfect.  They're still planning on being in Houston to meet on the afternoon of the 13th.  Let me know if anything's changed and I'll get you the information on Perfect ASAP.  Thanks.

The 13th would work much better, preferably in the afternoon.  Please contact Lydia Cannon (713-853-4893) to get a specific time on my calendar.  Also, any specific Perfect company information beforehand would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brad

How do the 13th or 20th of November work?

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff

No problem.  I'll let them know.

I plan (at this point) to be in New York until the morning of the 14th.  Maybe we need to stretch out this meeting while the company catches its wind.

Hey:
Just heard back from Brad.  He's not cancelling.  Just post-poning.  Lots--and I mean lots--going on.  I think that, realistically, we're talking December.  Sorry about that, but you know how quickly things can change....You guys hang out with the McCourey's at all?

Kisses,
Jeff

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.
From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

interesting to say the least.  great case for b-school.  you still in texas?

Ineteresting times at Enron.  Hang in there... 

No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff

I am reading an article in NGI that talks about how California Regulator's are scheduled to approve some form of unbundling on Socal's system.  Please provide details of this as soon as it happens.  Thank you.

Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Hello lawyers,

Attached is a draft of an appeal to the Sup Ct. of the CPUC's decision
to suspend DA.  The authors would like review and comment and to
consider joining the petition. Comments back to Jeff Dasovich asap, they
want to file by Nov 9.

Dot

You bet.

Thank you.  Just let me know if it changes.

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

FYI.  Indicates where CMTA is on key bills working their way through California's wacked out Legislature.
 
Best,

Legislative Weekly 
September 6, 2001 
Issue 35, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

ELECTRICAL RESTRUCTURING 

SBX2 78 (Polanco D-Los Angeles and Sher D-Stanford).  CMTA supports this bill to allow Southern California Edison to collect $2.9 billion from customers to cover excess power costs incurred between May 2000 and January 2001.  While the debt can only be assessed against customers over 20kw in demand, provisions protecting the right to direct access and customer generation overcome our objections to the disproportionate spread of debt. The bill will be on the assembly floor this week. 

SBX2 27 (Bowen D-Marina del Rey).  This direct access bill remains a potential vehicle for reinstatement of direct access if SBX2 78 fails.  It failed to gain 2/3 votes in the Senate last June. CMTA did not support the bill, but remains willing to work with the author. 

SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco).  CMTA supports this bill to create a separate revenue stream for payment of state energy revenue bonds, saving financing costs and simplifying the relationship between bonds and Department of Water Resources power contracts.  Passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability. 

SBX2 85 (Burton).  CMTA opposes this bill to repeal the sunset on the 10% rate discount for small commercial and residential customers that was created by AB 1890.  It passed out of Assembly EC&A. 
  

NATURAL GAS EXIT FEES 

ABX2 23 (Pescetti R-Rancho Cordova) requires non-core customers to make long-term projections regarding their firm service gas delivery needs, and would allow utilities to impose exit fees on non-core customers that do not later desire that firm service level. 

CMTA is opposed unless exit fees are removed. CMTA supports amendments to simply require the PUC to study the state's natural gas infrastructure to determine ways in which to expand capacity and increase competition.  The bill has not yet been set for hearing in Senate Energy Utilities and Communications. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - EMINENT DOMAIN 

ABX2 35 (Vargas D-San Diego) authorizes the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority to exercise eminent domain to acquire generating facilities for 18-24 months.  Generators would be reimbursed a "reasonable rental value" as opposed to "fair market value" for facilities temporarily taken by the State.  Co-generation facilities are not exempt from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed and the bill may not move.  It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality. The bill is currently in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - STRICT LIABILITY 

ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno) provides that a resale or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility that reduces or discontinues service for solely economic reasons shall be held strictly liable for any damages proximately caused by that reduction or discontinuance.  "Economic reasons" is defined as the withholding of power for financial gain. Cogeneration is exempted from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed.  According to the author's staff, the measure will not be moved. The bill is in Assembly EC&A Committee. 
  

ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS - ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES 

Despite rigorous debate on the Assembly Floor, on September 4 the Assembly adopted amendments to ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) which make the bill less onerous.  As amended, the measure makes it a wobbler for any person or entity, whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity, to exercise market power.  Market power is defined as the profitable maintenance of wholesale electricity prices above the prices that would occur in the wholesale market if that market were competitive.  The measure also allows the imposition of a fine of up to 10 percent of the violator's gross assets, upon conviction.  Felony penalties would apply to any person or entity that exercised market power during a Stage 1, 2 or 3 electrical emergency as determined by the Independent System Operator. 

The September 4 amendments limit the bill to apply only to entities whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity that are able to exercise market power, and technically exempt qualifying facilities, co-generation, or self-generation.  The measure still includes onerous bounty-hunter provisions that authorize the Attorney General to pay a reward to any person who provides information that materially contributes to the imposition of a criminal fine.  The reward would be equal to 10% of the amount of the criminal fine collected by the AG, district attorney, or imposed by the court.  The measure likely will be taken up for a vote on the Assembly Floor sometime this week. 
  

TAX - TRIAL DE NOVO 

AB 934 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys).  CMTA supports reforms to the property tax assessment appeal process, granting courts more power to overturn decisions that are anti-taxpayer. Assessors and counties claim that they will be manipulated into settling disputes too cheaply.  They obtained a Leg Counsel opinion declaring it to violate the California Constitution. 

The bill is in Senate Rules.  CMTA is lobbying to ensure that it is sent to Appropriations and are lobbying members of that committee as well as members whose votes will be needed on the floor.  There is speculation that it is being held in Rules for leverage for a larger deal but it is more probable that it is a tactic to delay it until Hertzberg, the author, is no longer Speaker. 
  

CORPORATE COUNSEL - PROTECTIVE ORDER/CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS 

AB 36 (Steinberg D-Sacramento), SB 11 (Escutia D-Whittier), AB 881 (Simitian D-Palo Alto).  CMTA opposes these bills to potentially expose proprietary information to the public.  SB 11 and AB 36 drive up litigation costs for defendants, leveraging higher settlements. AB 36 was "Speakerized" with the proviso that its substance would not go to the Governor, that SB 11 would be "the vehicle" and be revised into a more business friendly version.  Nevertheless, AB 36 (unchanged) has received a rule waiver allowing it to move in the Senate. 

CMTA is working on keeping the moderate Democrats in the Assembly from passing SB 11 and, if AB 36 does go to the Governor, in having them help with obtaining a veto.  CMTA is proposing AB 881 as an alternative though it is preferred that it not pass, and the trial lawyers would likely kill it.  At this point it appears that the moderates will stay with us but it appeared that way just before they caved-in in June. 
  

EDUCATION - CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 

AB 348 (Wright D-So. Central Los Angeles).  Several "voc-ed" bills designed to bolster this ailing system were passed by the Legislature this year including AB 348 which introduces mechanisms to elevate the academic standing of such courses.  Unfortunately, much of the funding for the voc-ed bills was cut out of the Budget. 
  

EDUCATION - FACILITIES BOND 

AB 16 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys/Leonard R-San Bernardino) and SB 844 (Chesbro D-Arcata).  CMTA has declared support for this legislation to place a statewide school facilities bond on the ballot in 2002. Their scope spans K-College.  A conference committee is addressing the timing for the ballot (March vs. November), the amount and the allocation between K-12 and higher ed., and the allocation system to use among schools. 
  

HOUSING 

CMTA supports two bills: AB 1284 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) which provides property tax rewards to local jurisdictions within specified job centers (basically all of the major urban areas) which approve and build housing affordable to the local workforce.  SB 910 (Dunn D-Santa Ana) would impose sanctions on local jurisdictions which chronically fail to plan for their housing needs.  Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects.  Their terms will be negotiated during the interim. 
  

$3.6 BILLION WORKERS' COMPENSATION BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK 

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers' compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers $3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a negotiating mood. 

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a $1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB 71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers' costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or someone else. 

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the governor's point person on workers' compensation said, "the governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is comfortable with."  Smith dismissed the threat of labor turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else. 

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at <http://www.cmta.net/press/082301work_comp.shtml> 
  

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 

SB 40 (Alarcon D-Sylmar) would increase unemployment insurance (UI) cost by over $3 billion over four years and includes several other onerous changes for employers.  The bill is in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on the suspense file and is opposed by CMTA. 

Unlike workers' compensation, UI has only two active parties of interest, labor and employers.  CMTA believes that employers are more vulnerable to a benefit increase in UI than workers' compensation because our maximum benefit level is the second lowest of all the states.  Therefore, employer representatives from CMTA, Cal-Chamber, Cal-Tax and Newspaper Publishers Association met with the author and labor to discuss a benefit increase and reforms to help offset some costs. The coalition has put together a proposal to counter SB 40. 

CMTA does not believe that the Governor would sign two benefit bills in the same year unless they were both negotiated and agreed upon by both labor and management.  According to the latest news, the Governor asked labor to choose and labor decided on the workers' compensation bill this session.  Therefore, no further action on UI will be taken this session. 
  

STORMWATER 

SB 72's author, Senator Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), and the bill sponsor, Santa-Monica-based Heal The Bay, agreed to remove all of the controversial minimum stormwater monitoring requirements affecting industrial facilities.  Most notably, the August 21 version deletes the proposed increase in stormwater sampling frequency and language requiring inclusion of additional constituents in each sampling event.  The current version also deletes all references to group monitoring - a regulatory program designed to streamline monitoring requirements for similar industrial facilities - which was originally prohibited.  These changes will spare individual facilities from thousands of dollars in increased stormwater monitoring costs.  All opposition has been removed, and the amendments lower the state's anticipated costs substantially.  The next hurdle is the state water board's renewal of the General Industrial Stormwater Permit next year. 
  

SAFE DRINKING WATER & TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT 

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65), SB 471 (Sher), was amended on July 5 to incorporate language developed by the Attorney General's office.  It is intended to help curb frivolous litigation, invited by lucrative bounty hunter provisions, that has overwhelmed the AG's resources.  Although advertised as a pro-business reform measure, the AG's proposal undermined the certainty of Prop. 65 settlements by allowing a district attorney, city attorney or private prosecutor to sue again for the same alleged offense.  The AG and Senator Sher have since agreed to remove that provision and make other lesser changes to avoid opposition from the business community.  The bill requires a 2/3 vote, which may not be achievable without a commitment from the AG to pursue further discussions toward more substantive reform. 
  

2002 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FORECAST 

Water Quality Standards - SB 469 (Alpert D-Coronado).  Held up in end of session politics, the bill advances consensus recommendations to improve regional implementation of federal Total Maximum Daily Load program.  Requires state water board to develop guidelines for regional boards on listing and de-listing water bodies and implementing TMDLs.  Would help focus state resources on legitimate water quality problems.  May move as urgency legislation in January, 2002. 

Wastewater Discharge Offset Program - SB 815 (Machado D-Linden). Two-year vehicle to address the affects of legacy sources of pollution (e.g., abandoned mines) without bankrupting the discharger community.  Would provide less costly alternatives to end-of-the pipe permit limits, such as investing in upstream cleanup projects, with greater environmental benefits. 

Environmental Justice.  Under pressure from environmental activists, CARB is pursuing an aggressive agenda that does not track legislative direction.  Staff will present draft guidelines to the Board in December.  CARB's work will serve as a model for other Cal-EPA agencies required by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000) to review their programs to address environmental justice concerns. 

Toxic Injuries - SB 693 (Scott D-Altadena).  Two-year measure sponsored by trial lawyers to extend the statute of limitations for filing injury claims related to hazardous material exposures.  Anticipate an oppose position. 

Brownfields Cleanup Incentives - AB 1114 (Pescetti).  Stalled this year due to politics surrounding Senator Escutia's local agency enforcement-based program in SB 32.  AB 1114 seeks flexible, risk-based cleanup standards, innocent operator liability relief and modest financial incentives for parties seeking to voluntarily initiate cleanup and redevelopment.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. 

The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.
If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority.
If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.

I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.

Best,
Jeff

Hey, buddie.  Mike and Sue still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.)

Best,
Jeff

They're yours.  Just let me know as soon as you can if you'd like them.  Hope you're doing well.  Stay buckled up.  It's bumpy out there.  But at least they're starting to publicly clean house.

Best,
Jeff

I'm interested.

Checkout the great deal, 49er fans!

April:  Could you please distribute this to the office?  Thanks a bunch.

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Best,
Jeff

Haven't seen any DA statements yet.

So where is his great statement on DA?  IS that a tar baby now?

As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison.
Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

If anyone has any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.  Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.  Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.  And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Talk to you soon.  Keep hanging in there.

Best,
Jeff 	

No.  what do they do?

Ever heard of an East Bay company called Edgewood Creek?

 

Hello All -- With all the uncertainty this has been a difficult project to concentrate on, however, here is a first stab at establishing criteria for evaluating the prospects for retail service state-by-state, and by major LDC.  Some of these criteria may be consolidated or eliminated as the matrix progresses.  I have differentiated between transportation (C&I customers can receive distribution service separate from commodity) as opposed to Customer Choice whereby C&I and Residential customers may have alternative service choices.  PLEASE LOOK OVER THE MATRIX  with an eye towards changes.  Nothing is set in stone and the simpler and more relevant we make it the better the product.  Thanks all.

 

great time.  SO sorry I passed out.  Man, I just suddently hit the wall.

On the Jay thing.  There's no pressure at all.  If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.  Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.  Most importantly in the near term.  Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?  Just let me know.  And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.  Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc.  Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.

Keep your taht moh rising.

FYI.

what's pepcid.  he has NO idea.  is he sure it ain't something fatal?  poor annie.

doc did not keep her.  said to give her pepcid and a bland diet but not to
start for 24 hours.  took blood but so far has no idea what it is.  doesn't
think she was poisoned.  she's lost 10 pounds in the last year.  (but I
think she's lost most of that in the last couple weeks)

EES is fully on board with these pursuits...
?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Josh:
Sorry to bother you.  But just wanted to be certain.  By my tally, I only need to take 3 units next semester (spring) to graduate (I'm taking 7 units this semester). Is there anyway to get that "officially" verified through the office?  Thanks much.

Best,
Jeff

Well, that's not helpful. Won't make things any easier.  Are they an ARM member?

I'll let the large customer groups know.

New West has indeed adopted SCE's position hook-line-and-sinker.  I left Janie a very pointed e-mail on this topic.  They have no customers receiving commodity from them, so, I guess, in the short term, they are not harmed.  It is, noehteless, an unprincipled position.  A key quote from the filing:

"It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."

(See attached file: Document1.doc)

Greetings.  I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.  Let me know.  Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.

Rick:

With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.

I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).

Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  

I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

Best,
Jeff

PS Given DYN and ENE share prices today, looks like the market loves the combination.  That's pretty nice.  (Wouldn't know it by what Rebecca Smith keeps writing, though.  Gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame.)

 FYI.  Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.  Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads:

"It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."

Obviously, not a helpful statement.  New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.

Best,
Jeff

 

 

Hi.  Could you re-email the ARM press release re: supreme court?  I want to distribute it around a bit.  Thanks.

FYI.  I notified the large customers and it appears they've taken it upon themselves to notify some of New West's customers of New West's new, "supplemental" position.

You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?

They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.  You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?  Some people you just can't get rid of....

Best,
Jeff

I'm assuming that these are the sorts of things we should hold off on?

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=

This is very sad.  Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.  I love Annie and want to remember her the way she is.  And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for Annie, and everyone else, is for Annie to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.  I hope you understand.  I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.

We need to have a conference call all together tonight to discuss how to
move forward with Annie.  She has cancer and without treatment would
probably live only a few weeks.  Chemotherapy could prolong her life
reasonably comfortably from 6 months to a year.  The minimum cost would be
about $1,500.  I think it would be best if we all got on the phone together
around 6 - does that work for all of you??

submit it now - thanks.

You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?

They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.  You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?  Some people you just can't get rid of....

do you have rory's email address?

Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you explain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  Rory has some ideas.
 
Best,

Thought I'd add Eldon, too, since he likely has some ideas and information, too.

Yes. Hadn't planned on going.

Have you received an invitation to attend a reception in LA for the Canadian Prime Minister on Thursday, November 29?  Is anyone going?

talked to roger again.  give me a call when you get a chance.

Best,

Thank you. Will there be a call-in number?  And who else do we expect on the call?

	Call will be at 3:00 pm Houston time

	Left message for Jan that this time is ok.  Got voice mail, left message, should hear back from him to confirm.

i'm here. 415.782.7822. jeff

Will do.  Won't have it expand beyond that, unless Belden, Vicki or Janet specifically want someone else.

Best,

Yes.

Rick:
We need to add Janet on the call with Belden and Vicki?

EES is fully on board with these pursuits...
?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Hi Jeff - Here's the deal, I've had a cold for a few days. I'm probably past the contagious stage but this is not an exact science. I'm up for teaching today but I figure it's fair to let people know in case they're concerned. I'll see you at 4:30 unless I hear from you in which case I'll understand. Hey, thanks for facilitating this little DAW discussion group. I think I understand the procedure now. I had to hunt around a little for the "reply to all" command(not on my tool bar), but I found it. Now I'm ready. I'm still learning about a lot of this stuff. Later - Avram

Who loves ya baby?

Hey, don't say anything to Karen, or her parents, but I'd like to get something for her parents as a thank you for Gloucester.  What sorts of things do they like?

You heard that Prentice got a job offer from Price Waterhouse?!

See you on Friday!

Thanks again for the stuff.  I can take it from here.  Two quick questions.
1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about?
2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?

Thanks again.  I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.

Revised Slide 7 included in this set.

Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
Jeff

Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.

The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.

Jeff

Greetings:
Left you a voicemail over the weekend.  Was traveling Thurs/Fri, but got a chance to look at your reorg memo, and listened in on the call on Friday.  I've got a few questions.  You have 15-20 minutes today to discuss a bit?  Greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

when you intend to make counter to PG&E?  10Q out yet?

Ken Lay called Rick Buy and I up to his office talk about settlement just now.   He would like to settle for liquidity/good news.   Rick Buy is going to discuss with Whalley.

	
Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5

If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Can we talk this week on our response?

Jim

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.

7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

If you have any questions, please call

Jeanne        

Not all, but some.  I'll give you a ring to discuss more.

Just confirming that we (ENA) aren't planning to use all of our "chits" on this issue..

Please call if you have any questions.

I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and got an update of discussions with PG&E.  He received an email yesterday from Dan Richards (Steve Kean equivalent at PG&E) and he is getting a contact for us to interface with at PG&E on this issue.  Dan indicated that he would try and have a name and number to Jeff by early next week, so Jeff will keep us posted.  If you have any questions, comments, etc. give me a call and I'll track it down.

FYI, in case you haven't see this yet:

PLAYING AN 'UNUSUAL' ROLE, LANGDON PICKS THROUGH EL PASO RECORD
Handed the unusual task of independently assessing the strength of El Paso Corp.'s defense in the
California capacity complaint case, Washington attorney Jim Langdon for weeks has been searching for
relevant issues that may have been ignored or overlooked by the litigants. And he thinks he may have
stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the
critical months of the California energy crisis.
What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case (RP00-241), the California Public Utilities
Commission, may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during
the months of the controversial large-volume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co. and
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co.
Langdon, a partner in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, in late July was
hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the
record in the case (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The idea was "not to second-guess the lawyers litigating the case," but
rather to "think dispassionately about the events of last year" and give Wise "an independent view" of the
behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to
California, Langdon explained last week.
Wise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice,
Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told
Inside FERC, acknowledging "this really was a little bit of an unusual request."
Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions.
He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as
a FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser.
Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition
and the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate
decision in this case?
That possibility "didn't escape me" at the time, Langdon admitted. "I'll not pretend to be unaware
that there are these other connections with Wood and the president," he allowed, adding that "that's
something that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law." And, "for the
record, I barely know Pat Wood."
And how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for
Langdon's services? "I recognize that there are critics and cynics" who would suggest that Langdon is
simply a hired gun, "but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind" the report. He vowed to
"call it the way I see it."
His final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial
thoughts and findings.
Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern
California Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County
and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El
Paso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large
volumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests
in June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related.
Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso
Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000
Dt/day of deliverability to the California gas market "without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity,"
said Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that
"storage is huge" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, "storage is a way to
take care of . . . these problems."
And yet, the SoCal Gas applications "clearly languished" at the CPUC. "There may be very good reasons"
why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far "I don't understand how the CPUC
sits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is."
For its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state
border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its
feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). "I'm trying not to sound like an
advocate in this thing," said Langdon, but "I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when
right in their own back yard they've got these storage issues."
As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the
contract and subsequently "withheld massive amounts of capacity" from the market, "we've reached the
conclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented" so far in the proceeding, said
Langdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at "the maze of engineering issues" that could hold the
answer to the capacity withholding issue.
Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations
colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving
energy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted.
In most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the
gas industry has "been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the
very same ones" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. "They absolutely need to
be updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph," said Langdon.
Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about
the strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was "not at all concerned about the company not
getting a fair shake" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say "has been sensationalized to
a degree" in the press, he said, adding that "what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are
two different things."
Langdon admitted that he would be "a little concerned" about Wagner's remarks "if I were litigating
the case." The judge has used some "pretty strong language" to suggest that the El Paso companies were
out of line. But FERC "historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal," and "in this case, the record
looks very sound," he said. - Chris Newkumet

thanks.

I like it for 2 reasons:
 
1.    The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.
 
2.    If we got this "gift", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.
 
Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.

You guys interested?

Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would
grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using
reclaimed water.  The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have
been worked out.  His office would like to know if Enron would be interested
in providing technical assistance with the measure.  They approached Enron
because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its
air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.

Thoughts?

I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it, but I may have it all wrong.  In any case, please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the DA suspension.  Community Aggregation would not be allowed after Sept 20th.  Is anything you care about and/or have a position on?  Thanks very much. Hope you're well.

Best,
Jeff

  

No problem.  Give me a little time and I'll get you some names.  What's your timeframe?  (Probably yesterday, right?)

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

Hope you are doing well. Got your email from Scott. I'm hoping you can
do me a favor.  We are doing a  research project for a client and are
trying to identify key technical management at a variety of companies,
including Enron.

Specifically, we are looking for names and addresses of the following:

CIO/CTO
VP, Directors and/or Sr. Managers responsible for the company's
network.  They'll typically have titles like VP of Network Operations
and Senior Network Architect.

Any chance you can get me this info for Enron? I'd be forever in your
debt.

thanks,

 kent

Sorry.  Was covering a meeting up the street.  Got your message.  I'm back.  You know there are rumors flying around about you in London?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:
Just wanted to check in to let you know that I've taken another step in getting meetings with the GM of both Anaheim and SMUD.  Will let you know.  Ain't moving at a lightening pace, but there's progress.

Best,
Jeff

Jeanne:  Do you have a copy of the procurement OIR?  Could you email it to me if you do? Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.     

Jeanne Bennett     

It's more complicated still.  A crazy commissioner at the CPUC now wants to require everyone to submit their DA contracts to Commission for review.  It's attached.  Folks are going to oppose it very strongly.  I'm available to talk.  I'm not sure that the Oct. 5th date has got legs.
 
Best,
Jeff

Guys please see the email from Hanson below.
 
Dave would like to talk about this tomorrow morning say 10:00 am PST, please let me know if you can't make it.  
 
Jeff, can you provide us with an update on items 1 and 2.
 
Harlan and Chris, obviously we will be focusing on Hanson's request for compensation for "delayed opportunity to participate in Direct Access".  I have also attached a time line of events surrounding this agreement and the DASR.  
 
Cheers
 
Victor Browner 
Dear Victor and David: 

Please review the CPUC attachments provided by CLECA's Dr. Barbara Barkovich. The CPUC is aggressively following up on Direct Access contracts and DASR's. Please let us know where you are in responding to the CPUC Direct Access Verification process as it relates to Hanson Permanente's contract with Enron, as follows:

1. Have you been contacted by the CPUC or PG&E related to the Direct Access verification process? 
2. What information have you provided to the CPUC and to any other requesting party? 

We look forward to hearing from you ASAP on answers to these questions.  We would also appreciate copies of any correspondence that you have had with anyone on the DASR and Direct Access Contract. 

The DASR process was handled very poorly by Enron in September, and those errors delayed Hanson Permanente's opportunity to participate in Direct Access until November. We are awaiting Enron's remedy to compensate Hanson for the added power cost incurred during October 2001.

Please call me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Earl

For those of you who have gone DA, did all of your ESPs send your names 
to the utilities by Oct. 5?  Here is the utility filing on DA suspension implementation and that is an important date.  I want to be sure that we don't have any problems along those lines.

I am including copies of the utility filings for those of you who want to learn more about this and why the date is important.  We need to file comments on the utility filings by Nov. 28. Barbara

My apologies for the delay.  About three other bonfires cropped up after I talked to you.  In any case, the answer to your question, is yes, we can switch our customers to dual billing if we choose to do so.  If you have any other questions, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

You're a helluva guy.  I'm damned proud to be associated with you, and hope=
 to continue in the future.  If we don't get a chance to talk between now a=
nd tomorrow, have a great Thanksgiving.  And Rick, I'm not a very religious=
 guy, but god bless you.

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to Californ=
ia.  In that memo, I included a quote that went as follows ? "What we do in=
 life echoes through eternity".  I think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to Enron, of the last few months.  I do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but I do know that what we've=
 done here at Enron in Government Affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in Houston, Washington, London, Brussels, Sao Paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  We even had a=
 good time doing it.  The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

Regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  My personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  Irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, I will continue to do all I can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

On a more holiday-related note, for those in the U.S., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on Wednesday in advan=
ce of Thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  For tho=
se not celebrating the American Thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E=
SPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commissio=
n by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who =
sign a "suitable" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow=
:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=
ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=
t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=
l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=
nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =
to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be consi=
dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=
nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =
contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Doc=
ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.<?xm=
l:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /=
>

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=
xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=
ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =
submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=
ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order=
 and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =
staff by December 11, 2001.=20

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=
e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=
nuary 4, 2002.

As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=
s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF=
 are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they=
 wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this=
 Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =
options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=
ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=
ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=
rly outrageous because of the statements that, "A failure to submit this in=
formation for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of=
 the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=
" and "Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=
reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=
s are in effect."  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=
ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=
s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=
ent customers. =20
=20
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=
ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=
RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=
rnor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be very=
 much appreciated.

EES is fully on board with these pursuits...
?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

Best,
Jeff

Very yummy dinner.  So light.  So fluffy.  Your friend Renee is very nice. Thanks.

dude:  you guys won first (even after those bad picks you made).  Congratz.

don't look over your shoulder, cuz we're right on your heels!

So sorry to hear about your nose.  How bad is it? Swollen?  Your eyes OK?  Expected to heal quickly?

Greetings Dan:  Few things.

Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them.
Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers?
Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
Jeff

wouldn't miss it.  how's lil' annie doing?

I certainly understand your anxiousness to get up to the dome for shrooms,

Hi.  I read Karl's ruling on the contracts.  Just about had it with that bozo.  I'm assuming that the customers are going to resist? 
 
 

Hey man, you feeling any better?

what would you like me to bring and/or do for Friday?

Hello:

First, forget it all and have a wonderful holiday.

Second, given the immense challenges, I've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid.  So I sent to Rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school.  Do you know if he got it?

Best,
Jeff

Thanks very much.  If possible, I'd like to listen in.  That possible? And have a very nice holiday.

Steve:

Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.

On the plus side:
He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.
He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.
His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.

On the negative side: 
In each and every case that Rod has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first.
Here are three examples (and there are more):  
1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a "stranded cost charge" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill.
2)	In the "alternative MOU" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison.
3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.

Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.  

Best,
Jeff

FYI.
You may recall that the last summary included SCE advice letter 1586-E.  This was the advice filing that seeksto implement a number of the regulatory components included in the October 2, 2001 Settlement Agreement between the CPUC and SCE.  The summary noted that Edison asked for comments to be due on November 28.  That request has been denied (see the attached letter), and comments are instead due on December 4.
 
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

Geoff Pollard is the SM for Pac Tel.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Jim

Thanks very much.

Yes, I will keep you all posted.  I placed a call to the customer at 7:30 this morning, but have not heard back from them yet.

Thanks so much for the call back.  Here it is.  It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.  Couple of things.  I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.  I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.  If not, let me know. 

Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).  Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.  

If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.  Really appreciate all your help.  My number is 415.782.7822.

Can you forward me both?  I'll take a look at them. Maybe they'll do the trick.  Also, do you have that press article where we partnered with a muni (in Canada, I think)?

Hi Jeff...I have an intro letter, and the presentation that we typically give on our first visit.  Do you think one of those might be appropriate, or shall I put together something in between the two?

Greetings Ms Denne:
Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing.  A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about Enron partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.  Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?  I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!  Greatly appreciated.

Janelle:
Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to Marcie.  Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Marcie:

	Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  Elena tells me that you're having a great time.

	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  

	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.

Here are some of the program's highlights:

Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.

Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. 

Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities

Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.

Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.

Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. 

	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.

All the best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff:

I'm not sure if hiring is an issue these days for you, but I wanted to let
you know that Jim Bushnell and I will be again teaching a course at
Berkeley this spring called "Energy Market Strategies and Policies."  The
course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy
& Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley.

The course is currently limited to 42 students, but it is already
over-subscribed, so we are trying to move it to a larger classroom. We'll
have mostly MBA students from Haas, but also about a dozen masters
students from ERG. There are also usually at least a few PhD students.
The students in the class are were very smart -- many of them
already have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the
course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any
energy-related organization that they would join.  You can see a copy of
last year's course syllabus at
 http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste/EnergyMarketsSyllabus.pdf

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May.  If you have openings that you would
like to advertise to these students, please let me know.  We will be
setting up a webpage with job announcements in energy-related
organizations.  If you send me a job description (or the URL for it), I
can add it to the webpage.

Talk to you soon,
Severin

	please review this one.  i just read the contract and there is no end date.  it's open-ended and simply says that we can end at our discretion.
 

Thanks very much for getting the contracts for me.  Please address one each to Bev and Hedy on our letter head so I can sign and send out today.  Thanks a bunch.

 

Scott:
Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).  You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler.
Best,
Jeff

The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 
The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. 
The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). 
The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. 
The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. 
The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. 
The Decision's purported findings are not supported. 
The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.

Best,
Jeff

No problem.

Jeff,

Thanks for the update...

Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?

Best,
Jeff

All,

Unfortunately, Aaron and I will not be able to make this call.  However, we
wanted to let the group know that we are strongly opposed to New West's
proposal and urge the group to adopt the position we agreed to during last
week's call, i.e., oppose the UDCs' proposal for a DASR cut-off date, for
the reasons outlined in Dan's most recent draft.

Thanks.

Bill
925.287.4703

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.  
 <<arm-puc-plan.doc>> 
Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation

Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

Geoff

Thanks, Lamar.  Geoff, could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end.  Thanks very much.

Geoff Pollard is the SM for Pac Tel.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Jim

Will do.  Thanks again for getting to the bottom of it.

Let me know if I should contact anyone.

Hey, just checking in to see if you're still out there.  What a story.  Hope you weathering things ok.

Best,

Greetings.  Well, it's about over for the company known as Enron.  Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.  But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive.  It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.  But it is what it is.  As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around. I've already had a few calls from "inquiring minds," so we'll we where things end up.  Thanks so much for the thoughts. Definitely crazy times, but I'm not getting to worked up about it.  And besides, Prentice has accepted PWC's offer, so I'm looking forward to housekeeping!

Jeff

Well, I think that Enron's fate is going to affect everyone, including me. But no worries, I'll land on my feet.  Love to have tea, just let me know when.  How you doing?

Hey, what's going on?  I'm reading terrible things about Enron - is it affecting you?  Let me know how you are and if you can meet for tea.  
 
G.

You're a good man.  Thanks.  You may regret having offered, though, since there's an extremely good chance that I'm likely to take you up on it.

Jeff - Given all the things Enron is going through, if there is anything I
can do,  just let me know.

OK, now I'm getting choked up.  Thanks, man.

I just sent a note to Dan reminding him that with the debacle going on in
Houston, we should consider a home for you here at PG&E. Not sure if
anything will come of it, but I'll let you know.  He always gets back to me.

FYI.  Thank you both very much for your help on this.

hand, prentice and i have worked things out.  as part of the divorce
settlement, i get the fresia, and weekend visiting rights to the

the other half going to mine.  we're still negotiating about placing
the wheel barrow in a blind trust.

hope your meeting went well.

shoot me a draft of the withdrawal before you send it in so i can say that i reviewed prior to submission.  thanks.

 how much all of us have given to this place, some for many years.  I have =
been searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a =
book the other day about Teddy Roosevelt, former President of the United St=

"the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives =

himself in worthy causes.  Who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievem=

place shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither vict=

The work that we did here was great.  The way we did it, I believe, sets an=

e do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were abl=

 around the world over the next months and years.  I hope to speak to many,=

Thank you

should i stop working?  no big deal, really.  but don't want to continue, if it doesn't make sense.  thanks, jeff

Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.  You know that I've really come to love that crazy dog, and it meant a lot that you and Eldon were always so caring.  She is truly a lovely dog and I'll miss her immensely, but it helps that everyone was so loving.  And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off. Thanks again so much for everything.

Hugs,
Jeff

Oops.  Yeah, Aleck.  Too bad.  Talked to Sue. She's fine with it.  Will call Pat shortly.

Alan who?  You mean Aleck?  Nope.  No sense at all.  He is a great guy.

PS I don't think that "To Welsh" is a politically correct term.

Jeff, Is Enron going to welch on their deals?

Call me,

Dot

call when u can.  IOUs jointly filed w/PUC saying "no assignments."  Jeff

Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:

As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
(I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....)
However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
OK, back to Enron.
It's a mess (surprise).
I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.
Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied.
HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

First, thanks for the pizza.  

Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Joseph:

Good news!  Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.  All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.  I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some "beefing up."

I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.  I'll let you know how she responds.

Great job by all.

Best,
Jeff

Hi.  Hey, I can't open this.

Hugs,

Thanks, very much Alan.  Hedy, Bev and Scott are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.  Let's do this.  I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.  Sound reasonable?

Paul, Jeff:

I got on the IEP Board distribution list (Parquet is also on it).  Are there any actions we need to take with our Sacto lobbiests that I can help with?

Alan
Dear IEP Board Member,

During the December 13th IEP Board Planning Meeting, a special session for
Board Members and your contract Lobbyist is being planned.  This special
session will be held between 1:00 pm and 3:00 p.m., Sterling Hotel,
Sacramento.   This memo is sent to you as a notice so that, if possible, you
can arrange for your contract Lobbyist to be available during that time.
Please don't hesitate to contact IEP if you have any questions.

Paul:
Thanks very much for the note.  For the moment, we do still intend to go ahead with the projects and will stay in very close contact with you should the situation change.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and Stan:

I lead the group responsible for assuring safe, reliable and timely
generation electric interconnections with PG&E's D and T systems. I work
closely with Rod Boschee's group that handles gas gen interconnections.

I just wanted to check in with Enron to see if the company was still
planning to go ahead with the Los Banos project and the Lodi project. It's
important we know Enron's plans to assure we conduct the most accurate
transmission planning studies possible given the number of projects in the
application process, notably at Los Banos. While we have sufficient funds to
continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's
desires. 

As for gas interconnection issues, given the discussions about the Lodi
project extension, it would be useful to know Enron's intent with that
project also.

Thanks,

Paul Sivley
Manager, Generation Interconnection Services

 

Here's where I left off:  At least 3 things that need to be included:

1. Port exercises prepay.
2. ABM sells lease (capital gains?).
3. Depreciation expense/benefit.  

Take a peek and let me know what you think.

Kisses,
Jeff

Got your message. Likely makes sense to also call Evie Elsesser and Dan Carroll.  Let me know if there's anything else.

Best,
Jeff

Great.  You know this is a pure "lobbyist" meeting, right?  You may want to do by phone, if possible.  Your call.

OK.

Let them know I am planning on attending (I have and Enron-paid ticket in hand which I will use).

Greetings Professor:
I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:

--I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.

--I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.

Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

Here's my take.  Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  

Best,
Jeff

FYI ...

It makes no sense to me to engage our lobbyists in the meeting.  There is no next year for them--i.e., we will not be retaining them in 2002--unless things change dramatically.  

So ....

Thanks Robert.  Sounds good. FYI.  Prentice and I are getting Haley the portable CD player.

here's the list as a jpeg file so at least you can read the file on a pc ;)

Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.  Again, apologize for keeping on about it.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks very much?  Does that mean that the Hansen contract would be sold as a stand-alone asset?

             They are included in the CAL book but not in the 24 as they were added after the count was 24.   as of 12 noon, we were still waiting data from ENA but had the contract and had included in the iniitail due diligence.

Was this ever scheduled?  When?  Thanks.

Thanks. I think we would definitely be interested.

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

As soon as I get my grades (which I hope will be mid-late December), I'll send them to Ginger in the attempt to get tuition reimbursed.  But don't worry, I have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed.  This plan make sense?

A step in the right direction- the CDWR paid their bill in full for the
February 2001 trade month.

The ISO will be disbursing the dollars a week from today.  One other
important highlight is that the ISO invoiced the DWR for all charges
associated with meeting the net short of the utilities and they did pay in
full- we were expecting they would make only a partial payment. I'm glad we
were wrong.  We can now hold our breath for the rest of the $$.  Please give
me a call with any questions

One other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.

You have just used your quota of exclamation points for the remainder of this year and for all of 2002.  It was very fun.

Thank you so much for a wonderful night on Friday.  You were far too
generous in paying for dinner since the wine and corkage were our share and
there wasn't much of that!  It was so fun and I think Prentice really had a
good time too.  Lots  of love and kisses!

Oh Nancy - I'm am so very sorry.  You know I've been there all too many

but the love and companionship they give so eagerly is worth every minute of

the pain.  Annie was such a special dog and Sabrina loved to play with her.

In the long run, Prentice will feel better having been there with her - I

I'd love tickets. but don't kill yourself over.  Get better--cold's not bad, but it's damned annoying.

Snorkel?  I'm not sure I understand the reference. 
Naturally, my mind leaps readily to the vulgar and
prurient:  I could guess that one would use such a
device if one were kissing ass so deeply that one
would suffocate without a piped-in air supply
(crikey!), but then, having a snorkel in one's mouth
would render one unable to kiss effectively--ass or
otherwise--thereby defeating the purpose of said
object.  Just--a--hold your breath, shut your eyes and
pucker up, I always say.  With practice, one should
get along fine without additional devices.

heh heh, sheesh.

Thanks for the warning, though, as I will undoubtedly
have a hangover Saturday morning resulting from our
company Xmas party on the preceding evening.
  
I too am coming down with a cold, so next week will be
okay with me, but is Monday night free?  I have Bach's
Christmas Oratorio with the Symphony all the rest of
the week.  If you and Prentice are interested, I might
be able to get you tickets.

Jeanne, with Heather's assistance, please contact Jeff D. ASAP and get  the
details so that Enron (I believe the EES and EEMC entities are at issue, but
I do not know for sure which one) need to file their $1000 fee and their
registration update forms, as they are tardy.  They  will also owe SEction
394.25 standard service plan forms and must update their deposit bond by
Jan. 2, 2002.  Please help get this taken care of ASAP, Jeff considers it a
priority--and needless to say does not trust me to do it correctly.  Thanks,
Mike

Sweet. Thanks.

There are several comps available to the singers, but
we have a lottery for them, as there are not enough

Nancy:

Here is the final.  Couple things.  The short answers are in the word document.  The long answers  are in two separate excel files.  I used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer (the Fannie Mae question).  You can find the answer in a tab titled "Long Answer--Question IIb" and it's highlighted by yellow background.  The data for the problem is in the "data" tab.

Thanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future.

All the best,
Jeff

Here they are.  Please let me know that you've received them. 

Joseph:  good luck including duration to the correct spreadsheet!  And thanks for sending them along to Nancy.  Let's talk and figure out a time to get together.

How much do I owe you for me and Prentice for the golf?

can you please fax thing we were faxing yesterday to jeremy.  i'm much obliged.

Please fax to me at 7136468008

Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,

Thanks.  Hanging in there about as well as everyone is.  No worries on getting back to me.  Just wanted to keep folks in the loop.  Been in contact with the desk.  Best of luck with the transaction. Enjoy the time off.  Talk to you in a couple days.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
Thanks for this and all of the prior updates.  Thanks als for the calls last week, or was it the week prior.  The last couple of weeks have been brutal.  Hopefully things get better from here.

I have been leaving the day to day management of the ees/iso situation in the capable hands of steve hall and jeff richter.  So far so good, although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon.

I'm taking the next couple of days off.  I'll call you towards the end of the week t catch up.  Sorry I've been so hard to reach.

I hope that you are hanging in there.

Tim

I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester.  Just wanted to say congratulations.  I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish.  Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.  Happy Holidays to all.  

And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:
Just checking in.  What's up? Hope all is OK, or at least as OK as it can be.

How in the world did you get Brown to vote for the NGS?!  Very impressive.

Also, couldn't believe it when I saw Frank Lindh in the news.  My heart goes out to him.

Sure seems like folks will be testifying before Congress (much) rather than later...Oh, and remind me to thank Anderson for their supportive comments--looks like a mud-fight is brewing.  

Hope you're doing OK.

Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

FYI:
On the call today with Jeremy Blachman & Co. today, we decided to the do the following:

Sue will make sure that EES legal (Mike Smith) reviews ARMs petition to modify the Commission's order suspending DA.
Sue will send Jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and Jeremy will use it to solicit participation from Enron customers (i.e., see if any are willing to sign the petition).
Jeff will work with Karen Denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to Legislators in the event Davis is successful in calling them back in October to work on energy matters.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Date:      September 7, 2001

Re:        Action Needed for Veto on Workers' Comp Bill (SB 71)

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers'
compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on
its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers

$3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to
help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the
Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a
negotiating mood.

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor

entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a
$1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous
to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton
and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press
conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a
slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB
71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers'
costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured
workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or
someone else.

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the
governor's point person on workers' compensation said, "the
governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of
labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion
about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is
comfortable with."  Smith dismissed the threat of labor
turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has
stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he
would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else.

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that
employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on
SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at http://www.cmta.net/issues/index.

The address for the Governor's Office is:

The Honorable Gray Davis
Governor of California

Not surprising, but thought you might be interested.  I responded that letting go is a good thing.

Best,

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

Go Barry!

Thanks again, Marchris.  How'd the conversation go?  If there's anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate.

Anything interesting (particularly with respect to ISO market manipulation) come out of yesterday's meeting?

Best,
Jeff

I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Best,
Jeff

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO=20

purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=

tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =

 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=

 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=

I'm back from the doctor.  I'll just take the time against lunch (i.e., I'll work through lunch), so no need to worry about any time accounting.  If there's any issues with that approach, just let me know.  Thanks a bunch.

Talked to Pat Mason.  Give a call when you get a chance.

Jeff

I thought that you said it was $60/person?

If you mean "golf" it's too much; If you mean "gold" it's not enough.  We're rooting for Barry too.

Sent you guys a check yesterday for $120 for me and Prentice.  Let me
know if that covers gold on Saturday.

Best,

Go Barry!

I'll keep that in mind...

Winning isn't everything, but it beats losing.  Also, I don't enjoy playing against people who always lose--unless I'm playing ping pong, golf or Spades.

Thanks again for your gracious hospitality over the weekend and a very
happy anniversary.  Eldon, you were particularly nice to let me win at
just about everything we did.  

How much do I owe you for me and Prentice for the golf?

Retroactivity (July 1)
No contract renewal
No incremental "DASR'ing", i.e., adding/subtracting load on the margin (fast food chains, for example)
Cost allocation risk (e.g., IOU undercollection, bonds, DWR undercollection gets distributed to DA customers)

Before providing elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete list of the key risk areas.  Please add to/subtract from this list, and then I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Thanks,
Jeff

Before providing more elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete--but stripped-down--list of the key risk areas.  Please add anything I may have missed, send it back, and I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!  I'd like to introduce our three
new rookies:

The Deitrick's - Val and Scott - from napa
Andy Bledsoe - from Napa
Kent Deverell - from San Francisco

Good luck to all!!

Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks)
and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.  If he is, we'll have a total of
27; if not it'll be 26.  We'll send out a completed report of the projected
payouts before the first week of the season starts.

Attached are two Excel files.  The first one just has the pick sheet for
week #1

One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to:
1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel
2)	Fill in the information at the top
3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under
it by the team you want to pick.  (This will also give you a check figure at
the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not
necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file
5)	Use "FORWARD" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com
6)	If you use "REPLY" the attachment does not get sent

It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the
statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your
picks this way.

Here is an Excel workbook that contains a tab for every week - so all 17
weeks are here plus a sample.  However, all you need to send back is the
sheet for the current week.  Just to make it easier, (or in case you've
misplaced the attachment) we'll send out, via e-mail, each upcoming week's
pick sheet in time for you to make your selections.   If you have any
questions about Excel please give me a call at (707) 255-4813 or call Nancy
at (707) 251-4870.

Eldon

Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?

Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  

I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.

Thanks.

You might add the following:

Utility Processing Risk  -  will the utilities try to reject contracts that
are pre-Sept 20 but which are DASR'd afterwards for one reason or another,
or will the utilities try to impose other restrictive requirements to limit
the number of post July 1 contracts they must switch to DA?

Confidentiality Issues _ As part of their policing responsibility on this
issue, the utilities will likely try to insist on seeing all post July 1 DA
contracts, including sensitive provisions, and we will have to resist giving
sensitive commercial information.

Mike Day

Before providing more elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a
complete--but stripped-down--list of the key risk areas.  Please add
anything I may have missed, send it back, and I'll take a shot at
fleshing it out.

Did I tell you that Fawcett left for greener pastures?

	On Sept 21, SoCalGas filed its BCAP.  They propose a new firm
receipt point trading program based on the open season proposed in the
comprehesive settlement.  The also propose a return to embedded cost rates,
and an elimination of any transmission load risk for the utility.  We should
discuss whether Enron wishes to participate in this case, which will clearly
be a new vehicle for putting gas strategy issues before the commission.  Let
me know if you need a copy of the application.   Mike Day

You saw my previous email?

Jeff, can you forward this to Jeff Fawcett?   I must have the wrong email
address for him, and the message was rejected.  Thanks, Mike

Really appreciate it.  I'll be up there this weekend.  If you, or one of your guys, want to drop by, I think that we could pencil it out in about 30 minutes.  Let me know if that works for you.  And thanks again.  Really appreciate it.

Best,
Jeff

Hello Jeff,

We're winding down a large project , about two more weeks, and preping
to begin another, but we should have a small window of opportunity to
get to your project, if you're still interested in having us do the
work.

So we need to meet or I need more info from you to get a good idea of
exactly what you want.

Please let me know.

Thank you!

See story below.

State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale 
California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. 
The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. 
And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. 
With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. 
The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. 
"We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." 
Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. 
Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. 
The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. 
But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. 
With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. 
This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. 
But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. 
Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. 
"I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. 
Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. 
The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. 
But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. 
Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. 
Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. 
"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. 
As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. 
"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. 
The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. 
The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. 
Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." 
Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."

Sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw, I'm next in line for meetings with Brown.  I've asked Mike Day to set up a meeting with Brown, me and Mike to begin our efforts to rehabilitate Mr. Brown.

See what a good night sleep can do!  We'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list.

You know what? I'm happy to go as well.

According to Assembly Member Migden's office, if enacted, they believe ABX2
9 does provide the CPUC with adequate direction to address community
aggregation separate from other forms of direct access.  They have also had
conversations with the Treasurer's office who informed them that as written,
the Treasurer does not believe ABX2 9 would pose a problem for the bonds.
That said, they have still not received any indication from the Governor's
office as to whether or not he will sign the measure into law so they have
not had conversations with the CPUC.

Just so we're clear.  To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation,"  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.

Best,
Jeff

According to Assembly Member Migden's office, if enacted, they believe ABX2
9 does provide the CPUC with adequate direction to address community
aggregation separate from other forms of direct access.  They have also had
conversations with the Treasurer's office who informed them that as written,
the Treasurer does not believe ABX2 9 would pose a problem for the bonds.
That said, they have still not received any indication from the Governor's
office as to whether or not he will sign the measure into law so they have
not had conversations with the CPUC.

Can you send the draft letter Tracy refers to re: letter to legislators?

AReMers:

This memo from Angelides outlines what has happened and what still needs to
happen at the PUC before bonds can be issued.  He mentions that no appeals
to the DA suspension have yet been filed but that the deadline has not yet
passed.  When are we filing our appeal? I'd like to send out a news release
the morning we file the appeal if AReM agrees.

On another matter, just so we're all on the same page, Norm and I produced
the letter to Davis and legislative leadership which you all received
yesterday for final approval.  The Weintraub column handout has also been
mocked up and Norm is going to pick that up this morning from our office.

thanks.

He believes his interests are aligned with Jeremy's.  He is TOTALLY on board with our approach -- agrees that we must try to get DA reinstated.  He said we have the worst of all possible worlds right now -- no DA and uncertain rules.  He realizes hedging is a problem with the uncertain rules but can deal with it.

ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE
     In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray 
Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the 
paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of 
California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With 
commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the 
Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that 
requires customers to buy power from their local utility company 
is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy 
purchases.
     The negative impact on California businesses, some already 
in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and 
discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. 
It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an 
economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County 
Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25,

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Straight to the Source

Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news. Importantly, the merger settlement provided $32 million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania.

This year, the company's wholesale trading and marketing unit, Power Team, presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise - signing long-term contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania. These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement, and are not included in the $32 million earmarked for renewable energy funding.

Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East, the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing 78 MW of generation online from these new wind farms, two of which will be operational next month. The 15 MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week, and the 9 MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week.

Mike Freeman, the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible, gave us some insight into Exelon's renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into America's power grids.
All of the wind is Green-e certifiable as "new" resources. All of the landfill methane is qualified under Green-e, but only 10 MW is new generation. Of the hydro, all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the low-impact hydro standards. The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Green-e, but the biomass plant is. 

Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio?
There were two principal reasons: a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace, and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel, emissions, and cost.

Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome?
I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business. I don't think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases. Part of the hands-off approach was due to, I believe, a sense that renewable products only meant the re-packaging of existing generation, not changing the power system in any way. 

Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system. For me that's the most important part of our participation - to help encourage new development. I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable, and that demand for these products could be sustaining. 

Will this encourage new development? 
Generators get a creditworthy counter-party that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location, but is also willing to talk about additional new projects. Over time, other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same. If this chain of events occurs, I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter, just like other energy products now. 

How do renewables fit into Power Team's overall business strategy?
We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio. So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy. More specifically, we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy, not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards, but also because of natural demand. The average person may not think of it this way, but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements.  

Why Wind?
There's no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements, under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects. A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in 1998, and especially the off-peak power market beginning in 2000 and continuing into this year. A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years, and a realization that we need to develop a wide-ranging set of answers to meeting the demand, including supply-side and demand-side solutions. We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources. 

What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal?
The first is probably the need for a long-term contract. Wind generators typically want to enter into fixed-price, long-term agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period. We don't have a problem with long-term deals per se, although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well. We don't want to hold multiple long-term agreements and nothing else. 

In my discussions with generators so far, there has been some flexibility on contract length. In fact, our willingness to enter into a long-term contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built. Beyond the long-term contract, the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investment-grade rating. Exelon Generation is rated A- by S&P so we are a natural counter-party for project financing. Right now, there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of credit-worthiness that we have. 

Will that always will be the case? 
No. If we're right about long-lasting demand, I think other large companies, including distribution companies, will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects. We've teamed up with a retail marketer, Community Energy, to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it. In the development of conventional generation, it is not always necessary to enter into 20-year agreements for a project to get built. For example, a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a long-term basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods. And in some cases, the financing source may be comfortable with a shorter-term agreement for the whole thing. 

Is there a financial advantage for wind?  
If one's view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value, a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have. Wind has one key advantage over other resources - perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility. This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present. 

It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term. But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project, outside of significant advances in technology. Over a long period of time, 15 or 20 years, I think the probability of fixed-price wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite.

I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next 15 to 20 years. 

Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio?
With conventional generation and firm transmission paths, a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets, whether they are hourly, daily, monthly, or longer. Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing, amount and ultimate sink of expected output. 

The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to 100% of the time as possible, so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesn't match scheduled energy. The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different, because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy. 

I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio. We're one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets - that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a 50 MW wind project into our overall mix.

How does intermittent generation add complexity?
A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows, not when you flip the switch on. It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency, even for an experienced organization like ours, because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind. You don't have the ability to give transmission providers real-time information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand. 

In PJM, where generators can offer increments of generation on a day-ahead or real-time basis, and receive (or pay) market-clearing prices depending on actual generation, wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties. An obstacle, and we're working with PJM on this right now, is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than 20-minute notice when self-scheduled or must-run generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity. For purposes of regulating the system, PJM then has the ability to tell the self-scheduled generator to go ahead and generate, or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the real-time balance of supply and demand. 

This will not be practical with wind generation. We'd literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do. In the must-run scenario, we'd still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators. Either way, we'd have to predict output, which is a dicey 
proposition. 

Does that make wind generation unreliable?
Not at all. We've got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time, such as a full year. Those predictions underlie our contracts. But it's another thing to tell the wind when to blow. The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what I've described. In PJM, a 54,000 MW system, this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about 25 MW of wind generation in the system right now, but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives. A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system. 

The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution. 

How can scheduling and other rules  better accommodate intermittent resources like wind?
An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as "negative" load instead of generation. Which is to say, when the plant is generating electricity, the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating. When the plant is not generating, the load will increase. A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve. In this unique circumstance, which of the ancillary services apply to negative load, and at what level? We're working with PJM on these questions. 

I'm uncertain whether a significant amount of so-called negative load will require any kind of real-time notice to the transmission provider. Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load, and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way. Other countries, and the western U.S. transmission systems, have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation, and so can we. 

Are you working on other approaches?
Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a real-time energy market, to a control area that does have such a market. The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis.  The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment. However, notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach.

Will PJM resolve these problems?
Yes. PJM is progressive and innovative, and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the scheduling/imbalance issue. It's hard now because we're breaking new ground. I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed. 

How big might your renewable portfolio get? Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects? 
As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy, we'll continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose long-term forward economics support the purchase of energy. I'd like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market, such as PJM, to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve - with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output.

We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed. We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on. If we execute a contract successfully, we'd like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company. Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp. and National Wind Power. 

What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster?
We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment, standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation, financial innovations to allow more risk-sharing, and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage. 

Perhaps most importantly, we need consumers to buy the wind energy!

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.  Seems there would be two issues  that might concern us:  1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.  Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.  Thoughts?

Sue:
Just talked to the Chamber.  Add them to the petition for rehearing.  CMTA will be back to me soon.  If they don't sign it's only because they'll file separately, but I think they're likely to join ARM's.

Best,
Jeff

The meeting will happen.  Will only be a matter of who attends.  I'll let you know what I hear back.  Good luck with everything else.

Best,
Jeff

You rock.

Hopefully they will actually respond.  I'll keep you informed as to the
continuation/conclusion of the pilot so that this meeting gets scheduled
after that time.

Thanks!!!!

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Eve and Bill:
This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a) maintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.
 
All the best,

Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue of retroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state and federal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 

The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtood weekend!

Anything of note from the FERC/ISO/Generator meetings?

Today's FERC meeting was a big deal.   Some of the key actions are:

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

Alan Comnes

The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked

Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

DSTAR and RTO West are to be "married,"  The FERC wants a single western RTO but will wait on making CAISO merge with other western RTOs so that California can "heal its wounds." 
Every utility needs to declare which RTO it plans to join by 12/1/01 (or possibly 12/15; not sure of date).  Otherwise the utility will lose market-based rates, will be unable to get a merger approved, and will have its transmission rev req. scrutinized.
The commission favors 1 market structure applied to the four nationwide RTOs.   It plans on holding a week of workshops and issuing a NOPR to determine this structure.  The goal is to essentially re-issue the Order 888 tariff in a form that encompases the new functions of RTOs.  Although consistent business rules applied to large geographic markets are a good thing, expect this new effort and redefining the RTO to delay ultimate implementation.
Although California will be allowed to heal, it is ordering an operational audit of the Calfornia ISO.
Separately the FERC indicated the plan to issue a NOPR on market power and market based rates.   Expect new rules and procedure to determine whether a market is sufficiently competitive to allow for market based rates.

Further summary, prepared by Sarah Novosel in our Govt. Affairs DC office, is provided below:

The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to "marry up," meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an "RTO week" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some "sticks" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these "sticks" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how "FERC can get there."  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked

Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NOPR") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.
The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright>

Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

I'm hearing that it may be as early as today or tomorrow.

The Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee will hold
informational hearings on SBX2 78 this week upon call of the chair.

FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

Best,
Jeff 

I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.  As of
9:30 a.m. this morning the Governor has still not officially called for a
Third Extraordinary Session, or, for the Second Extraordinary Session to
reconvene.  In fact, Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual
golf excursion next Tuesday. In addition, while staff from the Senate and
the Administration have met, the Administration has yet to produce either a
new version of SBX2 78, or, amendments to the existing version of SBX2 78.
Staff reiterated that they believe there is still no chance of passing SBX2
78 in its current form.

Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis.
By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published Sept. 26, 2001) 
Gov. Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. 
The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. 
Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo. 
"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." 
In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. 
The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." 
"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." 
DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. 
In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. 
Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent. 
"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. 
"No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative." 
DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. 
Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. 
"It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." 
South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. 
"We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942."

I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:

1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and,
2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.

Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.

Sounds reasonable.  Let me know what time you can meet this weekend.  After noon on Saturday, and  anytime before 4 pm on Sunday works great for me.

Understanding that it's a T&M job, would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it?

Also, I've got some longer range plans (barn, house, etc.) for the property that I'd like to run by you, too, but that's longer off.  Really want to get the deck done before the rain starts.

Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Hello Jeff,

This would be a project that we, my guys and I would take on, not just a side job.  I propose we do the job on a T& M basis, which is essentially all I do anymore.

The following are my labor rates for my guys and myself, I don't do cash work as it leaves me and my employees vulnerable, should some accident occur.

J. Docker  $45.00/hr.
Paul $30.00/hr.
Dyton $30.00/hr.
Diaz $27.00/hr.

I tack 15% on top of labor and materials, when presenting an invoice. I request payment for ongoing projects on a bi-weekly basis or upon completion of the work.

If this meets with your approval, let me know so we can get together this weekend and go over your plan. As mentioned could probably start this project in about two weeks, and if its not to elaborate a plan could probably complete in about two weeks.

Home/office tel: 785-3929

Best Wishes,

Jim Docker

I'll forward to them.

Does someone at the Chamber want to see this?
Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th.  There are two primary changes.  The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes.
 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated.  Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft.  Thanks!

Energy: An independent audit finds the utility's return was double the 15% the agency said it made selling power during the crisis. Officials deny price gouging.

By DOUG SMITH, RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ
Times Staff Writers

September 10 2001

During the peak of California's power crisis, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged, according to a newly completed independent audit.

The document, obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act, seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes.

The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov. Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private, out-of-state generating companies.

For months, DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just 15% above its costs.

As recently as July, former DWP chief S. David Freeman, who now heads Davis' new statewide power authority, repeated that assurance in a letter to U.S. senators probing the energy meltdown.

But the audit findings show that DWP's profits from electricity sales to power-starved areas of the state averaged 56% last year under Freeman's stewardship.

Overall, during the worst 13 months of the crisis ending in May, records show that the DWP profited $200 million on sales of $680 million. It says it is still owed $180 million.

Beyond those higher profits, the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity.

They include a $34-million cut for the city's general fund--essentially a bonus for the utility's owner--and an additional $42 million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agency's capital investments.

These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators.

In effect, unsuspecting ratepayers across the state, whose utilities have been battered by debt, are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay.

In an interview late last week, Freeman defended those costs and DWP's profits, saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants.

He insisted that he had issued "standing orders" to sell power at a profit of no more than 15%.

"We made a fair amount of money. It was not price gouging," said Freeman, who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year.

Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than 15%, then "I'm not embarrassed about it. It says nothing more than there's enterprise at [the] DWP."

The DWP's new general manager, David Wiggs, said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freeman's tenure.

"Maybe in hindsight," Wiggs said, "it would have been better not to be so specific, but to say, 'Look we're gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers.' "

Still, Wiggs said, even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated, it was not excessive. "We charged just and reasonable rates," he said, adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin.

Wiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity.

Conducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the study targeted a 13-month period beginning in May 2000. The results have provided critics with new ammunition.

"Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair," said Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union. "This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks, savings and loans and insurance companies--not a public agency."

Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the crisis, was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWP's profits were limited to 15%.

"This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny," he said after learning of the audit. "It would be ironic if it turns out that the L.A. Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov. Davis' 'Texas Pirates,' " said Thompson.

The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the state's deregulation of electricity began to backfire, with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding.

To keep the power flowing, the DWP--which had opted out of deregulation--cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market.

This helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced.

At the same time, however, the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis, official reports would later show. Freeman repeatedly said the utility's prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly, inefficient plants.

But the audit raises such serious questions about the DWP's behavior that the matter has spilled into the 2002 gubernatorial contest.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a possible Republican challenger to Davis, last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure.

In a letter to his successor, James K. Hahn, the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling.

If so, he said, the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated $180 million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales.

A Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity.

"The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales," said Jaime de la Vega, a senior advisor to Riordan's campaign committee.

Freeman, now squarely in the Davis camp, disputes Riordan's account. He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agency's pricing strategy.

He wanted to charge more, according to Freeman, in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, which were slipping into insolvency.

Freeman described Riordan's view as: "If we're gonna continue to sell it to them, we ought to get a lot of money. He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it."

For the most part, the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in California's haywire energy market. Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market, including his agency.

But according to a report by the state's grid operator, DWP was one of the most aggressive, along with the trading arm of BC Hydro, the government-owned utility in British Columbia.

Yet another report--this one by the state's power-buying agency--found that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year.

The report said DWP charged an average of $292 per megawatt hour, asking more than many private generators.

It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher.

Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year, the DWP collected profits more than 40% higher than it claimed to have netted, records show.

Overall, during the 13-month period audited, profits averaged 29%, double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving.

Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texas-based energy suppliers, Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of government-owned utilities.

One key question is whether those agencies, like private suppliers, should be forced to refund excess profits.

The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged.

DWP insists it is outside the commission's jurisdiction. But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities.

The leading proponent of that course is state Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside).

In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month, he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are "merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of in-state public utility agencies."

The chairman of that committee, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 

September 26, 2001

By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 

SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
T
 he investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup."

Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.

The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.

Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.

"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn.

The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter.

"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said.

Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 

"It was an emergency," Fishman said.

"We had to take action.'' 

What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 

"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.

"All hell broke loose.''

Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.

"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.

Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.

In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.

The generators got their way.

The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.

Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 

They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 

What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.

Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 

Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it.

"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 

With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.

"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 

Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show.

Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.

Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.

Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.

"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 

Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted.

"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.

"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."

The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said.

James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter.

"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 

"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."

What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.

"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Haven't heard anything about it, though Sue's been closer to these issues.

Do you know anything about this?  Can you offer any insights?

Diann and Mike,

Attached is a notice we propose sending to our customers that were overcharged UUT as a result of PG&E's billing practices.  Because of the UUT refund statute of limitations,  the sooner the notices are sent the fewer refund dollars our customers will lose.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the notice further or if it is acceptable for sending with the spreadsheets that Diann's group is putting together showing the amount of the potentially overpaid UUT.  

Thanks,

Jeff

Congratulations and best of luck.  Hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you, given your new responsibilities.  Big country to cover.  

All the best,
Jeff

For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.  Option 3 is the most prudent, and preferable, path.

Best,
Jeff

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.  Understanding that "new" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  

The 3 choices I see are:

1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.
2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.
3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.

It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS

talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  and we're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
 
how's things?

When you guys going to the dome? will we be able to get together for a few minutes before you depart on Friday?  Perhaps we could sit in front of one of your PCs and look a possible weekend spots for my b-day.

Also, I'd like to discuss the david thing....I'm interested in your view...... 

attachment?

I thought maybe we could help these people and put them up at the Dome, or, 
better, on Jeff's property...

babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?

anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push back.

her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even more gorgeous (if that's possible).

best,
Jeff

OK, so the oct 15th date is a little too early.  The pilot review with execs
at enron is at the end of the month.  SO, we should target early November
for this meeting.  Can you help facilitate that?

What did you think of PP's hair.  I was shocked.  It looked really good!

We are tentatively scheduled for a Pilot Review with the VP of EES on 10/30
in Houston, so early Nov. for this meeting is probably the best bet.
I pushed this date way out.  We can easily push it out more. Jeff fully
understands that we want to schedule this meeting after the pilot has been
completed (not get in the way, see the real value of the system
first...etc.).  My question to you is when is the pilot scheduled to be
completed so I have a time frame on when these discussions might take place.

Thanks,

Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project-we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES-acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time-the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

meet for a drink after work?

Things is good. Our new ORA director is really engaging and starting to make some shifts around here.  good to have someone who cares, is competent, and tough.  
 
I'm off the bottle for a few weeks to get a true read on my cholesterol. Seems alcohol is processed first by the liver and is converted quite readily into fats that then become precursors to cholesterol ....  Feels good, easy to do......

Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th. There are two primary changes. The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes. 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated. Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft. Thanks!

	Draft of transcribed message from Richard Sanders voice mail (Legal) to Rick Shapiro.  Rick forwarded to Jim Steffes.

	FYI:

	"We have not seen the Reliant Protective Order.  It's only been described to me by their General Counsel.  And in the way it was described it was a document that  we would probably agree to, because there's still some corks(? and provisions over disagreements about the Confidentiality. 

		So, I'm gonna try to get Mike Kirby to get ahold of it this a.m. in terms of the theme to the Legislators.  The question I've got is why haven't we even been offered that same deal?  It shows clearly that they're trying to isolate us, and that they're treating us differently from everyone else., but I'm not sure how far that goes....."

	

you rock.  cleca signing on?

Tell them OK.

Thanks, Ed

Folks-
Please see attached. AReM would like as many folks to sign on as possible.
Respond to Sue or Jeff.

Thanks,

Here it is.  If you could get it to all the usual suspects, that would be
great.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff asked that I send this to you. Must be filed by Friday. We're trying to
get as many parties as possible to join with us. Love to have you with us.

Here is the first draft.

Really don't want to write anymore notes.  while he's a friend, and i've known him since he was a lowly VP, sending lots of emails to CEOs, even in a flat org. like enron, is, well, bad form.  let's see what happens.  just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take place prior to the EES debrief.  The cooking thing is great.  The funniest thing is that Prentice has always said that she hates rice, and therefore risotto.  so i'm psyched.

Maybe you could send an email to them now explaining when the pilot is
supposed to finish and that it might be better to schedule after that date.
That way you are also bringing us up and having them think about us again.
Pure psychology.

I think PP really liked the cooking class.  She looked cute in the apron and
she now knows everything about soaking and draining mushrooms.  Did she tell
you that she is going to make you risotto (with out OWN veal stock) next
Monday night???

Is there a conference call today?  I couldn't get into yesterday's call; the code didn't work and the operator had no other record of a call.

No kidding.  However, it's safe to say that all concerned believe that your comparably quality and well-equipped to fill his shoes.  Hope to see you on the golf course soon.

Thanks Jeff.  Aleck is a quality person and he'll be missed.

Congratulations and best of luck.  Hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you, given your new responsibilities.  Big country to cover.  

All the best,
Jeff

Slight correction.  If, in fact, they actually come back next week, we'll likely stay with Tues/Thur.  If they end up NOT coming back, we may cancel regular call altogether, and continue for rest-of-year on "as needed" basis.  But we're still figuring and will get back to you.  We'll know more when we know more about what the heck the legislature is going to do, or not do.
 
Best,
Jeff

Sorry, Ken.  SOmeone was supposed to call you yesterday.  I believe we're going to 9 am Wed weekly calls.  We'll be setting up a call-in number for it.

you're not billing by the word now are you?  :)

I also agree.  Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation
issues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities
will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go
screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any
portion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20.  As indicated in
previous calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept
20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be
extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct
access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension
IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20.  At this
time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although
as Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which
will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the
commission on these issues.  Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural
schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues.

Bottom line:  The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by
means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after
Sept. 20.  Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the
existing agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal
or extension issue is addressed by the Commission.  Post Sept. 20 amendments
to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the
pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.  Option 3 is the most prudent,
and preferable, path.

No problem.  Your sense that the commercial folks going to be OK with this approach?

It's worth a hell of a lot.  Thanks.

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.  Understanding that "new" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  

The 3 choices I see are:

1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.
2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.
3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.

It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have.
Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

I agree.  Sue, I'm willing to join Mike in a meeting with Bilas. Mike, can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning?  Sue: Can you meet with Brown/Gamson? Others have thoughts about these meetings?

PS  Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.  Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron." Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.

Best,
Jeff

As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

Great minds think alike.  That is EXACTLY the opening line that Wanda and Michael and I came up with on a brief call this morning.  Will do.

Tell them to do what PG&E did in their reorg. plan and have Fielder tell Bryson to get his head out of Davis's _ss.

As far as i know, we can get together tomorrow night.

Hey, but when are you going to the dome tomorrow????  would there be time to get together?

couldn't agree more.  was just kidding.

sure, no prob, coke?  Really, truly, I intend to be quite normal and no fuss.  This is good for me.

meet for a drink after work?

Things is good. Our new ORA director is really engaging and starting to make some shifts around here.  good to have someone who cares, is competent, and tough.  
 
I'm off the bottle for a few weeks to get a true read on my cholesterol. Seems alcohol is processed first by the liver and is converted quite readily into fats that then become precursors to cholesterol ....  Feels good, easy to do......   

talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  andw e're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
 
how's things?

When you guys going to the dome? will we be able to get together for a few minutes before you depart on Friday?  Perhaps we could sit in front of one of your PCs and look a possible weekend spots for my b-day.

Also, I'd like to discuss the david thing....I'm interested in your view...... 

FYI.

Will do.  Did you folks have a call today?  If you folks are going to have one every week, could we set up a standing time and call-in number?  Be happy to participate on these and any other issues.

Best,
Jeff	

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and "Hot Button" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

regards, 

Barry Tycholiz  

Perfect.  Thanks.

Thanks - look forward to your input.  We have a meeting today to discuss comments due in El Paso's reallocation proceeding. How about we get you on the line next week.

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

We are OUT of the pool.  I want my money back.  Prentice, please get your stuff out of my apartment.  You can have the cats.

Thanks for helping, Nancy. So what place are we in?

As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.  

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?

It's hardball time.  I'd be careful going up against UC/CSU, though.

He suggested the state could cut all funding for UC and CSU???!!!.  Just
because they like direct access?  The man is insane.

 << File: PX Summary 091401.xls >> 

Jeff,

I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron.  This amount is net of the payments made by SCE.  A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month.  But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. 

To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. 

Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.   If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.  

We have not really tried to "tie" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.  Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.  EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.   

Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else.  If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway. 

Wanda

Thanks very much for all your help.  Can I call you tomorrow morning to discuss?  

Best,
Jeff

PS Shapiro likes to kid.  We're going to do everything we can in the meeting to try to settle this darn thing.

But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. 

To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. 

Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.   If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.  

We have not really tried to "tie" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.  Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.  EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.   

Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else.  If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway.

Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis
By Michael B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week. 

Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.  My flight arrives on Southwest  (from Oakland) at about 8 AM.  I've rented a car.  Then we can drive to Edison from there (it's about 30 minutes from the airport), east of Pasadena on 10.  Then I can drive you back with me from Rosemead and you can catch a cab from Burbank to LAX.  Should be pretty easy that way.

On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

 

Thanks.  I'll call you in the afternoon.

Jeff

I will be here all day.  Afternoon is better than the morning.  You name the time. 

Wanda

Thanks very much for all your help.  Can I call you tomorrow morning to discuss?  

Best,

PS Shapiro likes to kid.  We're going to do everything we can in the meeting to try to settle this darn thing.

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.

  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Key risks associated with each category:
Adverse to P/L 
Adverse to hedge (demand risk)

No problem here.  That price is making DWR's contracts look worse and worse every day.  Poor California.  Jeff, if you have questions or want to discuss further, don't hesitate to call me or Sue, though Paul can likely answer most questions.

Best,
Jeff

I don't see an issue with this.  I've cc'd Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara to check in with them (while I can see California's pulse on the monitor, they actually have their hand on California's throat)!!!

Mike & Paul,

I have been asked by a consultant to the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission to provide a notional number for a 400 MW power supply at NP-15 starting 01-01-02 for 5 years. I had Jeffrey Oh price this but I do not want to send a term sheet until I am sure your OK with this. The situation is that LAFCO has initiated a "30,000 ft. level feasibility study of a measure that is on the ballot to form a new muni in San Francisco and Brisbane. 

Jeff

The price for 7x24 power for NP15 for Jan-02 through Dec-06, 400 MW, is $35.85.

Jeffrey Oh

Did governor Jessie eliminate the role in Minnesota?  I believe that it's the equivalent of a state historian.  Thanks for the feedback.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

We welcome your input.  Thanks!

Jennifer--could you please send an electronic version of the matrix to Mr. Dasovich.  thanks.

Jeff--you'll note when you review the chart that we don't have anything on it regarding gas.  COuld you please provide Jennifer or me with into if you know it?  thanks.

No problem.  Thanks for the response.  I understand the need to keep powder dry.  Talked to Hertzberg this morning.  The 3rd extraordinary ain't sounding like it's going to be a winner.  Hope to talk soon.

Greetings Eve and Bill:
This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a)m aintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: 

The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtoodw eekend!

SCE's problem is that no one except Davis and Edison are for the bailout.  With respect to DA, only Burton's in the way.  So Davis and Edison have the world against; and DA only has Burton against it.  I'm at loss to determine which is worse off, which speaks to the craziness of the state of things.

Good idea.  Thanks.  Yes, I'm around.

You're just aiming to pick a fight w/ Freeman!!  One point I would really hit home after saying that an inexperienced buyer, DWR, was buying power for the state, is that the amount of debt incurred by the state -- that will now have to be burdened by ALL residents -- has thrown California into financial peril, depleting reserves, taking $$ away from education, etc., for at least the next two decades.

You around today?  I still need to talk to you.

Joe Pratt is the Cullen Professor of Business and History at the University of Houston and author of several energy business histories such of ConEd, Amoco, Texas Eastern Transmission Company, and the National Petroleum Council.  He will visit the issue from the vantage point of how are energy corporations perceived in the debate and controversy.  He is not an economist but is more market oriented than he used to be.  He is buddies with a Cal State professor, Chris Casteneda, who was Pratt's student at UH.

Dr. Pratt is also involved in the Enron oral history project with me.

THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED 
Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. 
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. 

Check this out.  I want to get any comments you might have before I sent it around.

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.

  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Additional suggestions from Mike Day:

5.	DASR processing:	Related to #1 above, in that, if the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension 	in an onerous way, it may put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:	The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.

Key risks associated with each category:
Adverse to P/L 
Adverse to hedge (demand risk)

fyi.

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc.

An attorney for Reliant sent a letter on behalf of five Southern California Edison creditors (Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron, Puget Sound Energy) to SCE today requesting a meeting to discuss the terms of a forbearance agreement.  The following is the statement we are using with the media:

We are interested in getting paid and in discussing constructive solutions.  This letter is aimed at advancing that.  We have no plans at this time to participate as a petitioning creditor in an involuntary bankruptcy filing.  In fact, this letter is an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.

See my and Sue's email.

Let's set up the meetings.  Don't you think?

Jim
As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said. 

"I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our con=
sideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.  I just wanted=
 to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t=
hings further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed =
like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based =
upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n=
ature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair t=
o Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=
 had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate=
 your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit=
uation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would ha=
ve the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceeding=
s in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm'=
s situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the releva=
nt facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use =
those words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you "ni=
xed" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=
  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s=
ense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b=
een pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start=
er since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid=
e from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is on=
e thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated co=
mmercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I c=
ould not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's in=
terests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we=
 knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would=
 be adverse to Enron.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be=
en adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=
 "eye to eye" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been s=
ituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh=
ere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i=
ncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro=
ceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminat=
e or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, althou=
gh I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size =
of our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.

Jeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a=
 quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.   I'=
m sure we will be speaking soon on some CA regulatory matter or the other.

I love it.  Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.  But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it.

What if we started offering some better deals?  Save the state billions .... what do you think?

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue.

Thanks. You're call.  Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance.  Let me know what you think. Or, given the time crunch, just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--I also assume he'll spend his time 1) singing PA's praises and 2) claiming that DA can work, if done right, both of which are great messages.

Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.  He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.  He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.  I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.

Jim

Did governor Jessie eliminate the role in Minnesota?  I believe that it's the equivalent of a state historian.  Thanks for the feedback.

Best,

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later. 
On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."

I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."

The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:

Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
Bob Foster--Edison
Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
State Senator Debra Bowen
David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)

Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.

Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

"Trading Inefficiencies in California's Electricity Markets" (October 2001)
         PWP-086 by Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell, Christopher R. 
Knittel, and Catherine Wolfram

         We study price convergence between the two major markets for 
wholesale electricity in California from their deregulation in April 1998 
through November 2000, nearly the end of trading in one market.  We would 
expect profit-maximizing traders to have eliminated persistent price 
differences between the markets.  Institutional impediments and traders' 
incomplete understanding of the markets, however, could have delayed or 
prevented price convergence.  We find that the two benchmark electricity 
prices in California - the Power Exchange's day-ahead price and the 
Independent System Operator's real-time price - differed substantially 
after the markets opened but then appeared to be converging by the 
beginning of 2000.  Starting in May 2000, however, price levels and price 
differences increased dramatically.  We consider several explanations for 
the significant price differences and conclude that rapidly changing market 
rules and market fundamentals, including one buyer's attempt to exercise a 
form of monopoly power, made it difficult for traders to take advantage of 
opportunities that ex post appear to have been profitable.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report. 

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan
SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: 
"The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses." 
"We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal." 
"We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time." 
"Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives." 
The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually. 

Thanks very much.  I faxed one the PUC filed against the Colton contract.

Horrible, unfortunately.  He was the loudest, most articulate voice appearing before the PUC on the 20th, staunchly--and I mean staunchly--opposing DA.  If I see him, I'm going to get all over him.  But me thinks the contracts are in for a wild ride.

Good to see Bill Ahern back in the mix ...

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
"The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
"It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
"We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
"The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
"Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
"News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Two things.  1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.  2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.  Sure he'll be interested.  Your call.

Best,
Jeff

Joseph,

Can you work with Sue and set up a call for Wed.  afternoon.  Perhaps the same call could be our weekly meeting since Sue and Jeff are tied up on Thurs.

GAC

Oh dear.  Get a story straight?  That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?  Wednesday looks good for me.

My recollections is that Paul wanted a meeting before meeting with commercial folks to "get our story straight."  Can you set that up? Wed afternoon would work for me.

GAC

Jeff and I are still planning to thumb our noses at the terrorists and fly up there on Thursday morning.  We were planning on a 10 am to 2 pm meeting, working through lunch. Does this sound good to you two? 

Thanks.  I'm in Goucester Mass this week but am getting the message to folks from here.  You launching on the contracts?
 
Best,
Jeff

I talked to Loretta today. She is pleased with the business support for SB 18x, but wants to see similar effort for the PUC members. She said the Bilas alternate doesn't work, and that the votes need to be rallied to defeating the rate agreement. 
 
Peace, vjw

Calif PUC Postpones Vote On CDWR Rev Requirement

LOS ANGELES -- The California Public Utilities Commission has postponed until after Sept. 11 a vote to establish how much revenue the California Department of Water Resources will receive for power purchases through 2002, a spokeswoman said.

The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities since January. The CPUC decision would establish how much the CDWR could recover through rates from each utility for those power buys.

The proposed decision, originally scheduled for a vote Thursday, was made available for the first time Tuesday night. The vote on the proposal was postponed in order to allow time for parties to file comments, which are due by 5 p.m. Sept. 11.

A new date for a vote hasn't been set, but will occur "some time after comments are received," the CPUC said in a press release.

If NYG win - tied for 3rd
If Denver - around 8th (along with a lot of others)

We are OUT of the pool.  I want my money back.  Prentice, please get
your stuff out of my apartment.  You can have the cats.

Love,
Jeff

Thanks for helping, Nancy. So what place are we in?

As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice
message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the
paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the
games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle
and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that
you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on
the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered
all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what
you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm
sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when
you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. 

Best,
Jeff
  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

5.	[Added 10.01.01] Retroactive end to rate freeze: The utilities assert that the rate freeze ended as far back as May 2000 and 	have sued the PUC in court, asking the court to direct the PUC to end it.

Additional suggestions from Mike Day:

5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may put at risk [Dasovich, Jeff]   ontracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.

In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.  The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).

Best,
Jeff

We need to discuss the economics of this on our book (assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers).

Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Jeff

Thanks for coming by yesterday.  Look forward to getting the deck up and hopefully working on many other projects in the future.  Zip me a fax when you get the materials quote at 415.782.7854.

Jeff

Should you care, on Friday at the Hotel Monaco in SF, Law Seminars International is having a conference about electric restructuring in CA. The 8:30 AM panel is "status and implications of the PG&E Bankruptcy" with Jim Lopes and LInda Ekstrom.  I'll be in Sacramento that day.

Best,
Jeff 

This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.

That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).

Best,
Jeff

I invited Jim S.

I was assuming that Paul would facilitate.  Paul can you make this meeting? If not Paul, I was assuming it would be Sue or you.

Here's my  suggested Agenda

1. Clarify scope of meeting.  Calif. coverage or the entire West?

2. GA staff goes down the list of key cases that affect the curve (T, D, and utility G) and identifies who's covering cases

3. URM gives feedback on areas of their curves that may not be in GA's "radar"

4. Discussion over which cases should be monitoring mode and which we should be advocating a position.

Alan:
Two things.  1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.  2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.  Sure he'll be interested.  Your call.

Best,
Jeff

Joseph,

Can you work with Sue and set up a call for Wed.  afternoon.  Perhaps the same call could be our weekly meeting since Sue and Jeff are tied up on Thurs.

GAC

Oh dear.  Get a story straight?  That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?  Wednesday looks good for me.

My recollections is that Paul wanted a meeting before meeting with commercial folks to "get our story straight."  Can you set that up? Wed afternoon would work for me.

GAC

Jeff and I are still planning to thumb our noses at the terrorists and fly up there on Thursday morning.  We were planning on a 10 am to 2 pm meeting, working through lunch. Does this sound good to you two? 

FYI.  Big customers were hesitant to sign on to the ARM filing, but they were cajoled into filing on their own.  They seem to hit the mark pretty well.

Best,
Jeff

Cleca, CIU and CMTA signed on.

SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR

The Bond Structure
? Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of
the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power
purchase revenues and no other repayment source.
? Designed as a "net revenue bond," meaning bondholders are paid last and
all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net
revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1)
carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off
the bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the
overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the
overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by
ratepayers for 15 years.
? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in
place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least
the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will
generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs
for the life of the bonds.  
? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the
bonds are outstanding.

The Rate Agreement
? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends
over a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting
mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the
Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue
calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates
established at a level that satisfies DWR.
? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power
and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the
utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each
service territory. 
? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of
their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the
state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the
requirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever
revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in
the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.  
? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to
change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at the
end of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about
this provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested
that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to
continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through
Commission-approved revenue requirements.
? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state
during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being
exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals
will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the
State.
? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term
contracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those
contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would
not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that
would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.
? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and
collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for
failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.
? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter
or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely
need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains
in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds
are issued.   

The Challenges to the Rate Agreement
? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.
? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State
Treasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.
? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement,
including:
	o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's
revenue requirement 
	o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law,
and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power  
	o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal
because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR
Oppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the
physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution
networks. 

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 

"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 

The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 

The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 

CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. 

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

FYI. Pretty good letter from large customers urging the PUC to vote down the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC. With Loretta announcing today (and signaling to the Republicans on the Commission) that she'll be voting no on the rate agreement tomorrow, it looks like Davis and Angelides are in for a bad day.  Sort of chokes you up.

THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS
All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. 

The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.

Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. 

Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. 

Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include: 
+ Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate 
+ Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World 
+ International Business 
+ Wild Women 

This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.

FYI.

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

I'm real sorry to bug you with this, but you and I will need to do some research so that I can make sure that I'm reporting properly.  Please stop by when you get a minute.  Thanks very much.

Jeff

 

Do we have a boiled down version of the judge's proposed order in the PNW refund case? If we do, I'd like to start disseminating it liberally around California, and would also like to use it at this forum I'll be speaking at on Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Barry:

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff

In case you hadn't seen it, your pal Vikram's taking some pretty hard knocks right about now.  Hope all is well.
Best,
Jeff

The Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that:
the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).
the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.
If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.
Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.
Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.

Thanks very much.

Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas:

1. PG&E's Gas Accord 
2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding
3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport
4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service.
5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations
6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory

Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes.  

Please call  Barry or myself if you have any questions.

This will work for what I need to submit.  FYI:  I'm not going to get another person to help out on this, so I'm assuming that with me and the resources that I'll bring to bear, and with you folks and the resources that you'll devote, we'll be able to do an outstanding job of achieving the overall objective of taking a proactive regulatory stance in California.

Best,
Jeff

Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas:

1. PG&E's Gas Accord 
2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding
3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport
4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service.
5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations
6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory

Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes.  

Please call  Barry or myself if you have any questions.

PG&E Gas Accord--$10K
PUC proceeding to consider continuing PG&E's "Gas Accord."  The Gas Accord is PG&E's program to unbundle its backbone transmission and storage systems.  The program began in 1998 and will expire Q4/2002.
Sempra (SoCalGas) System Unbundling--$10K
Though PG&E's system has been unbundled since 1998, SoCalGas' system remains bundled.  The PUC has pressured SoCalGas to emulate PG&E's restructured system.
ENA Origination Support (Getting info from Tycholiz)--$$XXK
Rate related proceedings (PG&E/Sempra)--$1.5K
Every two years, the utilities are required to file with the PUC any price changes it desires to make.  These price changes can have a direct financial effect on ENA's, TW's and EES' business.
ENA power plant support--$2.5K
ENA Western Origination is developing numerous gas-fired power plants in California.  ENA seeks GA support in order to obtain gas services for those plants.
Transwestern infrastructure and origination support--$2.5K
Transwestern is either considering, or in the early stages of, developing additional pipeline infrastrastructure in California.
CFEE Board Dues--$15K

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. 
Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

there's a movie that Grisman's daughter did about Grisman and Jerry and bluegrass that opens at the embarcadero on wednesday.  might be worth checking out.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Assume for now at least that the currently allocation stands pat.  Pretty crazy, huh?  Gotta hand it to Loretta Lynch.

Jeff

WOW!  This is really a surprise. Does this mean the current surcharge of 3 cent and 1 cent will NOT apply to direct access loads?  You would really make our day if your answer is yes.

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure

I have a copy of the settlement between the PUC and Edison if you want me to fax it to you.

Press Release

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

PR01:456
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
10/02/2001

GOVERNOR MAKES STATEMENT ON PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIONS 10/2/2001

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today made the following statement regarding PUC
actions:

"I applaud the mutual efforts of the California Public Utilities Commission
and Southern California Edison. Their settlement has protected the public
interest, and will allow the State's second largest utility to return to
financial health. I am pleased to hear the PUC's assurance that this can be
accomplished without a rate hike.

"In light of the agreement between the PUC and Edison, there is no need for
the Legislature to return next week for a special session. Therefore, I am
rescinding my call for the Third Extraordinary Session.

"In January, the Legislature passed AB 1X which authorized the State to
purchase power since our two largest utilities were brought to their
financial knees by runaway wholesale energy costs. Despite long odds, the
State was able to keep the lights on this summer and has spent approximately
$6.1 billion from the General Fund and $5 billion from the DWR Power Fund
doing so. AB 1X envisioned the sale of revenue bonds to repay the General
Fund with interest.

"The Public Utilities Commission's refusal today to adopt the rate agreement
necessary for the bonds to be sold was an irresponsible act. It creates
uncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the
General Fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty.
In fact, preliminary financial estimates show that State revenues are $1.1
billion short of budget projections.

FYI.

FYI.  Please see this notice indicating that any party wishing to comment on
the CPUC-SCE settlement must file same with the Federal Court in LA by 4:30
pm tomorrow, Wed. Oct. 3rd.   I am assuming that Enron will NOT file any
such comments, but wanted to pass along the deadline in case it was decided
to add our two cents.

have him call sue mara at 415.782.7802.

not really.  Is there someone in the Company that would talk to an ORA whacko about this?  I really don't know what the person wants to discuss....but I assume there's someone who deals with the public's inquiries about stuff...

come on, you're kidding, right?

Jeff - a business question: 

An ORA staffer is looking for a contact at Enron regulatory to talk about this direct access billing situation between PG&E, Enron, and Amway.  

who may I contact? 

Much happened yesterday--wow!--and at least for now, it appears that Loretta has let the Legislature off the hook--appears that the PUC is still a fairly potent institution.
But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved.
Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant.
As such, we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 11:30.

Best,
Jeff

No rush.  Whenever it's convenient for you.  Just let me know, and let me when you need the check  and for how much.

Kisses,
Jeff

Thanks.  Interesting.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%	
Innovative	30.8%	35.7%	24.6%	8.9%

Ethical	17.0%	45.1%	28.1%	9.8%	
Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2%	
Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Thanks.  I have to clear with Calger first.  Also left a message with Kean re: same.  May be that we give the idea to the large customers and they run with it so no fingerprints on our part.  I'm going to sketch out a proposal and pass it around for people to swipe at.  I'm for severing IF Riordan loses (you think he can win?).

You going to the Astros/Giants game tonite.  Hopefully they'll actually throw a strike to Bonds tonite.

Take another run at core/non-core...why not?  Would Lincoln turn over in his grave if we voluntarily severed California from the Union?

Am I reading this right?  The gas contracts are $5B out of the money (from CA's perspective)?  Are they straight gas deals?

Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald

<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>
 
 
At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had "arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads." Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a "leader" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's "command" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
"inescapable web of mutuality" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the "laissez faire" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate "captain."   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely,

Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International. 
"We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." 
Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. 
Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. 
The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. 
Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. 
"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." 
Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. 
Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." 
"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." 
Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. 
     
Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. 
Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. 
The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. 
"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. 
The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. 
Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. 
     
Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. 
The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. 
The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 

Thank you Robert for pointing that out.  I think there is/will be an opportunity--if we can ever get paid, and if we can ever comfortable from a credit standpoint--and my apologies for not having flagged that sooner.  Too many balls.........in the air.

Best,
Jeff

Article 2, Section 2.4 of the recent Settlement Agreement between SCE and CPUC states that SCE intends to apply to the CPUC for approval  to incur up to $250 million (recoverable in a tracking account) to acquire financial instruments intended to hedge fuel cost risks associated with its URG and QF contracts.  Any commercial opportunities there?

Don't hate me for sending a note.  What do you think?
"California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
"Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."

Attached is a draft agenda for tomorrow's meeting.  If there's anything we've missed, we can amend the agenda prior to starting tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff

The writer fails of course to mention that Clinton (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time.

Listening to the Edison call w/investors
Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02.
My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims.
Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.

Great.  Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.  You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?  I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.  I'm thinking that I may want to attend.  Thanks.

Probing the 'palace coup' 
Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. 
September 26, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. 
The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." 
Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. 
The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. 
Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. 
"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. 
The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. 
"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. 
Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. 
"It was an emergency," Fishman said. 
"We had to take action.'' 
What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. 
"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. 
"All hell broke loose.'' 
Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. 
"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. 
Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. 
In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. 
The generators got their way. 
The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. 
Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. 
They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. 
What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. 
Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. 
Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. 
"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. 
With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. 
"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." 
Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. 
Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. 
Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. 
Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. 
"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." 
Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. 
"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. 
"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." 
The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. 
James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. 
"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. 
"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." 
What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. 
"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

 

We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.  I can dig it up if you'd like.

Sue and Jeff --

I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.

My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?

Thanks.

Sounds good.

I suggest a "blind draw" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf,  and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week! 

Is there any question?  I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.  As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.
 
Best,
Jeff
 

Are you playing golf?  And if yes, what's the game and wager???

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"

State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

 

Michael,

The Senate Rules Committee hearing re Enron's contempt is set for tomorrow
morning at 9:00 a.m., Thurs., Sept 13.

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.

"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

FYI. Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....

PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal
Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.
SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.

With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.

Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.

Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."

Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.

Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.

And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.

For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.

Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as "nonexistent."

But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.

Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."

A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.

Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.

She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."

"Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."

Critics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.

Insisting on Independence

Accounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.

Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.

Lynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.

Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.

The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.

Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.

It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.

"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.

At her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.

Edison, PUC Started Secret Talks

Edison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.

But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.

The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."

Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.

Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with Edison.

"If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."

For several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.

On Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.

That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.

Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.

"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.

While those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.

The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.

Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.

The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.

The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.

But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.

Commissioners Praise Lynch

In Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.

"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.

Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.

"She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.

"I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

Dear Everyone,
 
I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.  It's a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate path that the owner doesn't advertise or even publish the address on the web.  Of course, it's not so homey that you can't get a drink, and it's close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there regularly.  For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn't all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my act this year.  Here are the details:

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 
This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 
In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 
Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 
But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 
As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 
Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 
Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 
Duress alleged
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 
"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 
Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 
"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 
"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 
Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 
Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 
He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 
The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.
Willingness to deal
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 
The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 
Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 
For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 
Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 
Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 
The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 
Sempra says contract fair
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 
San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 
Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 
"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 
White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 
"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 
Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 
The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 
Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 
"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 
A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 
In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 
Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 
Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 
Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 
The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 
The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 
Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 
"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 
Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 
Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 
Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 
"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 
The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 
The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 
Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 
Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

Just wanted to make sure that you have seen the announcement about the move, the meeting (on the 18th) they're having to explain and the brief description.  If not, let me know and I'll fax it to you.  And unless you have any objections, I'm seriously considering attending the meeting, since this has been one of the biggest problems we've had in the gas industry in California.  Let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.  Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless Steve and Rick have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for Enron (even in California!).  Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....

Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.  And holy moly, sounds like you and Christi are going to be extremely busy at FERC.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks for the response.  I think that I've got it cleared up.  I'm assuming that the time for our case write is "the present," i.e., September 2001.  If I've got that wrong, let me know.

I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.  Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.  And what about those 9-ers?

So did I!!  Thank you for the check - I appreciate it.  I was actually kind
of hoping you wouldn't want it!  It is such great wine and I did not expect
her to give me the 50% off or I would have bought more!  When would you be
around to pick up your other wine?  I don't want to order it and have it
sitting in our clean garage!  Also the check you sent for golf was too much
because you guys walked and did not take a cart.  You should have paid $80 -
so you have an $80 credit toward wine.

Miss you guys

how we doing on the one-pager?

 << Message: Sept. 13 Sen. Rules Cmte hearing >> 

Greetings.  Heard that Barry might in California this week?  Someone mentioned there may be attempts to meet with DWR.  Just checking, since DWR seems to be radioactive these days.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  In case you hadn't heard, the " bailout" that Edison struck with the California PUC would allow Edison to spend up to $250MM "to hedge fuel cost risks associated with SCE's Utility Retained Generation and QF and interutility contracts."

I would bet that we'll be there.  I'll bring my check book.  Is the 97 cab $32 retail?  If it is, it's worth it. 

With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the cake.  But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.

We'll see you Sunday!

Kisses,
Jeff

No I was just glad she was so generous and I am hoping that that will
continue!

I will order the wine tomorrow if you really will be by on Sunday.  I can
only have 2 cases delivered at a time.  So I'll get the Coastal first.  It
comes to $152.74 (less $80) = $72.74

The 97 cab will be $193.50
Total = $266.24

Great Niner game - sorry about your Giants - I was rooting for them!

Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?
When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. 
All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. 
When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. 
Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. 
At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. 
Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. 
Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. 
A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. 
That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. 
By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. 
Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. 
Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.

Power providers cry foul over fees 
State is accused of improper billing 
Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. 
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. 
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. 
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. 
"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. 
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. 
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. 
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. 
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. 
"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. 
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. 
"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. 
"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." 
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. 
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. 
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. 
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. 
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. 
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. 
Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO. 

Dear Ms DSL:

Looks like no DWR meeting this week.  Thanks for the tip.

Best,
Jeff

Oh, they're trying alright...but we have conflict with the consultant they've hired.  I'll fill you in another time.  (DWR is radioactive, though, and we shouldn't be doing any deals with them right now.)

sounds like it was a false tip!  

Dear Ms DSL:

Looks like no DWR meeting this week.  Thanks for the tip.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

de nada

Fab, thanks!

Let me know it this works, or if you need anything else.

Fallout in California
 

PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC

The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors

The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis

California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California

 

Since the bills that passed are all Burton/Senate bills, it may be the case that a deal has been cut at the leadership level involving 78 and the other energy-related bills (SB 18 in particular). Scott, Hedy, Bev---Can you do a bit of checking to see if this is the case?  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

SBX2 78 (Polanco) passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee on a
party line vote as amended.  I faxed the amendments to Houston and San
Francisco.

SBX2 39 (Speier), which grants the CPUC broad authority over generation
facilities, passed out of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability
Committee.

SBX2 18 (Burton), which establishes a dedicated rate component, passed out
of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.

SBX2 85 (Burton), which prevents the CPUC from adopting rate hikes up to or
above levels in effect prior to the imposition of 10% rate reduction, passed
out of the Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.

FYI.

CLECA, CIU and the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group have also come out wi=
th all guns blazing against the draft decision dealing with the DWR revenue=
 requirement.  They decry the lack of hearings, state that there are fundam=
ental untruths in the decision and conclude that, "The DWR has made it clea=

See your email re: contract/DA fix.  I'm in office.  Jeff

Mike Day and I talked.  Mike agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

yes.

A  DURING THE BREAK SEMINAR ON "UPDATING YOUR RESUME"

WHEN: Tuesday and Wednesday 10/9 or 10/10 from 7:30 P.M. to 8:15 P.M.

WHERE: Career Center conference room S420.

WHAT: I will cover some strategies to use when writing a resume and how to position yourself on a resume, so you are marketing what you want to do in the future, versus selling your previous jobs and companies. Limited seating. No need to reply just show up.

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

a legal memo follows

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.  Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering.  And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot.

This invitation is only going to energy industry executives, although there
is a possibility a few other Texas companies might be included.

Expect a call from Jeff Miller encouraging you to support attending when
asked by your client/company.

Hope to see you in Houston on the 29th.

Attached are EPUC's comments opposing the draft decision.  They argue that, "The DD implicitly overstates the Commission's obligation under these provisions and, consequently, risks the public interest.  While the Commission must assure recovery of the costs incurred by DWR, the statute does not require the Commission to assure full recovery of a fixed value in the face of variable assumptions.  Failing to address these variables could lead to unnecessary rate increases and further injury to the state's economy.  Moreover, while the Commission must adopt a "stop gap" allocation of DWR costs among utilities to determine who will make the payments, there is statutory requirement or practical  need for a final, absolute allocation to be adopted before a more careful examination can be made."
 
EPUC concludes by saying that it, "urges the Commission to tailor narrowly its decision adopting a DWR revenue requirement.  The Commission should adopt a mechanism, as described herein, that would limit or eliminate the difference between DWR actual costs and utility remittances.  The Commission should also adopt only an interim inter-utility allocation, to be reconciled with a final methodology pending a careful and thorough examination of cost responsibility."

FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . 
The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. 
"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. 
In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. 
"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. 
"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. 
FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. 
The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. 
"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said. 
 
     Contracting With Affiliates 
   
At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. 
California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. 
The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. 
The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. 
But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." 
The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. 
From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. 
Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power. 
 
     Improper Communications Seen 
   
Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. 
Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. 
Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. 
Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. 
Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. 
El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. 
The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. 
However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court. 

Thanks.  Any word yet on how well Jim's crushing the arguments of the monopolists in DC?

Agree-i will forward

Below is a summary of the events which have been occurring since last week's
meeting between the UDCs and ESPs re the implementation of the suspension of
direct access:

1. On October 3rd, a small working group comprised of representatives of the
three UDCs, Enron, Commonwealth and UC/CSU had a conference call to discuss
the filing of a joint proposal on the numerous issues surrounding the
implementation of the suspension of direct access.  While SCE was
represented on the call, it was clear that they were not interested in a
joint proposal and would file their own plan.  On the call, drafting
assignments were divvied up and another call was scheduled for Tuesday the
9th.

2.  On October 4h (as directed by the decision suspending DA), the UDCs
submitted letters to the Energy Division on their progress in implementing
the suspension.  PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set
forth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the
ESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the
ESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE
states that "SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001." The
submittal also states that "SCE will not process connect DASRs for service
accounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001."

3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,
Commonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the
ESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,
they would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)
which proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not
stated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.

4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end
of the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.

FYI.  Utility recent submissions to PUC regarding DASR process under 09.20.01 DA suspension.

Best,
Jeff
Below is a copy of the letter that SCE sent to the Energy Division last
Thursday.

well?  Thanks.

The number to Conference Room EB 751 is (713) 345-4032  - - Jeff,  you should dial the conference room directly.  Thanks!

Love to go to lunch.  Maybe Friday?  If not Friday, let's try next week.  

Hi Jeff,

As you know, a draft decision was issued a few days ago by ALJ Pulsiver regarding the DWR revenue requirement.  Attached are TURN's comments.  The introduction gives a cogent summary of the consumer group's view of DWR's demands:
 
"TURN continues to believe that CDWR has grossly inflated its revenue requirement by billions of dollars through the use of extremely high gas prices and ridiculously high ancillary service costs that are unrelated to current market conditions.  We understand that CDWR has the right under the Water Code to completely ignore consumer interests, recognize that it has done so in this case, and have come to expect that the Department will continue to do so.  CDWR, not the Commission, is the cause of a revenue requirement that is probably bloated by as much as $2 billion of unnecessary costs."
 
TURN also concludes that the Draft Decision places too much of a burden on PG&E and advocates that the "Commission should also adopt TURN's weighted load method of allocating ancillary services among utilities so that PG&E's extensive self-provision of ancillary services is not siphoned off to benefit other utilities."
Its suggested rates are shown on the following table:

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.'' 

keep up the good work!  Sue's got it covered.  But I'll be there soon enough.  You know, I just received this note.  Wonder if something's wrong with the network.

Best,
Jeff

always happy to oblige!  Shouldn't you be in Houston today???  Your absence is conspicuous (at least to me!)

PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. 
Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. 
The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. 
The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. 
The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. 
It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. 
EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM 
One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. 
Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. 
The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. 
PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. 
But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. 
Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. 
Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 
'FIRE SALE PRICES' 
"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. 
"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. 
Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. 
PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. 
The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. 
They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. 
The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. 
SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.

Thanks very much for dinner, the guacamole and the company.  I left you a check for the truck window work on the kitchen counter.

(That was the best dinner I've ever had in my entire life!  kidding! :)  )

Hope that you're not getting beat up by your bomb-throwing colleagues.

Best,
Jeff

Here's my take.  Slash away at will.  Sue, saw your notes, but didn't try to incorporate.  You should add anything I've missed, got wrong, etc.  Pulled it together quickly.  Hope there aren't too many errors.  And hope it helps.

Best,
Jeff

 

Sounds like a good outcome.  Thanks.

Jeff

I spoke with Ken Smith about his work with Enron.  His monthly retainer ends the end of October, and he has agreed (very happily) to be available as needed going forward on an hourly basis ($160/hour).  To make it easiest, we have agreed that he can do up to five hours of work a month without any prior authorization from me -- this should make it as easy as possible for the entire team to be able to use him as needed.  If a project arises that will consume more time, he will contact me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
kd

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

Best,
Jeff

FYI
Steve --

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

Jim

I spoke with Mary Lynne today, and she said that once upon a time (after the PX expired) we filed something asking the CPUC to make the DJ index a substitute for the PX credit.  Does this ring a bell?  And the more important question -- did we ever withdraw that request?  Thanks.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

deepthroat is rather provocative, don't you think?

Hey, whatever you're doing, keep it up!  I don't know how you moved the stock from 24 to 37, and I don't care.  Keep it up!

California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says
Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. 
The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. 
Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' 
Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. 
The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. 
Davis `Willing to Discuss' 
``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. 
Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. 
Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' 
The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. 
`A Blank Check' 
Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. 
``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. 
The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. 
``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. 
The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. 
Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. 
No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.'' 

FYI.

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January. 

Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. 
"That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

Thanks very much again for getting the truck window fixed.  I left a check on the kitchen counter.

Best,
Jeff

What's your zip at home in Napa?

Steve:  the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.  Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and Edison got.  The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave. basis.  If there's anything else you need, let me know.  This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.

Best,
Jeff

don't worry about it.  i'm just sending the check now.  whenever you get the wine is fine.  and thanks again for doing it.

94558.  And your wine will not be here until next Thursday!  I was late
sending it in!  Sorry,

What's your zip at home in Napa?

Yes.  And she handed out last time's mid-term.  It was take home at that time, though.  It's open book; we have the whole time, but she said it should take about 90 minutes (which means that it will take me the whole time).  You want me to fax it to you?  Check the website first. It may be posted there.

Hey Jeff,

I had to miss last night's class, as you may have
noticed.  Were there any notes, handouts, sample
questions, etc for next week's exam?

Thanks,

JT

I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  Your a good lawyer; do you think he can end run the Legislature and the PUC and put the rate agreement in place?  The plot continues to thicken, that's for sure.

given the mess out here, and how long it's been going on, howzabout "deep therapy?"

how about deep pocket??  you're too cute! :-) kd

deepthroat is rather provocative, don't you think?

Hey, whatever you're doing, keep it up!  I don't know how you moved the stock from 24 to 37, and I don't care.  Keep it up!

Best,
Jeff

so YOU'RE the unnamed source.  Should we call you Deepthroat?  :-) kd

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

FYI.  Unless I hear from you, I'm telling Hap that it's fine.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.

I should have known.  You're so politically correct.  Did I tell you we now have an office goldfish?  Steve has offered to kick in $5 toward fish food if it lives a week.  

Talked to Joan Kradin yesterday.  We're still negotiating a small retainer for November/December.  She said to say "hi" to you, and Ken Smith sang your praises, too.

Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.  
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ? 
 
regards, BT 

FYI.  Edison's filing for approval to hedge power up to $250MM.  If you'd like to get in front of Edison's CFO on this. Let me know.

Can you forward the decision regarding Davis' contract grab that came on the call the other day?  Thanks.

Jeff

In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.

Best,
Jeff

	Our best information is that the CPUC will NOT VOTE on direct access tomorrow, but will continue the meeting to another date and time.  Will let you know when we know the new date for the meeting.

FYI. Put another call into Bloom.  I'm sure he'll get back to me soon, but you know how busy these important lawyers are...

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is "doable," but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more.
Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. 
At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
"There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. 
SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
"If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.

Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks.

Edison pact could point way for PG&E 
The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. 
It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. 
The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. 
Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. 
One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. 
From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. 
It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. 
"It's definitely ambiguously worded," said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. 
"There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," Linsey said. 
The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. 
In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. 
And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. 
About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. 
Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. 
The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. 
Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. 
"In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. 
But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. 
No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? 
Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. 
The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. 
"People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" 
The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. 
That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. 
They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. 
"They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. 
For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. 
PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. 
"I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. 
A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. 
Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. 
"We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. 
Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. 
Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. 
At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. 
It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. 
"It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." 
In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.

Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, comments, etc.?

Best,
Jeff

All,

I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 "RAP" case three years ago.  The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted.  Therefore, we don't have to worry about it. If we like the idea, we would have to find a way to propose it anew -- if we don't like the idea, we just fail to bring it up again.

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

Best,
Jeff

FYI
Steve --

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

Jim

I spoke with Mary Lynne today, and she said that once upon a time (after the PX expired) we filed something asking the CPUC to make the DJ index a substitute for the PX credit.  Does this ring a bell?  And the more important question -- did we ever withdraw that request?  Thanks.

Steve
I haven't opened these, but let me know if this is the stuff.

Jeff

I'll have folks get those and forward them. Be back to you soon.

Jeff

I don't believe these are what I am looking for.  The Decision references Exhibits 14, 18, and 38 most frequently, but also Exhibits 9 and 26.  I do not see those titles or labels on any of these documents, and the descriptions of their contents in the Decision indicate to me that these aren't the Exhibits.

I think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts?

By the way.  I have gotten positive responses from most of the biomass guys in PG&E territory.  Covanta, Wheelabrator and Burney have all indicated that they would likely bid in their bio assets if this structure were available.  Unfortunately all of these are PG&E QFs.

Mike

FYI. Put another call into Bloom.  I'm sure he'll get back to me soon, but you know how busy these important lawyers are...

Best,
Jeff

Thank you.

You've probably already received a copy by now, but here it is just in case.

The ALJ issued his initial decision on the CPUC complaint case today.  As was widely expected, he found that El Paso and its merchant affiliate, El Paso Merchant, were guilty of affiliate abuse.  However, he did not find clear evidence that they were exercising market power.

The ID is attached.

Hi Doug:
Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the PUC.  Must be a relief. 

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?  Appreciate your insights.

AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!  What next?

Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

Thanks for the reply.  Agree the settlement is not nearly all that it could have been, but sure beats what we've got, it seems. If there's something you think that we can do to help in the GCIM case, please let me know.

Best,
Jeff

We went into the FERC proceeding believing that the Chief ALJ was not
likely to give us a good decision.  During the course of the proceeding, we
convinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in
our favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso
Merchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our
position, the judge ruled that it was "not at all clear" that El Paso
exercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the
Commission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it
never will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,
including the "protected material", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On
some level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is
the judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation
settlement discussions that he was "an asshole".  The ironic part of the
decision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the
market in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be
difficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the
market as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply
failed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact
that they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was
utilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.
Go figure.

I am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas
tailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least
considering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are
reasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices
that took place last December.   Having said that we are having a hell of a
time in the GCIM simply trying to investigate what really happened.
SoCalGas latest excuse for not giving us info is that we will "competitors"
with them (as a result of the filed rate litigation) for gas hedges.  I
must have misunderstood; I did not realize there was a limited supply of
hedges available and that there was competition for those "available"
hedges.   Anytime Enron wants to help on these GCIM issues, we would
welcome it--might make you look less like a Texas robber baron.

I said on this AM's call that today is the deadline for Davis to sign or veto bills.
That was not entirely correct.
That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills.
The bill in question (SB18XX--Burton) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session.
Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline.
Davis has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides.
We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session.
Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.

Best,
Jeff

It's safer there.

Jeff/Sue--I think that since Ms. Mara has now been identified as a bonified Republican (she does get mailings from the Republican party after all), she needs to attend!

FYI.  I don't know if this means that Sue and I both get a ticket, or if there's only one.  If someone from Houston--or another office--is interested, we'd be happy to accommodate.  Otherwise, I'm sure that we'll take full advantage of the opporunity.  Just let us know.

Dear CMTA Members: 

The California Manufacturers & Technology Association is hosting a major 
foreign policy and international trade speech by President George Bush! 
President Bush is making the stop as he travels to China on a two-day state 
visit and the White House asked us just yesterday to host the event. 

?       Sacramento Memorial Auditorium 
?       11:00 am to noon 
?       October 17th, 2001 

?       Yes, that's next Wednesday! 

As a valued CMTA member, a complimentary ticket has been reserved for you or 
another employee of your company. 

BUT YOU MUST RSVP WITH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER to Geri Royer at 
916-498-3330 or groyer@cmta.net by 4:00pm (PDT), October 12th, 2001. 

Please take advantage of this opportunity that your CMTA membership affords 
you. 

If you would like to come in the night of October 16, we have held a block 
of rooms at the Sacramento Hyatt Regency Hotel (916/443-1234) at a rate of 
$140 night.  Just ask to reserve your room under the CMTA block. 
Reservations must also be made by October 12 to guarantee this rate. 

This is a great opportunity to support the President and send him off on his 
first foreign trip since the terrorist attacks on September 11. 

As you know, security will be tight so there cannot be any exceptions on the 
October 12, 4:00pm (PDT) RSVP DEADLINE. 

We hope to hear back from you quickly and look forward to seeing you in 
Sacramento next Wednesday. 

Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.

* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few
weeks ? but probably not in time for the Q3 results release though.
* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst.

Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.

Were you on call this morning?  It was pretty interesting.  If you weren't on, I'd like to discuss a couple of topics that came up.

Best,
Jeff

No.  Although the lack of a concrete decision is a "decision" - just not one we like.  Our goal is to get this dealt with by end of November.

Jim

I believe we are ok for now.  Do we have any indication of when the CPUC will make some decisions on the CTC methodology?  

Mary Lynne -

Do you need anything on this?

Jim

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit ("market" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called "top-down" and "bottom-up"), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped "adjusting" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

I frankly have put NO creadance into their timeline.   Until the investment banks / commercial banks get in and assess whether there is an exit financing that is sufficient to take out the "just pay me nows" they are nowhere.   This will drag out.  The capital markets could not be more choppy to launch this discussions than right now.

Greetings:
Could I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas Accord until 2005?  You think they'll approve?  When are comments due?  We want to support you.

Best,
Jeff

Yeah.  Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in finance tomorrow nite. Sigh...

Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax.

I thought the whole weekend was a total blast.  It was great having both of
you there!!  I think every one had a very good time. There is no possible
way that we could have done anything more in one weekend.  Pumpkin carving,
abalone, piano roles, bluegrass, good meals, monopoly, scrabble and then the
most incredible weather I have ever had up there!!

FYI.  Update on windfall profits bills.

ABX2 2 (Corbett) - (windfall profits) was just amended on the Assembly
floor.  The amendments make the bill revenue neutral, among other things,
which makes it a simple majority vote bill. The bill could be heard by the
full Assembly as early as Thursday.

ABX2 65 (Cardoza) - (market manipulation) was just amended on the Assembly
floor.  The amendments remove the opposition of every entity except the
generators and marketers.  The bill could be heard by the full Assembly as
early as Thursday.

This work for you?  Lemme know.

Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.

October 11, 2001
Commentary
Even Pacifists Must
Support This War

By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."

Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.

Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.

I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months.
But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.

It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.

Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.

This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.

In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."

Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.

In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.

And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?

Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.

But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent.
Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.

What do you think about this?  It seems to me that, while I don't at this
point vote either way, there is another factor in the equation that I don't
see mentioned.  What if you also  hypothesize that those identified people
are going to die anyway?  We have pretty good evidence that some of the
people on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania were thinking this way.

Wait.  You mean that the first time you've seen John Wayne in a movie, or John Wayne being spooky?

That was the first time I saw him.  He's a little strange.

FYI.  Some interesting tid-bits from CMTA.
 
The CMTA Fall Conference scheduled for 
October 30 - November 2 has been canceled.

Legislative Weekly 
October 15, 2001 
Issue 40, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento

ECONOMIC SUMMIT 

In the wake of repeated economic blows on the state's business community and announcements of losses, layoffs and declining tax revenues, the Governor has stated his intention to hold an Economic Summit in early November with business and labor leaders, and professional economists to identify and discuss measures to stimulate California's economy.   The date and participants will be announced this week.  Governor Davis is also considering the possibility of calling a Special Legislative Session to enact such measures immediately.   In an effort to avoid or minimize a looming State budget deficit, the Department of Finance has instructed state agencies to cut their budgets by 15%. 

CMTA's members are devising a priority list of policies that should be adopted to help mitigate the effects of the international economic cooling and hopefully, stave-off recession in this state. 

POWER AUTHORITY MEETING 

Renewables and the Power Authority 
At an October 5 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) meeting in San Francisco, Chairman David Freeman acknowledged that renewable peaking capacity may comprise a significant portion of the 15 percent reserve the Authority expects to establish to prevent future price spikes in the cost of electricity. 

Freeman indicated that the Authority has received proposals for 18,000 MW in peaker capacity, which have been evaluated and winnowed down to 3,000 MW.  While commitments to build these peaker facilities have not yet been formalized, the Power Authority is moving forward with proposals for a few hundred renewable megawatts. 

Freeman also indicated that at least two state biomass plants are at risk of shutting down.  He believes that these plants should continue to run, despite the high costs associated with this market.  Power Authority staff has been asked to look at options to keep the plants operating, and to report back to the Power Authority. 

Board member Donald Vial expressed concern at the way in which the Power Authority is looking at the 15 percent reserve.  He believes that the reserve should be a working capacity margin used to phase out dirty plants and to move into, and to promote renewables. 

Board member John Stevens pointed out that the Power Authority has limited funding with which to purchase peaking capacity, and reminded the members that any plan must reasonably balance the costs associated with the generation capacity. 

Department of Water Resources Update 
The Power Authority also received a report from staff of the Department of Water Resources (DWR) who indicated that the Department is looking at load curtailment, renewables and new supplies that ideally are north of Path 15.  The Department believes it has been instrumental in keeping the spot market under control and minimizing the number of blackouts experienced this summer.  The Department also gave a great deal of credit to customers who have been instrumental in preventing blackouts through conservation. 

The Department will be updating its energy portfolio needs, and posting its information on its website at www.cers.water.ca.gov, sometime next week. 

Public Utilities Commission Natural Gas Infrastructure Report 
Barbara Hale, the Director of Strategic Planning at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) provided an update on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report that is due to the Power Authority by November 15.  Ms. Hale indicated that the PUC is working with the California Energy Commission (CEC) to evaluate the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure, including interstate pipelines, intrastate pipelines, local distribution, storage and backbone.  The PUC fully expects to have the report finalized and ready to deliver to the Power Authority by November 15. 

Preliminary findings indicate that in-ground storage is at 85 percent of capacity, a healthy margin to meet demands through the winter.  While there still is room to inject additional natural gas, the PUC is expecting a moderate winter with low gas demand. 
Chairman Freeman requested that the Natural Gas Infrastructure Report also include a forecast of natural gas availability from the lower 48 states and Canada, as well as whether or not California may depend on these sources to meet its needs. 

Board Member Vial questioned if the unbundling of storage has been successful.  Ms. Hale replied that the PUC is monitoring non-core use, and that preliminary findings indicate that many non-core customers are increasing their use of storage. 

Activities Related to Renewable Energy and Conservation 
Staff at the Power Authority reported that coordination between the PUC and the Power Authority is necessary to optimize conservation, energy efficiency, and demand response.  Specifically, the Power Authority is putting together a residential loan program; financing for efficiencies in public buildings; and, financing for small commercial and industrial upgrades.  The Power Authority believes that the small commercial and industrial market is the most under-served, due to the multiple demands on owners and their lack of resources.  The Power Authority is looking at ways to assist these customers in retrofitting their facilities. 

At the other end of the spectrum, the Power Authority believes that large commercial and industrial customers require the least assistance.  The Power Authority believes these customers are well served under current programs, but acknowledged that many of the demand response programs would be better coordinated under the administration of just one agency. 

Finally, Board Member Vial questioned why there has been little emphasis on real time pricing.  Power Authority staff agreed that real time pricing has not been a priority, and that the infrastructure to implement a real time pricing program does not currently exist.  Staff did indicate, however, that a recent $35 million investment in meters should help to incentivize these programs. 

Freeman concluded that it is important for the Power Authority to build on the momentum of conservation, and he acknowledged that technology finally is being priced such that real time pricing makes sense and likely will be an integral part of the Power Authority's program. 

Laura Doll Named as New Executive Director 
Laura Doll of Austin, Texas was approved as the Chief Executive Officer of the Power Authority at the October 5 Board meeting.  Most recently, Doll was Director of Customer Service for Grande Communications.  She also has held the positions of Senior Vice President for Planergy, as well as Chief Administrative Officer for Austin Energy.  Doll received a master of public affairs from the University of Texas at Austin, and a bachelor of arts degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute.  She will receive an annual salary of $200,000. 

COMPUTER RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY BILL VETOED (AGAIN) 

Governor Davis vetoed SB 147 by Senator Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey) on October 8.  The bill would have required employers to prepare and distribute by hard copy or electronically, a company monitoring policies and practices notice to each employee, to collect and verify their understanding of the notice, and file and maintain each employee's signed notice indefinitely.  This is the third time Senator Bowen's notice bill has been vetoed by the Governor and we hope that the bill has struck out. 

In his veto message, the governor referred to some of the concerns expressed by employers such as the need to monitor and control the use of company property for business purposes.  Also employers are potentially liable for the misuse of computers for improper purposes, such as sexual harassment, defamation and the like, so employers have a legitimate reason to monitor e-mail and computer files from time to time. 

The Governor said in closing his veto message, " I support reasonable privacy protections for employees in the workplace and my Administration proposed amendments which would carry out the intent of the bill without imposing undue regulatory burdens and potential legal exposure to businesses for doing what any employee should assume is the employer's right when they accept employment.  Senator Bowen rejected the proposed amendments. Thus, I must veto the bill a third time." 

This is a significant victory for employers.  The bill had the potential to open up Pandora's box on employee notices in the workplace by greatly expanding the scope, confirmation and tracking of notices.  CMTA applauds the Governor's veto of SB 147. 

GOVERNOR SIGNS MERCURY LEGISLATION 

Governor Davis has signed legislation to place new controls on products containing mercury.  SB 633 by Senator Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) places new controls on the disposal of appliance and vehicle components found to contain mercury. 

"I am signing this bill because it will help reduce the amount of mercury added to the environment by broken and discarded thermometers, novelty products, and by mercury-containing electrical switches that are not removed before junked vehicles are crushed or shredded," said Davis. 

SB 633 also bans the sale of new automobiles in California after January 1, 2005 that contain mercury electrical switches.

SB 71 (Burton D-San Francisco), Workers' Compensation, vetoed by the Governor.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Hi Glen:
Two things.  1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.  Just let me know.  2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?  I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.  I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.  And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  If you don't, know sweat.

Hi Evie:

check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)

Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.

Best,
Jeff

It was a great weekend. Mellow and raging at the same time. Thanks for 
coming. I'm glad you had a good time with everyone as well, including people 
you hadn't hung out with before. The abalone diving was great, even if I 
can't seem to get one now.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto 
the reef, so if you want to take that off the bill, that's fine, too.

I guess I'll see you tonight? The chefs are going to cook something up. By 
the way, we stopped in Graton yesterday and went to Scala (because Willow 
was closed, to my utter dismay). But Scala was damn good. We had the Dutton 
Pinot, which was great. I had a homemade ravioli that really hit the spot.

See you later,

Scott

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too 
selfish and evil for something so extreme to be effective more than 15% of 
the time. We have to go after those motherfuckers. And then be very 
responsible in the aftermath.

Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.

Best,
Jef

Jeff,

My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?

Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
them.

I am planning to attend the meeting and will send you a copy of the hand-outs. I am sorry I will not get an opportunity to meet you.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Best,

Just give a call when you get a chance.  I'm in.  415.782.7822.

call me when you have a moment - I visited with PG&E at their meeting in Napa...

We own 200,000 mmbtu/day of Baja capacity through Dec 2002 - I am not sure that they plan on rolling those agreements

FYI.  This should be interesting.

Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415)

Well, I guess my good friend Jerry's a little to busy these days.  I'm going to contact another lawyer who represents some big QFs and then loop back with Jerry.

Best,
Jeff

Jerry,

First off I would like to again commend you on your presentation yesterday.  It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.

As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Mike

Sounds like a plan.

I would suggest that we get a handle on the weather prior to committing.  If you remember it wasn't the warmest round of golf I've ever played. That said however, I'm in if you guys are in!
I'll play the cheap course.

Jim

I'm still in for golf if you are.  I'll bring some knitting in case you decide to bail...

There are several changes to the Direct Report meeting in November.  

First, the meeting will now conclude by 12:00 (noon) on Friday, November 9.  

Second, the activities portion of the trip will not be sponsored by Enron....each individual will be responsible (personally) for payment of activity of choice.  Most individuals either chose golf or horseback riding.....below is an estimate as to how much these activities will cost.

Golf:
Green Fees	(East/West Course)	$155.00/18 holes (Includes golf cart, use of practice balls, club care & storage)	
		(East/West Course)	$85.00/9 holes	(includes - same as above)	

		(Mountain Course)	$95.00/18 holes  (includes - same as above)
		(Mountain Course)	$50.00/9 holes	 (includes - same as above)		
Rentals:
Golf clubs with sleeve of balls	$55.00
Golf Shoes			$20.00

Horseback riding:		1hour		$25.00/person
				1hour pkg	$35.00/person (pkg includes shuttle ride to stables)
				2hour		$40.00/person
				2hour pkg	$50.00/person (pkg includes shuttle ride to stables)

				mini ride	(group only) $15.00/approximately 20 minutes
				

If you have an interest in the spa services that are available, please let me know and I will fax the spa list to you.

Please let me know ASAP which activity you choose so I can make the necessary arrangements. 

Thanks and please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Jeff:
 
1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't, as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however, have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be. More when that develops.
 
2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.
 
Hope you're safe and well.

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.

Thanks.  I think that's, well, a very aggressive view of how IOU debt and past and forward DWR costs are likely to be treated.  Be happy to discuss further if you like.

Jeff:

1.	Yes, very likely.

2.	415.421.4143

3.	I've been faced with implementing DA deals this last week.  I've heard
two marketers say that there will be no "exit fees" -- i.e., no
responsibility for utility debt or past or forward DWR costs.  Is this a
commonly held view (or fantasy) among marketers?

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

Jeff

I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 

Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state. 

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Cool.  If $150 don't cut it on the check, just let me know.  No sweat.  EVERYTHING is confidential.

YOur e-mails are like icebergs. Four lines of text, and then a whole mound 
of explanation underneath.

Cameron and I are talking about the golf. It's looking good, but I'm not yet 
sure what day. I'll e-mail you later with the final verdict.

And I got the check. Cheers.

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, "we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y. Disaster Relief fund."   Prior to the "no more money" decision, we also concluded that it made no sense to give individual donations.  So ... the following should a letter similar to the following should work:    

"Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in your October 24 reception.  Earlier this year, we made a corporate decision to direct our campaign dollars in California to the California Republican Party and not participate in individual races."  

Jeff: your thoughts??

Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.

Gary Ackerman was contacted by the campaign and agreed to meet with them on the 22nd. He will meet with Joe Ridota who is responsible for energy policy.  Gary would like some direction -- I'll be chatting with Gary on DA and let's do deregulation right.  ANything else you'd like to me pass along?

Greetings.  I can make it.  Is there a specific topic/agenda?

Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC.  I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12:30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation (e.g., drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition, payment within 10 days after CPUC approval, agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request, agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T&D charges, to name a few).   On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.

Any reason in particular that you're of this view?  (I'm hoping you'll say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.)

I like Saturday afternoon after your lesson, since we've got a wedding at 3 pm on Sunday to go to.

I have a mandolin lesson at 11am on Saturday, which I can't miss because Tom

I think Sanders has always thought that the Reliant deal offers sufficient protections.  Not sure that Kirby and Gibb agree.  We'll have to wait and see.

Best,

Thank goodness!  Sanders told me this morning we may not be going back to court for the protective order???

Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding

Let's get Bev or Hedy to deliver the message.  Great idea.  

We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.  If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.  Sound good?

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, "we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y. Disaster Relief fund."   Prior to the "no more money" decision, we also concluded that it made no sense to give individual donations.  So ... the following should a letter similar to the following should work:    

"Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in your October 24 reception.  Earlier this year, we made a corporate decision to direct our campaign dollars in California to the California Republican Party and not participate in individual races."  

Jeff: your thoughts??  

You got it. You're right, distribution lists are a challenge.  I'll make sure that you and these folks get on the list.  Hope all finds you well.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff - 

Thank you for this info - and for all of the hard work that you and the team are doing everyday.....

I know that the distribution lists are probably pretty hard to keep up with, but please make sure to include Evan Hughes, Murray O'Neill, Brenda Herod on  distribution lists for issues on this topic.

I would like to be on the distribution list for all of your California communication - and I think in large part, have been except for the message below.

Thank you!

Dan

  

?	In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
?	The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
?	Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
?	In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
?	Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
?	Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
?	The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
?	If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Hi Glen:
Good call this AM.  Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly.  However, Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow, and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on.  So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments.  As soon as I get something from Mike Day, I'll forward to you so you folks can review.

Best,
Jeff

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :

1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.

On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.

Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)

I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Best,

Hi Hilda:
I got an "out of office" reply from Elyse that mentions that you're the contact in her absense.  Please see the note below.

FYI.

yes, they already told Dan Douglas they would sign a stipulation that
replaced the MOU wit the Edison-CPUC settlement.  That is more than doable.
Dan is drafting the new stipulation now.  The stipulation commits SCE to pay
once the conditions precedent are met:  1. implementation of the settlement,
and 2. approval of the advice letter on prospective calculation of the
generation credit.  Our only current beef with that is that they exclude the
DWR charges.  Mike

Any reason in particular that you're of this view?  (I'm hoping you'll
say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.)

to replace Dede.

Might be able to do Sunday morning.  Eldon's going to check and see if there's a tee time.  Will report back as the news breaks.

FYI - Eldon has rehearsal/concerts on both Sat and Sun which means you
really can't play NVCC - however, there are certainly other places that you
could play - Silverado, Kennedy, etc.

I have a mandolin lesson at 11am on Saturday, which I can't miss because Tom

is teaching me less these days. That means I can be up in Napa for a 2 pm 
tee-off. Or, we can play on Sunday at 1 or so, after the first set of games?

Or earlier, if you want. How does that sound? Let me know.

Interesting.  

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."

Question 2: How hot is it down there?

Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer?

I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and new
years this year.  I really need to get certified for diving and the diving
there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all
PADI).  PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me.
So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing.  Then, if
you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying down
there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I think
Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So, you
might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
What do you think?

Speech apparently was not quite as sharp as recent ones, but heard the event overall was very good.

We didn't go.  Two commercial guys did.  If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

Hey--which one of you went to the Prez's speech today?  Did he do ok?  Any comments on energy policy?

Tee hee.  More questions to follow.  Can't wait for the answers....

Thank you for your prompt reply. I have taken the time to listen to all of
your concerns and have responded below appropriately. 

Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a
"desire" (something that, according to my buddhism class yesterday, would be
beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness). The desire,
however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in
diving locations during my honeymoon. Due to the limited amount of vacation
time I am alotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to
forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this
week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the
specified time to obtain the coveted certification. No, I am not interested
in getting certified in Monterey Bay. 

Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round. I
know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras. I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting
reliable travel guides and weather almanacs. 

Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it). I
have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, jessica, who
just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both
information and endorsements. Yes, Belizeis supposed to be very good also,
but the island we would be going to is practcally in Belize. Please refer to
a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date). 

I apprecieate your questions and coments and await your reply. 

Sincerely,

Cameron

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really

Question 2: How hot is it down there?

Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to

diving
there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all

if
you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying

there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I
think
Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So,
you
might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
What do you think?

interesting.  thanks.

You're right about the secondary market.  The Commission imposes a 120%
limit on everyone.  The problem is, this is unenforceable.  Marketers will
just bundle transportation with commodity and inflate the commodity price to
extract the transportation premium.  This happened a few ago on the
interstates when FERC tried the same thing.

FYI.  Latest info is that large customers, some QF cogens, independent storage companies, and perhaps PG&E, will be filing separate comments supporting the Bilas decision to adopt the settlement.

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :

1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.

On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.

Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)

I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

Mark, IGS.

Mike Day's firm could do it, but they'll charge for the adminstrative costs necessary to file (we don't have the support necessary to file).  Does that work?  If so, I'll need to contact Mike promptly so they can get prepared to do the filing.  No word yet as to whether SoCalGas will support.

Jeff,

Two questions.  Any word as to whether or not SoCal has taken a definite position?  Secondly, assuming Transwestern files its own comments in support of the PD, could you help us make the filing?  Greg Porter, our attorney is drafting the comments today however we may not have it ready until tomorrow.  Thanks.

Mark, IGS.

PS  The cost of having Day's firm file for you folks wouldn't be more than $100-200.

Thanks.  Sorry for the latest. Was on the road this morning.

Jeff,

In general, I agree with you that absent market power price caps are bad
policy.  In this case, I believe we have crafted the settlement (and the
decision reinforces those sections, in fact, the reduction of market
concentration limits from 40% to 30% goes even further in this regard), so
that market power will not be a problem.  I have phoned Mike Day and
suggested that he craft his comments to include the caveat about market
power, and he indicated that would not be a problem.  With that change I
don't think we object to including the comments on price caps.  I am still
getting approval from the various powers that be, but hope to get that
soon.

Michael

Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the
price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is
simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it
will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even
sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the
secondary market.)

Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision
based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.

But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been
on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy
and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that
it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on
record against them.

That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud
support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the
cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.
Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are
ill-advised?

Best,
Jeff

Hi Elyse:
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Best,
Jeff

in the package the information/data you are seeking.  Recognize that there 
were some corrections made on the stand by some of the witnesses.  I would 
recommend that you check the transcript for those corrections. 

        Also, Keith tells me you also wanted a copy of Exhibit #38.  Jim Hay

I will add you to next emails.  

Attached is the first of three emails with SDG&E's filing  updating the DWR
revenue requirements.   The following is an excerpt from our pleading.  In
the next email are scenarios that show DWR surcharge (cents per kWh for
system, large customers, and small customers)  under assumptions requested
by the ALJ.    

Thanks especially to Ed Fong, Mohamed Derbas, Bill Saxe, Mike Strong, Keith
Melville, and Jeff Parrot for key assistance in getting this filing out in
one-day. 

Based on this filing,  the Commission may (we have no Proposed Decision yet)
rule as soon as August 23 on an increase to SDG&E rates of approximately
3-cents to recover the updated DWR revenue requirements.  

If you have questions, please contact me, Lynn Van Wagenen, or Keith
Melville. 

Excerpt of SDG&E pleading: 

	On August 15, 2001, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wetzell issued an
"ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S RULING ON THE AUGUST 7, 2001 REVENUE REQUIREMENT
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES" directing San Diego Gas & Electric
Company (SDG&E) to produce updated estimates, including supporting analyses,
of the system average electric rate increases required based on the revised
revenue requirements determined by the Department of Water Resources' (DWR),
as set forth in the August 7, 2001 DWR communication to the California
Public Utilities Commission.   

This email contains the pleading, assumptions, and a summary.  The summary
is the accurate updated version.  

Cc:     Hay, James E. 
This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
its updates to Exhibit 18.

A Conference call to discuss any comments we may want to make on the CPUC's Proposed Decision in the GIR Proceeding has been scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2001 at 11:00 AM Houston/Omaha time and 9:00 AM California time.  The dial-in # is 1-877-795-3687 code: 350955.  In Houston, Conf. Rm. 1336 has been reserved for the call.  

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

Jesus, I'm on acid.  I meant Sunday morning.

Are you going to stay and play? It's very tempting. But I'd have to come up 
on Monday morning, However, that doesn't scare me at all.

Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.  The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  

No suspension of DA.
All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not.
Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.
Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.
The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.
Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.

We'll continue to scour the universe for it.

Those were helpful, still not the holy grail I am searching for.  Thanks.

Forgive my ignorance, but I'm assuming that "related party transactions" refers to the Fastow deals?

fyi...

Sue- 
FYI- we issued the attached release this morning. I know our govt affairs teams will have lots of questions and will probably be asked several questions.  Unfortunately, given the legal nature of this inquiry, we cannot say anything more than this at this time.  We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this.  Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning.  It would be a good idea for everyone to tune in, if possible (or review the playback later in the day.) 

I am also attaching a brief INTERNAL Q&A about the SEC request- just to give a little more information.

Thanks-
Meredith

	I'm sure you are on your call this a.m.

	Can you reverify the time and date of your conf calls, there is some confusion on the calls.

	Thanks!!!!!

I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.

The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  

To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.

In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:

Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.
Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.

Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  

A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.

Any thoughts?  

Best,
Jeff

CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS 
Friday, October 19, 2001
[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need." 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

10-ish percent.

hey....at the high point of direct access, how much of the load was off the system?

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.

Barry:

Good to meet you last week.  I'm out of the office until Monday, but will get on this as soon as I return.  Of this group, Dynegy is involved in the State Senate's investigation.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance. 

BT  

This is the last straw:

Peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue.  He then went on ad nauseum--and I mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world.  Unreal.

I told him that in exchange, we expected him to get rid of Bill Lockyear.

Richard:  He complained a little about Kirby.  I told him Kirby was worth his weight in gold.

Best,
Jeff

You get a hold of Bob Williams?

Hey, I was wrong. I went back and checked.  DA got as high as about 16% of total load in May 2000.  On January 1 (contracry to Herr Angelides' letter), DA was about 7.3% of load.  On February 1 it was 3.5%.

Best,
Jeff

this is true.  good point.

Yes, yes, but the CPA wants to build plants to fill that net short, so it's NOT good.

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that

FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.

congratulations.  just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed!

Vindication!  It just took the Commission a little while to see the
error of their ways.  Kudos to TURN!

Thanks for the news, Jeanne!

Mona

Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission
issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually
granted TURN's rehearing request in part.  The overall result is to
reduce
the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3
million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in
electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.
Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.

1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in
essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much
it
invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a
1998
forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year
forecast.
TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this
amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the
end
of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the
Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted
amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The
rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the
electric
distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject
to
refund.

2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric
distribution
capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.

3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was
reduced by $9.2 million.

4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to
justify
the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated
that
PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed
amount
by $7.9 million.

5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had
failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA
customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that
money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had
disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission
disallowed $20 million.

6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2
million as
funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which
they
had not received any benefits.           

I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.  We can hold off on that.  In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

The cost of materials includes the bridge, should I order redwood for the deck amd have it delivered?

Best wishes,

Jim D.

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a CEA thing.

FYI.  Please keep confidential and do not circulate.  This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.  Only the large customers will sign, however.  I'll forward the final when they've completed it	.  Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.

Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  

On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  

But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.

Best,
Jeff

Has anyone ever stopped to ask Loretta whether the letters are helpful or not?  Two things occur to me.  First, it is not becoming for a commissioner to be taking actions consistent with the urgings of industry -- particularly if you're a Democrat.  Second, it has always struck me that what she needs is some form of record support, not political pats on the back in one-page letters.  I am asking you these questions not judging the proposal to send a letter .... but I've never understood what they're supposed to do for her and I honestly would like to understand.

E

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry

CONFIDENTIAL. Please don't distribute.  Evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to Loretta.  I think it would be, but would be useful to have your/Loretta's views.
Let me know.

Thank you for your explanation.  Often I think too literally and narrowly
and forget about the importance of spin.  All the same, I think we should
know if Loretta appreciates the open support of evil industry or not...I'd
say it's worth a call.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Governor Chicken

10/22/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The two politicians who've arguably benefited most from the national focus =
on war are both Californians -- Congressman Gary Condit and Governor Gray D=
avis. Too bad Mr. Davis is finding he still can't avoid his own chickens co=
ming home to roost.=20
Only now are the folks in Sacramento learning that their Governor's "soluti=
on" to the energy crisis has been a political sham. A combination of collap=
sing budget revenues, foolish spending and bad credit ratings threatens to =
plunge the state into a full-fledged financial crisis.
Governor Davis's chickens left the roost back in May 2000, when California'=
s botched scheme to deregulate electric power encountered a wicked price bu=
bble. Wholesale prices, which had been deregulated, shot up, while retail p=
rices, which were still regulated, didn't budge. This mismatch, along with =
other factors, generated huge supply disruptions and a first-class energy c=
risis.=20
The obvious response would have been to let retail rates rise with the mark=
et price. Mr. Davis said so himself in his now infamous observation that if=
 he raised rates, the problem would be solved in 20 minutes. Mr. Davis pref=
erred to play the blame game, including a lot of whining that he had inheri=
ted the situation.=20
While the Governor complained, California's two largest utilities were push=
ed into insolvency and neighboring states endured the double whammy of havi=
ng their power sucked into California and seeing their electric rates shoot=
 up. Californians suffered through rolling blackouts.=20
Finally, this past January -- eight months after the energy crisis began --=
 the Governor responded: Retail rates were increased twice, and the state s=
tarted to purchase power directly from suppliers, using money from its gene=
ral fund. At the same time, the state negotiated contracts with suppliers a=
t prices that are now well above market prices and for terms as long as 20 =
years.=20
And then Mr. Davis got lucky. Although the forecast was for a summer of con=
tinued blackouts generated by a strong demand for power, the disaster faile=
d to materialize. Not only was the weather cooler than normal, but higher r=
ates produced immediate conservation; thus demand was moderate and power su=
fficient. Newsweek went out and hailed the Governor as a political Lazarus.=
=20
But now here come the chickens. It seems that almost one-quarter of Califor=
nia's budget revenues were provided by taxpayers with stock options and cap=
ital gains, mostly from Silicon Valley companies. When the dot-com industry=
 started to implode, so did revenue projections -- to $12 billion this year=
, down from $18 billion last year. And this was before September 11 and the=
 collapse in the Nasdaq market.=20
California would probably be able to absorb this revenue hit were it not fo=
r the still outstanding bills from the Governor's electric power fiasco. Co=
nsider the toll:=20
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for the $14 billion that the utilities =
owe to suppliers for power consumed before the state started buying electri=
city.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the $12.5 billion bond issue that Cal=
ifornia hopes to float to replenish the money borrowed from its general fun=
d.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to pay for those expensive, long-term contract=
s that the state negotiated.=20
-- Somebody is going to have to repay the bridge loan of $4.3 billion that =
California got from the banks hoping to underwrite the bond offering. (If t=
his loan is not repaid by November 1, its interest rate jumps to 7% from 4%=
, resulting in an extra $250,000 in interest payments a day.)=20
Whether these bills are ultimately assumed by ratepayers or taxpayers, or s=
ome combination of the two, the impact on California's economy and its budg=
et will be dreadful. Observers are estimating a budget deficit of almost $1=
0 billion for next year.=20
As for Governor Davis, the problems of the "previous administration" are no=
w his own. And Californians know it. A recent statewide poll showed that mo=
st voters preferred the former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan, the l=
eading Republican challenger to Mr. Davis, by several points.=20
The Governor's response to the ever-worsening economic situation has been t=
ypical. He complains. He vetoes a few spending bills. He announces a $5 mil=
lion campaign to persuade Californians to help the local economy by staying=
 in-state for their vacations. We expect to see a lot of chickens on surfbo=
ards.

Have you heard anything back on potential dates to meet.  I am in NY until
November 11th, so any date after that would be great!

Sorry you couldn't watch the movie last night - it was pretty funny.

Hope you are excited about the meat pie for dinner.  Won't that be a
treat???

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

Thanks very much for the update.

\Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.

Jeez, nice company.  Putting you up for 10 days at the Waldorf.  I love that neighborhood.  Anywho, I'll check those dates and get back to you.

You aren't supposed to be hungry.  Dinner won't be served until 10pm.  Be
hungry at 10.

We leave for NY on the 1st and return on the 11th.  Staying at the Waldorf
the entire time.

Three dates.  OK.  Wait.  How about two dates?  November 15th (any time) or
November 22nd  (any time)??

I think the menus will be good also.  I think my mom has had their food and
liked it too.

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change,
modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one
works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the
riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe
you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK,
of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the
event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other
stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

best,
Jeff

Have you heard anything back on potential dates to meet.  I am in NY
until
November 11th, so any date after that would be great!

Sorry you couldn't watch the movie last night - it was pretty funny.

Hope you are excited about the meat pie for dinner.  Won't that be a
treat???

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff

Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?

Best,
Jeff

Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?

Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

Great questions. Some brief responses. We can discuss further tomorrow.

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE "DISPATCHABLE."

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?
PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.)  IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING.

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE.  HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED.

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

YES.

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED.

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST.  THEY ARE A MYTH.  THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE.

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

THAT'S A GOOD THING.  AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS.

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.  AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF.  LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

Good work.  Who was Enron's negotiator in all of this?  GAC

Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes.
In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron.
This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions.
A story related to the deal is attached.
If you have any questions, just let me know.

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
"It took too long to bring this to resolution," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. "I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt." 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
"We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges," Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
"Let's hope cooler minds prevail," said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
"It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California," said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 

Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
"We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there," he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt "smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court." 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state. 

Here it is.  It's somewhat quick, but I don' t know what your timeline is (hopefully quick).  Let me know what you think (hope you don't mind that I modified your title).

Any word from Loretta re: whether a letter from big customers would help in the fight against tantrums from Angelides?

Guess who?  Me again.  You thought about having your guy Jack (who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group) go to the Governor and tell him to tell Angelides to knock it off and to back off?

Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?

Third, I should be able to get you something on our view of RTOs.

Best,
Jeff

dee-lish-ush dinner--the tart was especially yummy.  thanks very much.  by the way, was that a regular tart?

FYI.  Left him a message.  Will report back when we hook up.

Best,
Jeff

Thank you, O wise one.  I'm sure that Jack will thank you for preserving his fluids.

Jack IS pretty juicy....but we shouldn't waste his precious fluids on Peevish Angelides.

I think sending it directly to Loretta makes more sense....she's the one with the regulatory portfolio over the issue...and Phil's tantrum doesn't deserve the price of stamp, much less a direct response.

Dear folks:
Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see all of you very soon.  Be safe.

Best,
Jeff

that's really too bad, i hope you are still able to make it.  I am still
planning to go, but will definitely be riding only on Sunday and might drive
up on Saturday instead of on Friday.  Lu, I'll call you after I talk to Jeff
to confirm whether he's still going.
p

Hey guys--
It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
affected in the tragedy. 

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know. 

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.

I will get back to you by Wednesday. 

Madeleine

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:

Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight

Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?

Amy

thanks.

Jeff --

I'd leave the number blank for all parties to be discussed between the different parties.  Best way would be to have some Attachments for the amount that the companies can sign after everything else.  Don't want Dan Douglas to know the $$$ before Richard Sanders oks.

Jim

Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Best,

Jeff --

As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
QF power with short-term firm energy?

2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
energy from sources over which it may have less control?

3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
is the supply curve for replacement energy?

4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?

5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?

6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
the QF buyouts done to date)?

7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
procurement business?  If not, why not?

As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.

Talk to you tomorrow,

Tom

Tom:
Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.

Talked to Edison about getting a meeting with Craver.  They're going to get back to me. 

Best,
Jeff

Edison did not bring up the refund issue at all (doesn't mean that they won't, though).  Agree on the AB 1890 issue.  The clock stops in March of '02.

Best,
Jeff

Wes,

If Edison sticks to their plan, they will want to meet before November 7th.  They are wanting to discuss completely different issues than PG&E   To date, PG&E issues have been focused around the outcome of the FERC refund case. I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison's  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is "technically" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP's should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince "the regulators"  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.  

Will keep you posted.

Jim: FYI.

Is there someone on the California "Crisis" Team that can answer this question?

Nancy, when we went through our last big DASR emergency week before last, the question was raised as to what was the effective date of a DASR, e.g., is it midnight of the day that you've submitted it, or if the utility picks up the information from their file server at 5:00 p.m. (SoCal) is does that determine the effective date such that anything submitted later would have an effective date of the following day?  Could you give us some guidance on the right answer?  We used the pickup time of the utility, in which case we had to have all the SCE DASRs submitted by about 3:00 Houston time to give CSC the ability to key the data into their system and run their batch process prior to SCE's pickup time.

Bob
 
Robert D Gresch

To clarify below.  The 3:00 cutoff for SCE DASRs will not allow for 480 SCE accounts.  CSC has stated they could do about 120 in an hour.  I have indicated it below in a revision.   The 480 would apply to a group of DASRs from all utilities.  Additionally, CSC has stated that from 6:00 forward, the amounts shown below are guesses of what they can do, but there is a lack of certainty.
 
Robert D Gresch
08/31/2001 03:34 PM
Mark, per our conversations, these are the details of how much CSC can handled from a DASR bandwidth perspective, and what the utility and CSC deadlines are:

Central Time		DASR Ability		          UDC Pickup Deadline	
7:00 a.m.		1200
11:00 a.m.		960				Cutoff for EEMC
12:00 p.m.		840
1:00			720
2:00			600
3:00			480	(120 SCE)		Need to have SCE DASRs to CSC 
4:00 - 5:00		Batch Process Shutdown
5:00			200
6:00			70
7:00			50				5:00 Pacific for SCE

Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts?

What do you think about the % of load argument?  This is Sue's e-mail.  

Wanda

The new data are out from the CPUC.  Only reported as of 8/31/01.

 << File: DA Load as of 8-31-01.doc >> 

Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:

Total debt = 6.35 B
After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.
The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Wanda

Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.

I don't understand the netting that you are referring to.  Does it mean that they will pay negative ctc's up to some just and reasonable amount and anything above the j&r level will be paid out when all of the other people are paid.  How do they define the "ESP's share of the undercollection?"

I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Greetings:
Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

No, I don't think so.  Haley and Wil's vocabularies may expanded a bit, though.  Thanks again for  having them.  Very kind of you.

Jeff

Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.

Best,

Could you forward the gas daily article?  Thanks.

Jeff

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.

u still in DC? jeff

Could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the California Ds gets a copy to me and Sue (want to keep the family happy, don't you know).

Thanks a million.

Boy do we need the cash from that merger.  Please hurry.

Best,
Jeff

You know what is more recently?  Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.  

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff -  Throughput to Blythe has been averaging about 84% this year with peak flows of 99% in Jan and March.  In your sentence below, do you mean to ensure max vols through Blythe?  Typically, Topock averages higher throughput than Blythe.  Thanks for your help.

Lorraine

Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.

Best,
Jeff

Yes.  I called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details. So he's up to speed; but feel free to forward.
Best,
Jeff

Also, didn't want to put in the note, but I got the impression from Fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation.  But I think we should push it, if for no other reason than to keep the PUC out of it.

Jeff, thanks.  Can I forward to Mike Day?

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter
 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. 

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Circuit Breaker: Enron Dumps CFO Amid Conflict Questions

By Stephen Taub

Enron Corp. is set to replace CFO Andrew Fastow. As CFO.com reported in a
story earlier this week, Fastow's role in a limited partnership has raised
concerns about a conflict of interest. 

Fastow is succeeded by Jeff McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and
CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was
Enron's treasurer. He resigned that post in part because he disapproved of
Fastow's role in running two partnerships, according to The Wall Street
Journal. 

"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as
CFO," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO, in a statement. 

McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office
as CFO for the company's European operations. Upon returning to the United
States, McMahon assumed the post of EVP of finance and treasurer for Enron
Corp. In 2000, he was named president and COO of Enron Net Works, where he
focused on E-commerce activities. 

As reported on Friday, The Wall Street Journal said a limited partnership
organized by Fastow, who has been Enron's CFO since 1997, racked up millions
of dollars in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company. 

On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information regarding certain related party transactions. 

On October 16, Enron stunned Wall Street when it announced that it would
take a $1.01 billion after-tax charge for the September 30 quarter. 

Since the announcement, Enron's share price has more than halved. 

Fastow's dismissal seems to be an about-face for Enron. In a conference call
Tuesday, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and took steps to
assure that there was no conflict as Fastow played both roles. Enron has
since dissolved the partnerships. 

"Obviously, the board and even the lawyers and auditors realized that there
would be an apparent conflict of interest there and the board prescribed
certain methods for it to be dealt with ... so Enron would never be
compromised," Lay said in published accounts. "We are very concerned [at]
the way Andy's character has been loosely thrown about in certain articles,
as well as the company's reputation." 

Predictably, on Wednesday at least two law firms - Stull, Stull & Brody and
Bernstein Liebhard & Lifshitz, L.L.P - filed class-action suits against
Enron, Lay, Fastow, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief
executive who resigned in August. 

The suits allege that the defendants issued false and misleading information
that materially misstated the company's condition and prospects to the
investing public. Moreover, the suits argue that the company failed to
disclose material information necessary to make its prior statements not
misleading. 

The complaints charge that Enron issued a series of statements concerning
its business, financial results, and operations which failed to disclose,
among other things: 

* The company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining
demand for bandwidth, and the company's efforts to create a trading market
for bandwidth were not meeting with success, as many of the market
participants were not creditworthy. 

* The company's operating results were materially overstated, since Enron
failed to write down in a timely fashion the value of its investments with
certain limited partnerships - the partnerships that were managed by Fastow.

* Enron was failing to write down impaired assets on a timely basis in
accordance with GAAP.

Sorry about that.  I'll get back to you with some other dates.

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff

Jim:
Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.

Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?

Best,
Jeff

Sue -

Received your voice mail.  Having AReM only file is ok with me.  Spoke with Lamar Frazier - Jeremy sounds worried.  Let's make sure that the contract question is vetted with internal and external lawyers - agree not to give CPUC any info.

Thanks,

Jim

You ain't kidding.  Hope you and yours are OK, given the circumstances.  All the best.

*	About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
*	Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
*	Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
*	Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
*	Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

A press account and Davis' statement are attached.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- 

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility. 

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds. 

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday. 

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation." 

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt. 

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts. 

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy. 

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done." 

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school. 

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing. 

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders. 

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds. 

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks. 

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks. 

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal. 

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

I thought that might be the case.  Didn't want to be so bold as to bring it up, though.  You looked great with glasses.  You look great without them.  Thanks again for the email.

I took the plunge and got LASIK about a month ago. 
Amazing to be without glasses or contacts for the
first time in 20 years.  VERY convenient.  

Although some people tell me they miss the specs on
me.

How do the 13th or 20th of November work?

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

You see this?  What the hell is with Cramer?

    Date      October 25, 2001
    Time      07:00 AM - 08:00 AM
    Station   CNBC
    Location  Network
    Program   The Squawk Box

              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

                        # # #

Thanks.  Love to catch up on Tuesday when I get back, if that works for you.

Best,

Hey Jeff
Yep there were a lot of people.  The class seems a lot
more like an undergrad class: lecture style, one small
book,  only one exam-in class final, no name tags, no
attendance monitoring. Lecture seems to VERY closely
mirror the book. While the logistics look favorable
from a time perspective, I'm not sure how promising it
looks from a "wow" that was a great class perspective.
  

Class held from 6:00 til 8:30 ish, w/ a 5 min break
(we voted).
Hope you're havin fun on vacation!  Let me know if
you're going to go to this class, or want to catch up
on Tues durng break-
Courtney

Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Best,
Jeff 

Jeff, Just looking at teeing my a schedule.. any feedback from either/ both. 

BT 

I'll contact Lydia and you'll have materials well in advance of the meeting.

The 13th would work much better, preferably in the afternoon.  Please contact Lydia Cannon (713-853-4893) to get a specific time on my calendar.  Also, any specific Perfect company information beforehand would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brad

How do the 13th or 20th of November work?

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Hi Lydia:

Could you let me know what time in the afternoon of November 13th works with Brad's schedule?  Will need 60 minutes.  Thanks very much for your help.

It's going to be sometime in the afternoon on the 13th.

Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.

Best,
Jeff

Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a

Baldwin's secretary called.  He's going to check with DWR and get back to me tomorrow morning regarding whether Monday or Tuesday will work.

Greetings:
Unlucky you.  It's me again, calling about setting up a meeting with Ms Doll.  Any word?  Greatly appreciate your efforts.
 
Best,
Jeff

Yes, I have known her for quite some time.  She is the one who recommended me to Korn Ferry for the job that I have at Enron.  I will be happy to make the introduction.  Shall I make arrangements for a meeting in Pebble Beach???  
 
I'll give her a call when you say the word...Jean

Jean --
 
Laura Doll has been appointed head of the CA Power Authority.  Do you know her?  It would be good to have an introduction for Jeff Dasovich.
 
Jim

No problem.  No hurry.  Whenever you've got it ready is great.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

I apologize for the delay.  I am still waiting on a few pieces to complete the very generic presentations we discussed this morning.  As soon as it is somewhat together I will shoot you a copy.

Regards,

Dave

Jim:

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

We have a number yet for the call?

Best,
Jeff

Hi Bob:

Could you please leave on my voicemail the call-in number to discuss the meet and confer call that's happening with Edison?  When exactly is that meeting?  Is it California or Houston.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Speaking of dinners, Lizzie wants to come into the city and see us and have
dinner.  What nights do you have class Jeff?  I don't think we will plan it
until the first week of October.  At that point Tues and Wed are bad nights
for me.  Monday, Thursday work for you??

Let's try this.  It's all inter-related.  PG&E, the prehearing conference and our workout with Edison.  Can we have one call that you includes all who need to be involved?  (I'm thinking, Steffes, you, Tribolet, me. Mellencamp, Wanda, Sue). That make sense?

Let me know.  Easiest thing would  likely be to set up a call-in number (I'm mobile today).  Thanks alot.

The pleasure was all mine.  You did a fantastic job with the presentation (both developing and presenting it).  Likewise, it lifted my spirits in these challenging times to meet someone as talented (and fun!) as you.  Hope our paths cross again often.  Never hesitate to get in touch if there's anything I can do.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff: Thanks again for joining for the conference. I was actually very busy with folks there through the breakfast meeting Saturday am (had one particularly hostile attendee to that) and then on through Saturday afternoon- questions, questions, questions so I would say our attendance was definitely worthwhile. Your insight and provacative discussion provided an excellent framework for the business case we were trying to communicate. If I can ever be of any assistance to you, please feel free to call me. When I meet folks like you, it just reinforces my commitment to the great people we work with and the great company we work for. Thanks, Laurie

Thanks to all of you for your help with this.  Made my participation practically effortless, and more important, alot of fun.  Great job.

Actually, I'm travelling tomorrow.  If we could do it between 8 and 9:30 AM (PST), that would work.  Otherwise, I'll need to do Wednesday if possible.

Mr. Dasovich,

Bob Williams has asked me to schedule a conf. call regarding the November 7 Prehearing Conference.  Are you available tomorrow from 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. CST?  Thanks.

Jan

Horowitz never had a chance.

Sue spoke on a panel today at the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (San Fernando Valley).  Marathon also attended and sent the following:  

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra

Really appreciate it.  Will you be attending?

Jeff, yes Tues at 10:00 a.m. in Sacramento. Gwen in my office will firm up
the schedule. Mark, IGS.

Great.  Just to make sure.  I've got an address of 3310 El Camino, Suite 120. This correct?  Is there a number there in case something comes up?

Best,
Jeff

YES, SEE YOU TOMORROW. MARK

3310 El Camino (Sacramento).  Suite 120.

Just sent you yahoo map/directions on how to get to DWR.

Hi Cynthia:

I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday, Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM (want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.

Best,
Jeff

Thanks.

Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

Hey, I've got a "devil" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from becoming "hellish."

Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?

I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc.

Greetings:
 
The Commission denied it.  Work is underway to appeal the Commission's decision to the courts.  Sue Mara is taking the lead on this for us.  She can update you on where the appeal stands.  Be great to get you support for/participation in the appeal.

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
"This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." 
"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

You folks giving this to the press?  Might be useful.

You have time to talk a bit more about what we were discussing on the call?  In particular, impact on the book of negotations around the PX credit calc going foward?

There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Steve:

Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.

Best,
Jeff

agreed.

You take care.  If for whatever reason, there's anything I can do, please j=

Dear Friends,

Today, a very delicate and beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to me=
 from Enron Government Affairs.  It is a bouquet of blooming orchids, purpl=

Jude was an emissions broker for Cantor Fitzgerald and worked on the 104th =
floor of the North Tower at the World Trade Center.  Jude and I met last Ap=

me wonderful times together in Houston and New York City, we talked often. =
 Last Friday morning, Jude called me to say hello - one last time. =20

My friend was a kind and considerate man with a gentle heart.  The irony of=
 his life is that he and his family fled Lebanon in the eighties to escape =
the war there. =20

Jude's world is now a world of eternal love and peace.  And his spirit will=
 be kept alive by the memories that his family and friends share with each =
other, and with those of you who didn't have the joy of knowing him persona=

Your flowers, your comforting words, and your friendship have eased my sadn=

Yep.  It's moving along.  The budget, and the R's desire to mess with Davis, are prolonging things a bit.  But all indications are that Loretta will hold DA until the 12th.  How'd the afternoon go?

Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
other suppliers on this issue.

Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Phil

Please keep this confidential and internal to the company.  Thanks.

Hi all-

Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal.

Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). 

In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. 

That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.

Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.

Best,
Jeff

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in Sept-Oct. The memo states that the CPUC, Governor, Treasurer, etc. have agreed with the new timetable.

I just received this document from Angelides' office - it's a memo outlining
a revised timetable for the PUC actions required for the bond sale. FYI. EM.

FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  

Happy 4th to all.

It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get an amendment here.

Best,
Jeff

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply "to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."  I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can give you some specific language.)

Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.  Thanks.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

Here's the proposal:

There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)
If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

Thoughts?

Jeff

thanks, paul.  apologies, i dont' even remember seeing this.  leslie, can we discuss on thursday.  i  can update you on everything underway w.r.t. cal gas.  thursday work for you?

Knowing your swamped and all ... did you respond to this e-mail or contact Phillip Allen?

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.

Yes.

Let's try and set up a call to talk about the California intrastate gas issues noted below (LDC hedging, rate unbundling and system upgrades/expansions).  Does Tues. July 10 at 3:00 Central work for everyone?

(Roger please pass on to EES folks who should be on).

Thanks.

Leslie --

Can you organize a call that goes through these issues and begins to rationalize the information requested by Phillip?  While these issues are important, I don't see the CPUC doing anything in the near-term to help fix the problems.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.

Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

Jim

Scott Stoness@EES

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001."  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

Scott

thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking tiles on the board.  just let us know.

The attached is the final product of the discussions which have been
occurring between the various consumer groups attempting to keep Edsion
solvent while retaining some potential for direct access.  IEP has
participated in some of these discussions.
IEP is being asked to sign this letter. It is time sensitive because of

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:

Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. 

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Here is the very short amendment for the Sher Bond Bill.  Mike Day

 - X25946.DOC 

Just talked to Fielder. U have 5 minutes to debrief?  Sending this to Kean/Shapiro/Steffes.  Jeff

i'd send to the big list.  i used to send what julie malinowski sent around.

Thanks for you comments.  I did this prior to the meeting w/Keeley yesterday.  I assume that, if this thing gets off the ground, we'll have the opportunity to get this thoughts into whatever it is that the legislature produces.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Jeff

Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby

Fighting the kangaroo court actually got us some points with the media.  If we can continue without getting anyone (other than Dasovich) thrown in jail, let's fight.

Mark
The Dunn Committee will be taking up the contempt citations again on Tuesday, July 10.  We are currently contemplating two actions.   First, we intend to offer to produce some documents, most notably the ISO bid data sought (which the Committee already has anyway).  Secondly, as we do not expect this voluntary partial production to placate the Committee, we are preparing an action to file in federal court in Sacramento on Monday challenging the subpoena to the extent it seeks to require the production of documents other than those we offered to produce.  Robin Gibbs and Mike Kirby are on board with this.  Please let me know if would like any additional information about these matters.  Thank you.    

FYI.  From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. 
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. 
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. 

May you be forced to spend eternity with David Lazarus....

P.S. I'm taking next week off.  I'll be in the Middle East for martyr training.

It's just that I can't begin to imagine a better or more noble spokesman, especially portrayed in the light of a martyr, than you.  Will you wear the shirt?  I think the camera loves it.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

I apologize.  I thought I'd put you on my "big" distribution list.  When and if I do any updates to smaller groups.  I'll put you on those, too.  Look forward to meeting and discussing next time I'm in Houston.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
	Hope everything in California is going well and hope you had a good 4th of July.  Earlier today, I was meeting with some people from EES/ENA and they mentioned that you send out regular updates on California.  I would be very interested in being added to the distribution list.  This would help us see if there are any discrepancies in what we independent report and give us insight on which issues need to be explored further.  If you are ever in Houston, I would love to meet with you and discuss some of our common interests as it relates to commercial operations.  Please let me know if you have any questions or are unable to add me to the distribution list.  

Thanks,
Kristin Walsh

WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's a=
pproach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle w=

the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d=

   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you g=
o with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people act=
ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De=
mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.=
 Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus=
h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R=
epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and =
gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w=
ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou=
ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an=
 opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa=
id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy=
 came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c=
ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum =
wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth=
er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic=
y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican =
issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President =
Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th=
e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ=
y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden =
to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce=
nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp=
oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for =
the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N=
ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm=
ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I=
t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in =
May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex=
t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme=
nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin=
g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne=
ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped =
defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac=

ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of =
Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte=
rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a=
lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants=
 that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati=
on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor=
t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo=
my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi=
s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle =
extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ=
icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co=
llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc=
Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights=
 and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio=
n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb=
ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe=
llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a=
dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc=
ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=
ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=
s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=
ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=
o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=
ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the=
 president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=
ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials=
 say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=
y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=
kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=
or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=

he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=
g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =
last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call=
 for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =
and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=
ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit=
ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=

You can send both, but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest.  Definitely want to make sure that none of our stuff ends up in the hands of the media.

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

Best,
Jeff

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Gee, now that's a "rib"-tickler.

"rib"ald - get it??

No, I don't think so.  Haley and Wil's vocabularies may expanded a bit,
though.  Thanks again for  having them.  Very kind of you.

Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at some point very soon.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

FYI   Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the
Sher Bond bill  which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for
DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that
was purchased by DWR.  Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it.

I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code
Section 80110 be repealed in the bill.  That would leave direct access in
place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable
exit fee provisions.  Without a change like this, the bill would simply
reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the
Commission.  There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the
PUC to not suspend direct access.

Think it would be extremely helpful to have Jeff and/or Jim Steffes update us on Monday. I will set-up if you don't already have something going.
 		

Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.

Hi all-
Here are the final document and letter. I will also be faxing everyone a
copy of the letter with signatures.

Thanks,
Delaney

 - FINAL DRAFT issues outline.doc 
 - FINAL COVER LETTER.doc 

Sorry, but no.

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.

07/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) 
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. 
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. 
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. 
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. 
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. 
"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

See you on Sunday with language on Direct Access.

Best,
Jeff

Folks-
Ok, here is the plan. We need to draft language on the following issues
(including all the options under each of the issues) that were included in
our Roadmap Document:

Direct Access
Large Customer Utility Service options
Rate Relief
Customer Specific Generation
Renewable Energy

These are the pieces that are NOT covered in other plans, documents, etc. We
need to have the language completed no later than Monday 7/9 at 5:00pm.

I am open to suggestions on how best to handle the work -- maybe assigning
the topics above to folks and then getting together to refine and finalize a
work product? If everyone thinks this is a plan that can work and if there
is a specific topic you would like to tackle please let me know. I would
propose meeting on Sunday at say 3:00 at Mike Kahl's office if that meets
with everyone's approval.

Thanks,
Delaney

FYI.  The call took place today at 4:00 pm EDT, but is available for replay for 48 hours.

Campaign funds will pay for spots 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Saturday, July 7, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. 
Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. 
"The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. 
Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." 
Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. 
South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. 
"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." 
Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. 
"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." 
Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. 
"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. 
Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." 
Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." 
Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. 
Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. 
Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. 
But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. 
Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. 
Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. 
The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. 
Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. 
"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said.

Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in strike-out-underline.

Best,

All-
I have merged everyone's seperate language into one document - this may be
easier to work from today, especially for those of you on the phone.

Talk to you all at 3:00.

Thanks,

 - MERGED LEG LANGUAGE.doc 

Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?

Below is an update from the weekend's activities.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.

Best,
Jeff

Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.

i'll be participating.  thanks.

Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).

This looks like LA Times/Wall Street Journal material......

Here is the transcript of the ISO's real-time desk asking Enron real-time trader Ryan Slinger to help the ISO "set" the market-clearing price ("MCP") for replacement energy.  The ISO wanted Enron to help set the MCP for replacement energy at $91.86, because the ISO was upset that the MCP had dropped to a penny, and now market participants were buying the ISO's excess energy a penny (after having sold it to the ISO for $91 the day before).

There are two phone calls.  The first call is the ISO calling to ask us to help it to set the price.  The next call occurs three minutes later and is the ISO calling because we didn't put in the bid.  Our trader told the ISO that he had to "talk to his boss" because he "didn't want to do anything wrong."  

Note:  I have just learned a complicating detail:  Coincidentally, our desk did put in a bid for $91.86 for Hour 18, which was what the ISO had requested.  However, the bid had been formulated before the ISO called our desk.

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:40:50 - 14.43:38

Enron:  Enron, this is David [Porter].

ISO:  Hi David.  This is Allen at the ISO.

Enron:  David: Hi Allen.  How ya doing?

ISO:  Allen:  Hold on one sec.  I've got to get something.

Unknown:  Stage one at 11.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, I'm on the hour-ahead desk.  Did you guys put a bid in?

Enron:  David:  Yes, hang on one second Allen.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah.

Enron:  Ryan:  This is Ryan [Slinger].

ISO:  Allen:  Hey Ryan, this is Allen at the ISO hour ahead.  Did you guys put a trade in, replacement [energy]?  Not trade, but a bid?

Enron:  Ryan:  For which hour, for hour 15?

ISO:  Allen:  For hour 16?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16, correct.

ISO:  Allen:  Can you guys continue to put the price at that?

Enron:  Ryan:  At what?  At $91.86?

ISO:  Allen:  Yes

Enron:  Ryan:  Um,?.

ISO:  Allen:  This isn't on a recorded line, but we wanted to do that because of some of the things that we are seeing.  It would be good to keep it [the Market Clearing Price for Replacement Energy] at a higher price.  It doesn't matter how many megawatts you  put it at, but we want to clear it at a higher price.

Enron:  Ryan:  Wait, you said we're not on a recorded line, or we are?

ISO:  Allen:  We're not.  No, we're not, okay.  We already talked to the day-ahead research guy and myself, but we saw you guys clear at $91 and we wanted you, if it's possible, to continue to set that, whether it's 20 MW or whatever you want to put in there.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, um?..

ISO:  Allen:  We want to clear it at that because of some issues we are seeing as far as others that are taking advantage of the market.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh yeah.  Because it had been clearing like at $100, hadn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  Not replacement.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, not replacement?

ISO:  Allen:  No.  What happened is that we bought it back?.see, the day-ahead was purchased at like $100 and then what happened is that the hour-ahead . . .a bunch of these  people were buying it back for a penny over the [inter] ties.  They were faking it.  So we wanted to keep the price up high.   

Allen and Ryan:  Unintelligible.

Enron:  Ryan:  So they were selling it, oh, in the day ahead, and buying it back?.

ISO:  Allen:  Buying like 60 bucks. . . trying to make money off of it, then basically they are trying to buy it back at a penny.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

ISO:  Allen:  That's really ticking us off and right now . . .

Enron:  Ryan:  That to me signals, that's probably Powerex, isn't it?

ISO:  Allen:  There's about four of them right now.

Enron:  Ryan:  Shit.

ISO:  Allen:  And for the day-ahead for tomorrow, we didn't, we didn't, we took them out.  Basically, we're not allowing  anything over the ties.

Enron:  Ryan:  I didn't submit one for 17 or ?.

ISO:  Allen:  That's fine.  They'll probably go to a penny and they'll probably get excited and do a bunch, and we'll hopefully cut them off if you can get the next price and the next market at 80 or 91.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.  All right.  Well, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  I appreciate it.  It's actually in the best interest for the State and the ISO [with] what these guys are doing, so we are trying to put a stop to it.

Enron:  Ryan: Okay.

ISO:  Allen.  Thanks, bye.

Transcription of a telephone conversation between the ISO's Real Time Desk and Enron's Real Time Desk - July 3, 2001, 14:46:55 - 14:47:40 (3 minutes later)

Enron:  This is Ryan.

ISO:  Hey Ryan, its Allen.

Enron:  Ryan:  Yeah.

ISO:  Allen:  Hey, did you put it in for the next hour?

Enron:  Ryan:  For hour 16?

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah, no, they already ran 17.

Enron:  Ryan:  Oh, I didn't do 17, no.

ISO:  Allen:  Well, see, we're gonna run, we're gonna run 18 coming up here in the next fifteen minutes.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay.

ISO:  Allen:  If you have any questions, let me know.  I hope you know this is me from the ISO.  I don't know if you think I'm somebody else but you can call me at the hour-ahead desk.

Enron:  Ryan:  Well, I mean, I'm talking to my boss right now as far as, because of, you know, I don't want to be doing anything that's wrong.

ISO:  Allen:  Yeah? 

Enron:  Ryan:  Even if it is helping you guys out, if it's wrong, I can't do it.

ISO:  Allen:  I know, but if you continue to bid in at, um, the market, that's the best thing to do.  For replacement.  All right.

Enron:  Ryan:  Okay, I'll see what I can do.

ISO:  Allen:  Thanks, man.
 

Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.

Sounds good.  How about first thing tomorrow morning for a call?

I have been instructed by Chris C that we need to go to DWR, PG&E the state or whom ever will listen.  I will start working on the all-in (PG&E/SCE) presentation!

When are you both available for a conference call.

Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed edits our discussion.

Jeff

Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

may have been updated a bit prior to the presentation, but yep, that's it.  will do for now.  please forward to rick.  when i'm back in the office i'll do more searching.  thanks a bunch.  i'm assuming this is what he's referring to.

Best,
Jeff

Folks:
Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Best,
Jeff

 

(Corrects lead to say judge recommended FERC hearings to

result disagreements; adds comments from judge in fifth paragraph

and comments from Enron in 13th paragraph.)

 

     Washington, July 9 (Bloomberg) -- A judge who oversaw two

weeks of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at persuading power

sellers to pay refunds in California and other western states

recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hold

hearings to resolve disagreements within 60 days.

     Two weeks of FERC-ordered talks ended today with the two

sides no closer to an accord.

     ``In 15 days, you can't work miracles,'' said Curtis Wagner,
FERC's chief administrative law judge. ``The numbers were too far

apart.''

      California says it is due a refund of $8.9 billion because

the companies charged excessive prices. Other western states are

also requesting money.

     A group of power sellers offered $510 million to California

during the negotiations, scoffing at the state's method of

calculating the refund, Wagner said. Other parties to the talks

offered about $206 million, bringing the total offer from

generators to $716 million.

      On Saturday, the state brought in analysts who explained how

the state calculated its estimate. He wasn't convinced by

California's arguments that it should receive $8.9 billion, said

Wagner, who wouldn't provide his own estimate of how much should

be paid.

     Wagner said FERC should hold hearings of 60 days or less and

should calculate a refund based on a system it approved for price

caps on June 18. The caps are based on the costs of the highest

priced generator during the early stages of a power shortage.

      That formula should be applied retroactively to Oct. 1,

Wagner said. He wouldn't provide an estimate of the size of such a

refund, saying it would require research into fuel prices from

that time period.

     Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the judge's

recommendation was a victory for his state. Wagner's formula would

give his state a refund of ``several billion dollars,'' and

California will sue to get the rest, he said.

     ``The judge said we're entitled to our money without

releasing any of our claims,'' Kahn told reporters.

     Generators were mixed on what Wagner's recommendations meant,

though they agreed the state asked for too much.

    ``Under the faulty methodology the state has come up with (to

justify the $8.9 billion refund), we would be owed money because

we bought more than we sold in the spot market in the period in

question,'' said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron Corp, one of

the power sellers taking part in the negotiations. ``That's shows

how ridiculous this is.''

    Houston-based Enron didn't participate in the offer to refund

$510 million, Palmer said, without being more specific.

     ``Nothing I've seen suggests that California cares about a

settlement,'' Palmer said. ``What they care about is shifting

blame. What they care about is a witch hunt.''

     Duke Energy Corp. is ``very pleased'' by the judge's

recommendations, said Brent Bailey, vice president and general

counsel of the Charlotte-based company. The judge's plan fixes

problems with California's methodology for calculating the

refunds, he said.

      California's two biggest utilities have piled up almost $14

billion in debt because of the surging prices that resulted when

the state's plan to deregulate its electricity system failed. The

state began buying power on the utilities' behalf in January and

has spent close to $8 billion.

"Sacramento or Salem?"  Sort of has a nice ring to it.

No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

Best,
Jeff

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

You're a saint.

Thanks Barbara:
Dorothy just phoned me and I believe we're all squared away.  Can you call her and make sure that you're comfortable?

Best,
Jeff

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara

Hi:  Thanks for the wires story.  I talked to Dorothy and we're square.  If anyone tries to make any other changes, please let me know first or have them call me directly, whichever you prefer.  Thanks for all your help.

Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?

The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.

The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)

Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.

Kisses,
Jeff

PS Colleen doing OK?  I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are....

Nope.  She was in NY last week, though.  Scary.

I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday now also!!  On Tuesdays I have a
religion class through UC Extension (its all on how the different religions
view "why we are here").  Pretty relevant for today, huh?

On Wednesdays I am taking a cooking class at home chef in Laurel Village.
Should be fun.

Bet my classes are better than your classes.

The pilot at Enron is going EXTREMELY well.  I will get you the name of our
champion.  He wants to introduce this all over Enron.  Energy Services just
loves it.  Ian has been living out there in Houston for almost two weeks
now.

How are the meetings coming along with Deal Bench and Net Works?

We are still in Santa Cruz - we'll be back tomorrow, hopefully we'll see you
Wed night after class??

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Heeeeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaaaaaaaawww!!!!!   Gouge dat taht moh!

I just looked down onto the mouse pad I've been using for the past four years (literally) and I notice that it advertises the "Transwestern Pipeline Company - An ENRON Company".
Insidious; it has influenced my every click over these past years...Oh, how the Taht Moh turns! 

It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.

You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Assemblyman Bill Leonard's most recent e-newsletter contained the
following information.  I think it is very interesting to consider in
light of the present energy situation in California and the comments of
our present Governor.

Regards,
Curt

***Who Really Powers California?***
Governor Davis has made no secret that he believes that swashbuckling,
cattle rustling, energy barons from Texas are to blame for our energy
crisis.  While Texas power companies make for good bad guys in the
Governor's transparent Kabuki theater of blame, Leonard Letter readers
may
be interested to see who really provides power to Californians.  The
following list illustrates what percentage of our power supply each
group of
generators provides. (Editor's note: these percentages have been rounded
up
resulting in slightly more than 100%)

18%- Pacific Gas and Electric (California)
15%- Southern California Edison (California)
11%- Imported power from the Northwest (including Canada)
10%- Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (California)
10%- Imported power from the Southwest
7%- State and Federal Agencies
6%- AES power company
5%- Municipal Utilities and Irrigation Districts
5%- Reliant power company
4%- Duke power company
4%- Southern power company
4%- Dynegy power company
1%- Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California)
1%- Calpine power company
1%- San Diego Gas and Electric (California)
 
It should be noted that of this list, only Dynegy and Reliant are from
Texas.  These two companies represent a total of 9% of California's
energy
portfolio.  By comparison, Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's
AES,
and North Carolina's Duke Energy, have a 14% share of our energy
portfolio.

This list does not focus on who is gaming the market.  However, every
provider listed benefited from skyrocketing energy prices.  In trying to

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. 
"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."

Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.

FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:

"Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "

Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.

Best,
Jeff

Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:

Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

Thanks again for all the effort.

Best,
Jeff

any sense of why all the pulling?

(Published July 10, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- Negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of Cali=
fornia's electricity debacle sputtered to an end Monday with the sides ligh=
t-years apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales.=20
The impasse raises the specter of years of litigation, with a regulatory ju=
dge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about $1 billion while =
California is seeking at least $8.9 billion and perhaps much more.=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Curtis Wagner sai=
d that within a week he'll urge the five FERC commissioners to begin fact-f=
inding hearings on how much is truly owed, following guidelines he outlined=
 sketchily Monday.=20
Among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed -- something=
 that could reduce state claims by about one-third -- and changing the way =
power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators.=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California=
 is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments fo=
r no refunds.=20
With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power t=
raders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. B=
ut Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state st=
ill owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.=20
The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San=
 Jose-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.=
=20
"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement," Calpine spokes=
man Bill Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any=
 details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.=20
Enron Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said Califo=
rnia officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the=
 state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharge=
s.=20
"These talks never had a chance," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. "Their =
political skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of Cali=
fornia could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a =
witch hunt."=20
Of the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by =
what Wagner called the "Big Five" generators -- Reliant, Duke, Mirant, Will=
iams and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125=
 million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, wh=
ich is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six Ca=
lifornia municipal utilities.=20
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest munic=
ipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amoun=
t it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Th=
ursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.=20
Consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief publi=
c remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on=
 the state's troubled electric scene.=20
"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outra=
geous," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If they're g=
oing to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah."=20
Hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was =
no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been a=
nd then work toward a compromise from there.=20
The state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Ind=
ependent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high ev=
en while the state called it conservatively low.=20
Joel Newton, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that =
the ISO has consistently based its demand on "sketchy and incomplete" data.=
=20
The face-off between Davis and power merchants began last fall, as wholesal=
e electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they =
could be driven into bankruptcy.=20
The governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's powe=
r shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they =
followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situati=
on.=20
FERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electr=
icity rates are "just and reasonable," has made repeated, unsuccessful effo=
rts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.=20
State Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said Monday that t=
he failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure "comes as no=
 surprise."=20
Negotiators representing generators "refused to even acknowledge the inesca=
pable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional=
 market -- at California's expense," he said.=20
Davis, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith=
 with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have bee=
n slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesa=
le electricity, they "now have the opportunity to redeem themselves."=20
He suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is rec=
ommended by the judge.=20
Wagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed=
 resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility=
 and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futilit=
y.=20
Michael Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the Calif=
ornia ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.=
=20
"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't r=
eceive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as=
 helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated" =
because refunds were offered.=20
Meanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison soun=
ded the call for more talks.=20
"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement," said Steve P=
ickett, general counsel of Southern California Edison. PG&E said in a prepa=
red statement that the sessions "provide a solid basis for further negotiat=
ions."=20
How much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question =
mark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual r=
efunds will amount to "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion." B=
ut he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC comm=
issioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.=20
Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mi=
xed bag for the state.=20
The judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000=
, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state=
's refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.=20
But Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the cou=
rts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.=
=20
"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder," Kahn said.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy of North Am=
erica, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund =
order in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks," Bailey=
 said.=20

Third power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out ele=
ctricity yet.=20
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
The flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov. Gray Davis was only a t=
rickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday, accord=
ing to sources close to California's energy crisis.=20
Heralded by Davis as part of a "powerful one-two-three punch" that will bri=
ng California closer to energy independence, the Los Medanos Energy Center =
in Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day, they sa=
id.=20
That is less than 5 percent of the plant's 555-megawatt operating capacity.=
=20
Los Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week bu=
t is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks, accordin=
g to knowledgable sources.=20
Representatives for Calpine and the governor's office, when pressed for det=
ails, acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said the=
y did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday.=20
Calpine, which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los=
 Medanos, is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn't immediat=
ely available for the media, spokeswoman Katherine Potter said.=20
"Even if it was two megawatts, that's two more megawatts that we didn't hav=
e yesterday," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
He said the opening was "largely ceremonial," timed for the convenience of =
the governor and Calpine's top executive.=20
But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the media event "a deception=
." It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has a=
ttended in the past two weeks.=20
"It's the governor trying to convince people he's hard at work solving the =
problem when it's all for show," Rosenfield said. "He's governing by sound =
bite. He's certainly getting his money's worth from the consultants he hire=
d."=20
Davis political adviser Garry South said last week that the governor's new =
radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in Calif=
ornia.=20
"Generation comes up in our polls as being the No. 1 thing people want us t=
o do -- build more power plants," South said then. "People want the sense t=
hat progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control."=
=20
The other two plants that Davis kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Su=
tter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity.=20
Calpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos withi=

"In the first month of these new plants, there are always stops and starts,=
" said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander. "Sometimes we shut down altogethe=

State reveals high-priced power deals=20
By Dale Kasler and Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writers
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
The state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity o=
n the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wild=
ly within minutes.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping it=
s power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and=
 trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purcha=
ses since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The informatio=
n was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai=
ls of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gra=
y Davis, her political nemesis.=20
The state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal=
ifornia's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising ques=
tions from lawmakers and others about Davis' policies for resolving the sta=
te's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of=
 gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.=20
When it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a=
 business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days =
in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot=
 cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largel=
y because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their depe=
ndence on spot sales.=20
"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," sai=
d Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.=20
The information released Monday covered the first three months of the year =
and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for elec=
tricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas gene=
rator that owns several plants in the state. Duke Energy Corp. of North Car=
olina charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but t=
hat sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state'=
s transmission grid.=20
The documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy =
power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.=20
Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o=
f San Diego Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energ=
y Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a=
bout $23.7 million.=20
Among others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 m=
illion through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; At=
lanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville =
Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility Dis=
trict $80.7 million.=20
Generally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the price=
s. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator Williams Cos. commanded $565 a me=
gawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californian=
s.=20
Location also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit=
 $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The differ=
ence was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern Califor=
nia, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't s=
o scarce.=20
Split-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid =
$400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day. By 10 a.m. it was pa=
ying Mieco Inc., a Long Beach trading firm, $475 for the same product.=20
"That's the spot market -- it's the most volatile market in the world, and =
it changes on a second-by-second basis," said Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Pa=
lmer.=20
For all the criticism leveled at Duke, Reliant and other big corporations, =
government-owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high p=
rices.=20
BC Hydro, the electric utility owned by the Canadian province of British Co=
lumbia, submitted bills for up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The city of Glend=
ale charged $375 a megawatt-hour for power in January, while SMUD charged $=
309 a megawatt-hour in March. The city of Eugene, Ore., averaged $450 a meg=
awatt-hour in February.=20
"We play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace," said BC Hydro =
spokesman Wayne Cousins. "Our traders worked very hard to find additional s=
ources of electricity to keep the lights on in California. Had we not come =
through and stepped forward with these supplies, the consequences to Califo=
rnia customers would have been severe."=20
The state also said it has spent $14.4 million on administrative costs in b=
uying power.=20

Government finds ways to conserve: The Santa Rita Jail goes solar as agenci=
es get creative to cut costs.
By Cheryl Miller
Bee Correspondent
(Published July 10, 2001)=20
To Matt Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita =
Jail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.=20
When all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt=
 photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the=
 United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to =
20 percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.=20
That sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at th=
e jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. M=
uniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.=20
"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a bu=
siness decision, just investing your money," said Muniz. "There's virtually=
 no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts r=
ight into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it. I think=
 (solar) is the wave of the future, even though it's been around 30 or 40 y=
ears."=20
The Santa Rita Jail project is among the largest, and perhaps most conspicu=
ous, examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity us=
e in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov. Gray Davis' call for pub=
lic entities to conserve.=20
Among the examples:=20
San Francisco leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered=
 rooftop projects around the city.=20
The Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier -- =
at 6 a.m.-- and close at 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday this summer so o=
ffices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours.=20
Sacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can bet=
ter withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees. Workers=
 have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps oper=
ate during low demand.=20
"When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns fr=
om some citizens, that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help ou=
t," said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Associat=
ion of Counties. "Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they we=
re asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as hu=
manly possible."=20
Kings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signe=

the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity=
.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j=

 said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.  With negotiations at=
 an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory=
 Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in ref=

at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an=

erall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wag=
ner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 bill=
ion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may=
 ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges f=
rom the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those all=
egations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner serv=

k all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said =
Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye=

 even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "t=
hat's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  Calif=
ornia officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities C=

 COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between=
 California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap=
sed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg=
ulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 bill=
ion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of =
dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administr=
ative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previ=
ewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who =
mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f=
or electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which th=
ey may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co=
uld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po=
wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util=
ities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing=
" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising=
 from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai=
d FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula incl=
udes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for ca=
lculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintai=
n that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that =
would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice pre=
sident of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner=
's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's =
dysfunctional power market.  But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator,=
 said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of pe=
ople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there =
should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kah=
n, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power gri=
d.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be =
in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, =
we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r=
emainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its=
 $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r=
emains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their con=
duct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position. =
 During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhe=
re near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers h=
ad put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from=
 splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."=
  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee=
n the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr=
eviously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of barga=
ining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  John H.=
 Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the=
 state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund dema=
nd. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 mil=
lion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot b=
ack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach=
ed the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any =
of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been c=
ooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The stat=
e's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The =
$8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera=
tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when=
 wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli=
cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b=
een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo=
r the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to =
tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner =
said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo=
r calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he s=
aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an=
d should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula=
ted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas=
 heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr=
ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath=
er than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho=
se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre=
ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over=
charges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe=
r would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  Brent=

 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spendin=

the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov=

prices are not limited to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for=
 the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that price=

 said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow=

ases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an ave=
rage of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of t=

 suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday=
 that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key t=
o his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the pr=
ice bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee m=
embers and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data can=
not be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula=
 Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to=
 drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records=
 show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyratio=
ns to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal=
 thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi=
al legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o=
thers in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority =
to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  "The only o=
ne who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provi=
ded in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees T=
ell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob=
tain the information elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."  Th=
ree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month =
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergen=
cy.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=
 California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricit=
y grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp=
lanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro=
vide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Du=
nn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said =
Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Du=
ke was guilty of the same tactics.  "Duke is trying to draw the impression =
that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we c=
annot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. Tha=
t hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula V=
ista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must p=
ublicly examine "the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t=
o the plant." They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, =
he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla=
nts in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and =
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom William=
s insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's =
demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd=
ing documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o=
ver.  "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that=
 we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I=
 don't know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threate=
ned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd=
ing documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would compl=
y to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn sa=
id the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to=
 comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charge=
d with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the fina=
l arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe=
nalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing seve=
re fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sen=

Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rat=
e hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to r=
escue Edison. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve=
n as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares =
for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power=
 plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting =
task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la=
sting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for =
consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by =
the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-=
control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr=
owing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat=
ing one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r=
escue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate =
in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie=
s a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f=
or other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac=
ts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead =
to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer=
 advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact=
s be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these=
 critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts=
 and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d=
eals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st=
ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f=
or more than 25 million residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Co=
mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s=
truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B=
owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals the=
y could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati=
ons took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contr=
acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor=
e immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto=
n. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework=
ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar=
ged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine=
, the contracts were the best we could do,' " Bowen said.  For his part, Da=
vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the=
 form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th=
e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad=
ministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon=
g-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,=
 or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . =
. dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo=
rnians," Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30=
% from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego=
tiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi=
ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor=
nia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some=
one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. "After the fire is out,=
" he said, "you complain about the water damage."  The contracts have other=
 defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, =
who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene=
rators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t=
o wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not t=
o get a great price; it's to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts=
 have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S=
an Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz=
ations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c=
ontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep=
resenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume=
r group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill=
ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c=
osts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip=
ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an =
additional 10% to 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Repub=
lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who ca=
n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' r=
emorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as =
a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa=
ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing =
into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc=
y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b=
y Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu=
led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi=
th legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which=
 has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste=
m of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge =
ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a=
nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th=
e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la=
rgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the =
new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an=
d repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni=
cipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t=
he Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n=
eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr=
acts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he=
 concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses =
political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers =
Union, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech=
nology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s=
eparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy=
 our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be=
tter off in the long run," Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade=
rs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with=
 the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  "They are proble=
matic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit=
y prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t=
o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by=
 the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State=
 Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.=
4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i=
nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out o=
f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale," he said. "We will mov=
e toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic=
h was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate=
d utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b=
illion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p=
ay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t=
he Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated=
 to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm=
all customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr=
oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department=
 of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this=
 year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D=
-San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir=
e the commission to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water =
Resources decides to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat=
ic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu=
rers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a=
gency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process=
, at least there is a process," Stewart said, referring to the commission's=
 procedures to set electricity rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR jus=
t tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Oth=
ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi=
nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department=
 of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in=
to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. =
 In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create=
d "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdict=
ion of the PUC.  "There is no public power agency in California that is rev=
iewed by the PUC," said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department =
of Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel=

cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN117914.DTL   Washington -- An adm=
inistrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to Gov. Gray Davis and=
 California energy officials, cast aside the state's claim that it is owed =
$8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for furthe=
r hearings to determine "hard numbers."  The judge, ending talks designed t=
o settle the dispute between California and power sellers, said the state a=
nd its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills tha=
n they are owed for overcharges by the generators.  The comments by Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagn=
er, although a strong endorsement of the generators' position, seemed to in=
dicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the f=
ive-member regulatory commission.  "There are refunds due (to California) t=
hat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wag=
ner said yesterday.  "At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from =
the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities=
 in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t=
hat (the state) may come up with."  Now, it will be up to the federal regul=
ators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t=
he talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th=
e state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=
  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t=
o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing=
s would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 =
days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing=
 session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato=
ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca=
lifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a=
 sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D=
avis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for=
 California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the=
 close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s=
tate is owed refunds.  "I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo=
logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no =
refunds are due," Davis said.  The governor's chief representative at the t=
alks, Michael Kahn, called the judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of=
 the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th=
e state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR=
S FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo=
r example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9=
 billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t=
he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200=
0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t=
he October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at =
least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,=
 vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that=
 under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.=
5 billion.  "Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California =
has been saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.  Bu=
t Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a =
serious offer.  "Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer=
s out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f=
aith," Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the=
 generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The =
judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi=
ve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli=
on by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California =
municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel=
lers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in=
cluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of=
 the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain=
ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies =
and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t=
o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR=
ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to=
 remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego=
 Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g=
overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun=
ds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el=
se.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad=
e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom=
ise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa=
tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  "The Califo=
rnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr=
omise," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc=
iation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar figure=
 and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you h=
ave to be willing to compromise."  Up next 1. The Federal Energy Regulatory=

if anything, California was overcharged. 2. If ordered by the commission, a=

rkers were still scraping wet concrete on support columns as Gov. Gray Davi=
s celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the=
 latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California "build its=
 way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts=
 on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b=
lackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  "This is the =
third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said, pumping his =
fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. "In t=
he past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throu=
ghout the 1990s."  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte=
r Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of=
 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel=
d plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  Davis used yester=
day's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged =
the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o=
f energy favorite son.  "They were the first to enter long-term contracts w=
ith us," the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre=
ssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc=
harges, but unlike the others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in nego=
tiations.  "They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us=
," he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic=
ient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru=
n than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market =
rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine Pre=
sident Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making e=
xcess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr=
icity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target dat=
e, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a =
megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 3=
00 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity t=
o the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In t=
he long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt=
 hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso=
urces, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled =
under high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hou=
r the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts. =
 Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- m=
egawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doi=
ng its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  "Ours are the lowest contr=
acts in the state," he said. "If these plants weren't online, we'd be havin=
g blackouts."  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g=
rid said California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt c=
ounts."  "It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so=
 over the summer," said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent S=

acramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of =
criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power cris=
is, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of =
the money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le=
ss than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, wh=
ile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi=
a got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be=
 more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials=
 are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of=
 Texas.  Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not=
 acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure =
and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- =
most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.  Yesterday, =
a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas=
 firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav=
e also gouged California.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably h=
ave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," sai=
d Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.  The latest financial information is co=
ntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7=
.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $=
5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made =
a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. =
 Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most =
expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and =
buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropp=
ed as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of even=
ts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re=
cover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa=
nies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2=
 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to tu=

igation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt procee=
dings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis.=

Curtis Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner=
 said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than=

16 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officia=
ls sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not =
made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the stat=
e would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split =
off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had=
 time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE=
RC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati=
ons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission =
ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr=
oducers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electr=

tead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 perce=

unsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces =
$1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of thes=

ies, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the pr=
oducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers =

/07/10/MNC115768.DTL   Despite a power-related mishap that released toxic f=

 cause dangerous releases in Contra Costa, a county study concludes.  The c=
ounty Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have ade=

a hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos=

 those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o=

lied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  "Unfortunately, the conclusio=
ns of the report can't be backed up by the facts," Larson said. "Oil and ch=
emical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow=
er failures over the years."  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oi=

   WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree o=
n refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiation=
s ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said=
 the state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.  The judge o=
verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re=
funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His=
 estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur=
ing negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w=
as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and=
 California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At=
 stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t=
o pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap=
sed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will =
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating =
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e=
nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t=
he California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o=
f the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for=
mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num=
bers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion=
s,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru=
ns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If=
 we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai=
nder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry =
representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone =
and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion=
,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy =
North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nob=
ody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagne=
r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying =
he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers=
.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon=
th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=
 prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und=
er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the =
power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat=
ion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par=
ticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on =
one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to=
 splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge=
nuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to =
make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the =
final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i=
n refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a=
sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed=
 information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun=
d total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any =
refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and=
 its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone =
of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp=
liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve=
 the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay=
ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good=
 faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past=
 the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th=
e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California=
 has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a=
 new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha=
t he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order=
 the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'=
t represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as =
high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures =
were calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W=
holesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.=
9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou=
ld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca=
lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp=
liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi=
ons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w=
ill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W=
agner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s=
uppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia=
ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $=
8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds =
beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the=
 state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi=
ssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect=
ricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f=

g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen=
cy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec=
onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w=

 the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss=

id $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The docu=

 around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the stat=

The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=

t prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for p=

spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assert=

 money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on w=
hether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term=
 power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend=
 that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t=

fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,=

the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th=

 for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v=
olatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour =
ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f=

uary, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per mega=

 Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575.  The state=
's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including =
the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-=

ns.  July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe=
r  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California i=
s owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the=
 $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.  And even at that, said Judge Cu=
rtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power =
bills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announ=
ced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw=
o weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's e=
lectricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissione=
rs' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 mill=
ion in refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billi=
on dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was=
."  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds=
 is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow=
er. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of wardi=
ng off future rate increases.  "California will get its $8.9 billion," insi=
sted Michael Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Indepe=
ndent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory =
in the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the=
 generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the t=
alks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ=
y offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refun=
d offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company wer=
e dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that =
California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug=
ing by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks=
 began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the=
 FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for ye=
ars.  "You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner sai=
d during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen=
dation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points du=
ring the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators=
 and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unpreceden=
ted Sunday session.  "The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.  While =
Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's commen=
ts, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better than a =
jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the state =
has to do all it can to get more than that.  And Davis backed up his team. =
 "Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we=
re overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably=
, the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi=
lity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering."  Power =
generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John Stout,=
 vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental position=
 has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  Brent Bailey, genera=
l counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's recommendation, "a fair one."=
  Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
 energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
 themselves from the state's refund request.  "I don't believe there really=
 exists a true justification for that number," said Assemblyman John Campbe=
ll, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that anything more than a wild number =
to throw out there."  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of =
overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu=
te the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma=
jority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for =
$8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be=
tween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued tw=
o refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in =
overcharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding,=
 saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is=
 also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  =
How energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard o=
f FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged wi=
th making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and tha=
t wholesale prices are "just and reasonable," rolls off the tongue.  The fi=
ve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home =
state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co=
ncluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's ele=
ctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term pow=
er contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FER=
C's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS A=
T STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amo=
unt power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's findi=
ng? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators:=
 More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. W=
agner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C=
alifornia. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A sta=
ble electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices =
are stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains u=
ncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW D=
ID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The =
state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the =
utilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the el=
ectricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the sta=
te began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicia=
ns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate=
s. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, c=
ompared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 bill=
ion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert=
s say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but =
the caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some =
power off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa=
gner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track =
formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after =
that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark=
et issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr=

 of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he=
 ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, t=
he state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eli=

 what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves!=
 Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in =
the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl=

 by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equ=

mpany  WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiat=
ions about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the st=
ate and power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the t=
alks began.  The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving=
 the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which=
 the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab=
out $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it =
would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e=
lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis =
that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be=
 resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav=
e cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac=
counting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly=
 overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2=
0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators=
 say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es=
timates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem=
ent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed=
eral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c=
omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would =
recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti=
ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w=
ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under =
federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and =
reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th=
at California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began=
 imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o=
f past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains =
uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than=
 for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil=
lion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho=
uld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon=
itoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact=
ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t=
hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is=
 closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar=
d by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom=
mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb=
e a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju=
dge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled=
ged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha=
tever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o=
f seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s=
aid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk=
s. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder =
in the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did =
not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue=
 generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato=
rs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,=
 speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California=
 .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se=
ttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m=
illion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w=
ould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their =
offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no=
w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t=
hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol=
lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press=
ed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We =
remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that =

. and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi=
ng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg=
er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  "The nu=
mbers were too far apart," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal=
 Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg=
otiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i=
mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f=
igure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec=
ted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  "A lot=
 of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't," Wagner told =
reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old Tennessea=
n. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."  He declin=
ed to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic=
ials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his=
 own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula=
 essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul=
d have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c=
osts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun=
d, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera=
ble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier=
 this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first =
three months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing=
 increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members =
appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow=
er prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes=
ale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner pa=
tterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthies=
t state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas =
prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to=
 an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from reco=
rd levels until last month.  Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication =
yesterday.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are goin=
g to be in the multiple billions," said Michael Kahn, chairman of the Calif=
ornia Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn no=
ted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t=
he principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state=
. The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claim=
s as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations=
.  "We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for =
the remainder," Kahn said. " California will get its $8.9 billion."  But th=
e state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni=
tor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state =
generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion=
 using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill=
ion goal.  Duke Energy is "very pleased'' by Wagner's action, said Brent Ba=
iley, vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company. Th=
e generators, however, repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t=
hem scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The m=
ajor generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 =
million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro=
m October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750=
 homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la=

Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company=
 executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of =

dn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrati=
ve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of =
potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion doll=
ars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it=
s insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would =
recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe=
r -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line=
 with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shav=
e $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to i=
ssue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the=
 FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring=
 refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals late=
r between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcha=
rging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers=
 indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "parti=
al" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the over=
charge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b=
e resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag=
 on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadl=
ine set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated=
 they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everythin=
g from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered=
 the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about =
the reach of the agency's authority.  "We haven't reached a settlement. We =
really haven't come close," said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli=
ant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor=
nia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than=
 a third of the Houston company's operating profit during the relevant peri=
od, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California soug=
ht from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill=
ion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the =
agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate=
r, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito=
ring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com=
panies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12=
4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=
ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=
C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =
act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda=
y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett=
lement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v=
alidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej=
ected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of=
 refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the s=
tate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera=
tors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and =
"unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away=
 with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo=

 any refunds will be way below this $9 billion."=09

State discloses spot power  buys

By Andrew  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  

SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

Thank you.

Hey Everybody!

Now that I have had a chance to test remote mail myself I think I can give you the basics and hopefully field your questions.

You can access your Outlook mail from any computer connected to the internet without logging on to any Enron dial-ups or sites.  
       To repeat: You can get to your Outlook mail without connecting to Enron.

On any internet connected computer type mail.enron.com in the address box.

At this point a logon box will appear.  It says, 'Please type your user name and password.'.  This is the exact user name and password 
       you use to logon to your Enron computer.

A Microsoft Outlook Web Access page should open up.  Mine opens directly to my Inbox, yours should too.  If not, one of the shortcuts in 
       the vertical 'tool bar', on the left side of the screen shout be an Inbox icon.  Click on it.      

To see your folders you will need to click on the word 'Folders' on the left side, vertical 'tool bar'.

Please try this at work so I can help answer your questions and concerns before you are out and about trying this new system.

Note: When accessing email through the internet you will not have a spell check option.  Your best bet is to copy/paste the email 
                 to a word or excel sheet and spell check it there.  Then make the necessary adjustments in your email before sending.

Please contact me with any questions you have, or if you need help logging on.

April

Thanks, Ken.  I'm focused on the letter, so it would be very helpful if you could draft some brief message points and email to me and Karen.  Then the three of us can bounce them around a  bit before distributing to the larger group for comment.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, if I can be of any help in developing the messages please let me know.  I'll be around all afternoon.

FYI.  Something's wacky with your server.  I got Rick's note, but ain't received your original.  And you are, indeed, awesome, MRS. Hunter.

Worse, there was no attachment in Rick's note.  Could you forward to me the final.  Thanks a gazillon.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

You're fired.

FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the Legislature as soon as possible.

In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's going to get very interesting from here.

Best,
Jeff

You all are awesome.  Many thanks.

Rick-
Attached please find our final draft of legislative language per your
request. We are ready and willing to draft other sections or language as
needed by you or the Speaker. Please feel free to contact me if you have any
questions about the draft. Please note there are disagreements over two
sections of language and they are so marked.

FYI - I will be sending this document out to the entire Working Group for
their information.

Thank you,
Delaney

Great first cut.  Thanks very much.  Keep 'em coming.

Left him a message earlier.  Haven't heard back yet.  I'll call him again first thing in the AM.  He's probably busy getting his number changed.

Folks.  I'm working on it, but it's going to require quite a bit of work.  Please chk your emails later this evening for the next draft.  I'll page folks--those with pagers, that is--to notify when I've emailed it.  Scott, please inform Hedy and Bev.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones

   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell

  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Greetings;

I've tried to accommodate everyone's comments, but there's still a hole or two.   In addition, seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more editing to make it shorter.  Richard, note that I've left a place holder in the opening paragraph to fill in a summary of our arguments and the conditions under which we'd be willing to produce certain documents.

Best,

1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.

2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff

Thanks very much.

The Dealbench contact is Jeff Bartlett.  His telephone number is (713) 853-5629.

JonAlan 

Greetings.  I can't recall if I received the contact?  If so, I apologize for misplacing it.  Could you send it again?  Much appreciated?

Best,
Jeff

Craver, Edison's CEO, is traveling and won't be back in the office until Wednesday.  I'm trying to arrange something with his office. Might need to take two cars if you've got other meetings set up.  I'll give you a call to discuss.
 
Jeff

Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento... I can make that. Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city. Any word from SOCALED.  

Give me a call this a.m. and we can figure out travel plans. 

BT 

Not sure.  Am checking around.  Will let you know when I find out.

Best,
Jeff

I hadn't heard about his changes.... did he swith co's... 

I will confirm meeting time. 

Thanks, BT

There is currently a meeting set for this Thursday at 11 AM (PST) at Edison headquarters in Rosemead.
 
Best,
Jeff

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE. 

1.      Form Enron Negotiation Team 

        My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.      Meet & Confer (10/29) 

        Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.      Reformed Stipulation 

        I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.      Meeting 

        My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees. 

Thanks, 

Jim 

FYI.  In case you'd like to listen in on what the IOUs have to say about the current and future fate of the PX Credit.
 
Best,
Jeff

There will be 3 vans downstairs on Thursday, Dec. 14 that will be 
transporting sponsors every 15-20 minutes starting at 10am.  We should try to 
be there at least 30 minues before our 1st break (11:39), so let's try to 
leave around 11am-ish?  

Nicole 

Davette, 
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter 
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at 
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of 
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage 
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the 
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly 
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and 
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try 
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have 
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, 
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really 
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us 
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt 
we hurt. : )

I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P.,  I would 
like to use the short ones.

Hey what do you think of this one, I even thought we  could give what ever
ones you won't use for the church's programs on Sunday.

Ladies,

     Here is the response from Ruby to our request for our Christmas
meeting.  Please mark your calendars accordingly.  Also please add Ruby and
her family to your prayer list.

Be Blessed,
Denise

Hi Denise,

I really appreciate your note - and yes, it will be great and a tremendous
BLESSING to see my sisters in Jesus... I will place that on my calendar; I
generally take some time off that time of the year, so I will be looking
forward to it.  What a wonderful celebration it will be... Since I live so
far; no one really has to help me; but if they want to, it would be greatly
appreciated; but mostly I hope that lots of ladies come... When you told me
that y'all eat anything, that's fine with me; just let me know a few days in
advance, how many people you think will be coming and I'll be ready...I love
to have people come together in my home... it will be a blessing...

There are several reasons that I'm not available lately - the main one being
of course, I'm working approximately 12-15 hours a day - it is a very trying
time for me right now and I need all the prayers that I can get; please
continue to do that; the other reason is; I'm physically tired; I'm 53 years
old and have been having lots of responsibility for most of my adult years!

I was been blessed to be able to come back to Houston 12 years ago and was
afforded an opportunity to buy a new home and was at that time within 15
minutes of my job (not anymore); hence I live "quite" a ways from church -
by distance approximately 38 mi.; by time depending on whose doing the
driving(smiles) and which way you come approximately 45 min. So after years
and years of having to drive so far at least 6 days a week, I'm tired...

God bless you and the Women's Ministry for thinking of me and my family at
such a special time in any Christian's life and I look forward to the
fellowship.  Keep me posted.

Love and God's grace to you,
Ruby

Good Morning Ruby,

     I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.

     Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.

     We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
see you soon.  We really have been missing you.

Be Blessed,
Denise

I think you should ask her.  I believe she wanted it to stay amongst those

Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to
pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side
of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house
by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go,
please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Please be informed that I will not be attending tomorrow's activities @ 2pm.  
However,  I will be here until my regular time taking advantage of this 
opportunity to begin archiving.

Thanks
Dana

Nikki - call me after you get this.

 Attached is a copy of my resume and thank you for all of your help in 
advance.

These are my hours: 8am to 5pm

Sorry that I forgot you guys!

FYI:  
If it's ok with everyone's needs, I would like to leave @4pm. If you think 
you will need my assistance past the 4 o'clock hour just let me know;  I'll 
be more than willing to stay.

Oh, It won't be necessary to bring anything.  I don't know what the room #'s 
are.  I plan to get off @ 4pm and check in the hotel a.s.a.p.  Here's my cell 
phone # so you can call me to see where we are  (713)-320-6450.  Call me 
later and I should have all the details for you.  Oh, Candis' size is 14/16.  
Thanks Denise....talk to you soon.

Hi Dana,

    She told me it is at the Marriott.  Do you know what room and what time
yet?  Also, what can I bring?  What size does your daughter wear?

Denise

Hi Denise,

Did Carolyn call you last night regarding Candis' hotel slumber party?

Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

To All DSS Users,

Currently there is no mechanism for changing your password on DSS.  

On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will 
function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.  Passwords for DSS 
users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.  You 
will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.  
Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in 
the specified time interval.

These e-mails will be sent as follows:
E-mail  #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date
 #2 - 1 week before expiration date
 #3 - 2 days before expiration date
 #4 - 1 day before expiration date
 #5 - The day the password expires

We now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.  When 
this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your 
current password, New password, and repeat New password.  There are certain 
criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.  
Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.  You may run 
this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be 
closed before it can be run again.

Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location 
that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.  This may be on your hard 
(C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.  As long as you remember where it is, it 
really doesn't matter where you save it.  When the time comes, Execute 
(double-click) the module to change your DSS password.

If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at 
x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.

Thank you.

		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.

Dear Friend,

A friend of yours, Bonnie Abraham, just took the Spiritual Gifts Analysis
Test at the Church Growth Institute web site. Your friend thought it was
very valuable and wanted to tell you about this unique FREE service!

Point your browser to the following web address, take the Spiritual Gifts
Analysis Test, and within minutes you'll know your dominant spiritual
gift and what you can do with it to minister to others. Here's the address:

http://www.teamministry.com/

I do hope you'll take advantage of this unique opportunity to learn about
yourself and how the Lord has gifted you!

Sincerely,

Larry Gilbert

President, Church Growth Institute

PS: Here's what your friend wanted to say to you:

Dana, Here is another inventory that I have taken in the past.
It's a very good one. Let me know what you think. BA 

I forgot to give you money for parking I am so embarrased and sorry.  I'll 
give it back to you this evening.  I have a  meeting at 11am and a class from 
1pm to 2pm today so if you call or email me within those time frames and I 
don't respond for a while, that's why.

Hello Dana,

 I trust that all is well for you and yours.  I'm e-mailing you to get a
message to Kevin for me about Lay Speaker's School.  As Kevin may be
aware there is a two year membership rule within the book of discipline
before an individual can apply for the ordained ministry within the
United Methodist connection.  Until such time that he has been a member
for  two years he may want to attend the Lay Speaker's School on March
17th and 25th that will give him some training in some strategic areas of
ministry that will provide him with some additional tools to use in his
quest for the ministry.
 If he is interested please ask him to contact me for more information.
I've been meaning to tell him directly but everytime we are together I
forget about it.  So since I'm at the computer I decided to e-mail you so
that you can remember (smile).
 Thanks for everything!

Thank you for the valentines email it is the 1st and only one I've gotten.  I 
guess you felt bad cause you wouldn't come eat lunch with me.  (Probably Not)

Jacque' call me after you get this.

Good Morning Marnie -

Yesterday I made a dental appt. for Monday, Dec. 11th @ 5pm but I need to 
leave at 4pm to get there on time.  I have to finish a root canal that was 
started several months ago.  Do you foresee a problem with me leaving at 4pm 
that day?

Do any of you have Co. 72R  December Journal Vouchers?  I am trying to help 
Brian Dawson locate it.

Thanks for you help.

Did you find the Helen Baylor cd?

Are any of you still holding posted journal entries from Jan. Close?  If so 
will you please let me know what companies they are.  This will be an FYI 
kind of thing for me incase any of the accountants come around looking for 
specific entries.  Thanks for your cooperation.

I've been here since 8:30am but my computer was very slow booting up and 
after it came on I couldn't get a connection to lotus notes.  I put in a call 
to Jimmy Manguba, our floor tech, while waiting for my computer to reboot.  I 
don't know what the problem was but this seemed to work.

Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be 
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the 
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to 
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room 
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project 
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go 
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please 
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I 
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.

dana

I didn't get whatever it was that you were trying to send me.

Thanks Dana for the update, would you let Kevin know also thanking him, also
I will not be at the meeting tonight me and Curtis are going to Good Hope
Church to meet with Shaun.  Will you let them know about the DJ from KSBJ,
and also Curtis was able to also confirm the former radio announcer from
KTSU Dewayne B. Cook. We may want to use both of them, or just one, the
committee needs to decide.  Let Bonnie know about the letterhead
confirmation so she can get that out to KSBJ.  I thought is we really should
utilize the DJ from KSBJ!  Thanks Dana talk to you later!  Grace

Rhonna,  
Attached is a copy of my resume along with a wealth of gratitude if you could 
keep me in mind for postings of the nature listed above.  Thanks again.

Dana Davis

Dorothy -

I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm 
not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my 
behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two 
weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would 
forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just 
keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.

Dana

Below is a message regarding the last (2) Cypress wires you gave me yesterday.

Hi, Dana - 

Craig Fox has the fundings you were looking for.  I will fax you the cover 
pages first thing tomorrow.

Pat
5-3369

Routing is complete and I am taking your wire to A.P. now.  You should have a 
copy in your chair.

Thanks.

Dana

Brian -

Your wire is awaiting Tim Proffitt's signature but as soon as he has signed 
his assistant will call me and I will let you know where it is next.

Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them.  
FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check 
out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  
Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional 
hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone 
will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for 
your cooperation.

Dana

i do not have them.

   
	
	

Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.

Thanks.

Dana

I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and 
submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on 
them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules.

Tammy Barta

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Good Morning Marnie -
 
I have received the information that I needed to officially submit my request 
for 1/2 vacation Friday.  If this is not feasible, please let me know.

Thanks

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

These are the prayer request as follows...

Sheryl Snoddy - for faith and total trust in God to supply all of her needs.  
Complete and total healing for her mate who indulges in alcohol abuse and 
verbal abuse toward her in front of their son Devon.

Hi Grace-

Kevin asked me to let you know that he spoke to Kim ?(Causey)? with KSBJ 
radio station.  She said that they (Kim Causey herself, the Program Mgr.) 
would MC for us for $150.00.  This is what they will need from us... 

A confirmation letter on church letterhead of the date, time, location and 
any special way the MC will be used; 7 days prior to the event with $150.00 
check or money order mailed or hand delivered to..
Attn: Charlotte Estrada

Please include the name of a contact person that Kim will need when she gets 
to the event.

We will adopt your suggestion and fast on Wednesday mornings form 8 to 12,
so that we all are on one accord, that way we're all praying at the same
time and fasting at the same time. Be blessed Dana:-)
Dana.Davis@enron.com on 12/05/2000 03:25:38 PM

You are right.  I did misunderstand.  Sounds great to me and just for my
information, what day and time is your group fasting?

edith-kelly@reliantenergy.com on 12/05/2000 03:05:28 PM

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

on Dec. 2nd at 6:30 pm. I want to extend an invitation to all of you who are
interested in coming. For those of you that would be interested, I will need
your address forwarded to Kathy (my sister) and copy me. Her email address is
 kathy-lacy@reliantenergy.com and you can copy me here to my my home email
address. I would also appreciate it if you would get the word out to others
that do not have email and to others that might be interested in coming. I
was asked to get this information 2 weeks ago but I have been on the run so
please forgive me for this late hour if you please. Thank you in advance for
your response.

Edith:-)

DANA , DANA, DANA I DELETED THE FILE BY MISTAKE IF YOU
ARE STILL AT WORK SEND IT AGAIN

You are forwarding these messages to the wrong Dana Davis.  Try Mark Dana 
Davis Jr.

The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed 
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.

Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named "reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.

Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee 
cause if you go, I GO!  

Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, 
Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were 
made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last 
Wednesday.  

"DON'T QUOTE ME"
Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches 
outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant 
Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut 
off

Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having 
nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T 
QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no 
reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll 
see you tonight at choir rehearsal.

Drink Plenty of Water"
>
>  I've heard it. I've read it. As long as I have been running, it's
>  always been the same message: "drink plenty of water."
>
>  All along most race courses are water stations, and most runners slow
>  down to drink a cup of cool water. Keeping your water level up is
critical
>  when you run. If you get slightly dehydrated, you will not run well. If
you
>  get moderately dehydrated, you will become disoriented. If you get
>  seriously dehydrated, you can die. It's serious business.
>
>  The first year I ran was 1991, and I was inexperienced (also younger,
>  slimmer, stupider, etc.) I passed water stop after water stop,
>  occasionally drinking a swallow or two. I felt good, and I wasn't going
to
>  waste
>  precious seconds drinking water, even though it was a hot, humid day.
>
>  Big mistake. As I neared the final mile, I "hit the wall." My energy
>  level dropped to zero, I began having to walk some, and I realized I
would
>  have to work hard just to finish. I did make it across the line, but only
>  with
>  a tremendous headache and hardly enough energy to walk. It was not much
>  fun.
>
>  I learned an important lesson that year. Stopping for water doesn't
>  actually slow you down. In fact, you will run a better race if you do
drink
>  water. The bottom line is that your body is simply not designed to
function
>  without water.
>
>  In the same way, your spiritual stamina depends on stopping for regular

>  time to invest in reading the Word and meeting with God in prayer. Like
the
>  runner intent on reaching the finish line, we tend to put off those
>  regular drinks of water until we are totally parched.
>
>  But in the long run, you will run a better race if you will stop for
>  spiritual water. In fact, finishing the Christian race at all may
>  depend on it. And runners who don't ever slow down to take a drink often
>  stumble
>  off the course far short of the finish line.
>
>  In this year's race, I saw a man become dehydrated just a mile from the
>  finish. Strangely, he didn't seem to recognize that anything was wrong.
>  He was swaying from side to side as he walked, mumbling over and over,
>  "I'm fine. I'm fine." He was so disoriented that he didn't even recognize

>  his own sick condition.
>
>  If you let yourself become spiritually dehydrated, you may not even be
>  able to recognize it. Stop today to drink some cool "living water." For
>  serious runners, it's a must.

One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God.  "Father, I have a
problem!"

 "What's the problem, Eve?"

 "Lord, I know you created me and provided this beautiful garden and
all of  these wonderful animals and that hilarious comedic snake, but
I'm
just not  happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution.  I shall create a man for
you."

"What's a man, Lord?"

"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.  He'll lie,
cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.
But...he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.
He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining,
I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.
He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and
kicking a ball about.  He  won't be too smart, so he'll also need your
advice to think
properly."

"Sounds great." says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. " What's
the catch, Lord?"

"Well...  you can have him on one condition."

"What's that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...  So you'll
have to let him believe that I made him first.  Just remember, it's our
little secret... Y'know....Woman to woman..."

Rufino will be out sick today; however in his absence,  I will be here to 
support your needs.

WhaTeverrr!

Have a wonderful day.  I'm gone to the Cadillac Bar for our Christmas 
Luncheon.

Dana, If you need help preparing for the trip please let me know.
As far as the hair thing I have to have mine done tonight for sure,
tomorrow is bible study, Thursday Chanel has a class, she'll already
miss Saturday because they will be out of town, so if you can't do it for me
let me know
believe me I understand. It's just convenient because you're right there,
plus those lil-nubs
do a wondrous job. Oh! please let me have a copy of the directions for
back-up just in case
we'll have an extra one. Please advise :>

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am
also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

directions to our retreat in Galveston please, sweetie, little kitty?

Thank you!

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Good morning,

    Indeed it is a good morning, waking up and finding you there. However I
am not from Arkansas, therefore I can't understand that coded debris, can you
simply write in words!!!!!

Hi Joe & Jackie-
Joe, when I spoke to you last night, the email below is what I wanted Jackie 
to see.  Also I can't put my finger on Jerry and Danise's #.  Will you guys 
forward this message to Danise for me.  Thanks a lot and I look forward to 
seeing you guys on Wednesday.

God Bless, 
Dana
All,

      Here is the information on the blue jean shirts.  The exact price is
as follows:

M - XL         $22.65
XXL             $23.90
XXXL           $25.15

Please turn in your money to me as soon as possible.  The total for all the
shirts we have ordered is $551.  I have already made arrangements to pay for
half up front, due to such a high dollar order.

Pass the word on to those not on e-mail (Evelyn Morris, Evelyn Jackson, Nina
Nazir-ud-Din, Pamela Watts, Annette Richardson, Georgia Gillum, Danise
Johnson, Jackie Stewart, Marylyn Green, Ethel Ford, Cheryl Sumbler, and
Cheryl Curry). We need to try and have the money by Powertime on Wednesday.
If you need an accomodation, please let me know.

If you know of anyone else wanting a shirt, please get with me as soon as
possible.  I thought maybe the following might want a shirt (Rev Jacque,
Bobbie Poledore, Katherine Dailey, Valerie Piper).  It would be nice if all
women had one.

Also, thank Joe Stewart when you see him, for making all the arrangements
for us.

Thanks,
Denise

Do you have a problem with me taking this to the prayer ministry tonight?

marylyn y green <witness4him3@juno.com> on 12/10/2000 02:31:46 PM
I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the 
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new 
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  

Hebrews 4:12 - 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that 
God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to 
the swift, 
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my 
sisters!

Love You,

Dana

Attached is the template to be used for inputting manual FI and CS journal 
entries for cutover weekend.  The template will be used for both June 
Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as 
well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but 
need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany 
imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).  There are some 
Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as 
entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.  These 
specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will 
record these entries automatically.  If you have any questions about whether 
or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy 
Morrow.

There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that 
need to be made.  We are requesting all manual entries converted from June 
Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.  This will 
allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the 
data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.  Please include 
copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual 
entries.  For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are 
requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion 
entries are converted and complete.

I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help 
converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been 
reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in 
SAP for June.  Please call me or email me to set up a time.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Several months ago a compensation survey was commissioned by Rick Causey to see how Enron's accounting compensation compared to our peers, with our main objective being to retain and attract the best possible talent.   The survey was comprehensive, including Fortune 100 companies and two big-5 accounting firms.  The results of the survey have highlighted that some of our salaries are below today's market. So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations). All salary adjustments will be effective September 1st. 
I know that this has been a busy and challenging year for everyone and is likely to remain that way for awhile. We have made tremendous progress toward our major goals this year of cleaning up our accounts, understanding our balance sheet, getting our arms around our cash flow, dealing with tremendous volume growth in trading and building timely and value-added management reporting products. I recognize and appreciate all of your efforts. 

The 2001 fourth quarter earnings release date has been set for Tuesday, January 22, 2002.

I'm taking a half day vacation Monday but I will be in after lunch; around 1pm.

I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.

Thanks,
Dana

I'll be looking forward to receiving that report and thank you for the update.

Mrs. Davis

Don't think of it as "dropped."  This is a new six weeks.  Remember, I don't have a lot of grades at this point, so any zeros really bring down their grades.  Once she turns in her work, it will com up.  You will be getting a detailed report on Friday.

>>> "Davis, Dana" <Dana.Davis@ENRON.com> 10/09/01 04:07PM >>>
So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this
due that paper not being turned in?

She currently has a 65.  I need her timeline paper and her "7th grade"
questions.  Thanks!

Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -

grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that
she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.

Oh God Carolyn, 
Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.

You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.

Love your sister,

Dana

Dana,

Just wanted to say that I really miss you.  It saddens me that you are not
sitting next to me anymore.  Although I know that we are still friends, you
have been so much more.  I have grown spiritually because of your teaching.

I'm not sure what to say, except:

I REALLY MISS YOU!!!!

I tried to add you to my MSN Instant Messenger service but Enron's email firewall has heightened it's security disabling me to log into outside email accounts.  Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service. 

That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there?

Here is my P.O. box number

I wondered whose email address this was when I saw it on one of Uncle Joes emails.  Thanks so much for the E postcards that you sent me.  I guess you have talked to Monte?  Email me back so we can talk.  Oh, I need your physical address so I can send you something.

Love you.

Mrs. Dana

Please let me know exactly what paper you are speaking of so that I may address this issue with intelligently.  Thanks for the emails.

Hey, Dana - 

No rush at all.  You can send it interoffice if you like. (EB 3339E)
Early next week would even be okay - I just wanted to make sure we had gotten it this month (since it apparently got lost en route to us last month).

Thanks!

OK.  Pat how fast do you need it?

Please make a copy of the Hanson deposit for Pat.

Hi Dana,

Here is a copy of your review to read over prior to our meeting.

Thanks,

Dana,
This is for you.

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

It wasn't "Shackles" silly.  The 1st song is "What A Friend We Have In Jesus".

I don't.  Why did you think about me when you heard Shackles?

Do you have any of their cd's?  The one with the song "Shackles"?  I was listening to it this morning and I thought about you.

Yes.  I love their music.

Have you heard of Mary Mary?

I listen to both.

My Instant Messenger isn't working for some reason but all I wanted was to ask you do you listen to gospel music and what kind if you do?  Traditional or contemporary?

Just a note of follow up.  The employee sevice center informs me that 
corporate is working on your vacation balance adjustment.  Hopefully, we will 
hear that the correction has been made in the next day or two.

Yes, yes.  Sorry for not replying.  I'm good for two.  

Danny and I are in for two a piece and Scott wants one.  Do either of you
want in on the steaks?  If so, let me know how many (they're 8-10 ounces
pre-cooked).

Luis

Do you guys want to go in on some New York Strip steaks?  I can pick up some
in bulk at Sam's and marinade them over night.  There are usually 4 eight to
ten ounce steaks per package for around $20.  They are pretty good quality.

If we do it, should I get one or two packages?  I'm thinking two (unless
Scott is bringing Hunter, who we can BBQ instead).

Sounds good to me.  5 o'clock.   Just kidding.

The "silent one" speaks.

Richard Donoghue <Rdonoghue@mphlegal.com> on 12/13/2000 10:37:08 AM
Guys, unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to bow out of our camping
trip this weekend. I have been rather ill over the last week and a half, and
I'm not sure that I'm up for the elements and all of the alcohol that are
involved in this weekend's festivities. I have been hoping to get better,
but between work and my cold, I don't think I'm up for it. Have fun and
please try not to make too much fun of the "silent one" while you are in a
wood kicking frenzy.

I also have a small tent that can be borrowed if "the silent one" emerges
from the depths of the legal system to join us on our quest for physical
pain, inebriation, and large, uncontrollable fires.

Clint has spoken for the tent.

Wow, I almost forgot.  Thank you.  I will contact her soon.  

Erin Williams <erinwill@yahoo.com> on 05/23/2001 03:18:00 PM

I am so sorry that it has taken me so long to e-mail you.  I hope you didn't 
think that I forgot.
I spoke to Amy and she would love to meet you.  Her e-mail address is

Hope you have a good Memorial Day weekend,

Amy,
 
Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke 
with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting 
together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at 
Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three 
years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 
and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in 
hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good 
friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you 
think, and we can go from there.

Clint

Thanks Amy-

Craig -

Our records indicate that you have not taken your pre-employment drug test for UBS.  Can you please do so ASAP, or if you have already completed, can you please let me know the date that you went so that we can update our records.

Thanks!
Amy

CRAIG!
What the hell have you been up to?  I just got your email address from Carl. 
  I havent talked to him in about 2 years either.  Last year I tried 
everything to get your address so you could come to my wedding.  I got 
married last July.  My wife, Jennifer, is just finishing up at the U, so she 
is a little younger than us, but she's really cute, intelligent, blah, 
blah....  Anyway, are you still in Portland?  I heard you were working at 
Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing 
anymore, so either give me a call, or I can give you a call if you send your 
number.  I'd love to catch up.  My cell:  206-293-1459.  Call after 2:30 
(yes, that is the end of my work day)  Hope to hear from you soon.

Hey Carl,

I hope you got my info out to Oliver.  I'd like to hear from him.  I'm still "working" for Enron.  Actually we are just sitting around according to our shift schedule and answering any calls that might come in cuz' there ain't no more tradin' goin' on...

I got an offer to play baseball in Germany this spring/summer.  I think I'm going to do it.  Ich spreche wenig Deutsch, aber mehr Ubungen huete.  (I speak little German, but I practice today)

I plan on sticking around here until 1) they no longer pay me 2) they ask me to leave or 3) all of the above

Hope all is well, 
Deano

Why aren't you staying at your parent's house?  I got a e-card from Toby - thought that was pretty cool...

Check this one out  - I caught and released this nice Chinook hen on the Eel River in Southern Humbolt County last Sunday.
Call me anytime.
Carl

Cara,

Alicia @ Dynegy ultimately decided to cut this schedule as per my call with her at 16:54 PPT
I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55
and Steve @PPM @ 17:21, (because he called me)

Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point.
I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)

I had a long conversation w/
Matt (Pacificorp)
Steve (PPM)
and Karen (Chelan)
-We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.

Note:
Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)

Call me with any question,
Craig

	Hey I thought about our conversation last night and I think we should cover the start and stop times to your season and some other details that might be important.  This is my work e-mail...my home is cdean12@earthlink.net.  I'll write you again from home.

Deano

Hello! There are so many people I'd like to spend hours and hours
writing to and updating on all that I've been doing lately. As we all
know, that'll be very slow and coming! So - in the meantime - check out
my new and improved website! www.simplifiedliving.org I'd love comments
and feedback....as well as any referrals you feel like sending my way!
:)

Carl and I are doing great here...house is good, dogs are good and
pregancy is going just fine! Baby is due in April so we'll keep you
posted...we're letting the boy/girl part be a surprise!

Hope you are doing well and that the holiday season will be full of love
and happiness for you!

warmly,
chrissy

Hello all!

Jon Koomey, the instructor for your Tricks of the Trade (Energy Math) course, has requested participant feedback regarding his class. If you have any comments or suggestions, please e-mail Jon at numbers@numbersintoknowledge.com and copy me as well.

For your convenience, I have included questions from other course evaluations to help guide your thoughts. Feel free to include other comments or suggestions.

Was the presentation of information clear and at the right level of detail?  Did the presenter keep the course interesting?
For a course held entirely in one day, the level of detail was effective.  The course was interesting with the real life examples and the challange problem solving in groups.  The visual aids could use some improvement.  I have no specific ideas, but I found the consistent nature of the material to create a lull in the presentation.
Were there any topics discussed that you would have liked greater detail on?
Current events.  I liked the bit on the Kyoto Treaty
Were there any topics covered that you did not find beneficial or relevant?
I've systematically erased them from my memory...too late to recall
Were there any topics that you would have liked information on that were not included in the seminar?
Currency conversions as they relate to production costs
Did you find the group and individual exercises useful?  Do you have any changes or recommendations for the exercises that you would have found more beneficial?
The individual exercises were the most useful.  It encourages the attendees to work together and think through a problem.
How well was the day structured?  For example, did the course cover too much or too little information, would you have preferred more or less group work, etc.
More group work.  Although you are limited w/one day groups
On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best), how would you rate this course for usefulness and relevance to your work?
8.5
Other Comments:
      Good course...I was a bit worried in the first hour as we focused on compilation errors for data gathering

Are you married yet?

Amy, 
Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.

Clint

Jennifer,
I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet up the second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out again on Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I missed you.  Talk to you soon.

Clint

I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there, but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from Austin.  You need to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a Halloween party this weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you planning any more trips back to Houston?

Clint

Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the second night,
but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a lot of people
had early flights out the next morning.

This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!  Or at least
some sleep.

What was the name of that band you were playing in your car?  I doubt I
can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

Have a great weekend!

As of October 1 we need to be especially careful in using non-firm transmission right only.  Make sure to repeat transmission requests with the BPA as "non-firm on Enron all the way".  Mistakes may cost as much as  $1200/mw if you agree to use Enron's firm rights.  

Also note that some of BPA's network transmission fees have increased by $2.  

C Dean

Mike,
We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down.  This would include location (by zone), ramp rates, and load factors.  Also, we need to know how fast the load can react to instructions, and how flexible the load is, i.e. can the load be moved up and down on an interval basis without causing problems?  We would also need to know their load forecast.  For example, when is the load available to be reduced, summers, on-peak, etc.?  Obviously if this is limited, we would want to value it accordingly.

Thanks,
Clint

Joelle,
Hey, I just wanted to say that if I came on too strong or did anything out of line, I'm sorry.  Obviously, I don't know you very well, so I wanted to make sure you knew that.  I would enjoy seeing you again, but its up to you.  Just let me know what you think.

Clint

What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.  

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the rumors have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger will get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As far as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will be interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.  

Hey there!  How are things down in Houston?  I can't imagine the rumors
that are going on there.  We were so busy here last week.  I am ready
for my two weeks off.  I am going to S.A. for Thanksgiving (did I
already mention that?).  I am not sure if I want to fly with what
happened today?  It's crazy out there, but I have to get home to Texas.
I hope you have a great time in Dallas and I'll chat with ya when I get
back.

Jen

	-----Original Message-----
	I definitely dressed up for the party.  I looked good!  I was a
sheriff.
	If you can't find that CD up there, you can always pick it up
back in
	Texas.  So, I'm trying to remember, does your mom live in
Houston, and dad
	in S.A.?  Is that right?  I'm going to Dallas for Thanksgiving,
and I'm
	just glad I don't have to fly.  I can't imagine what the lines
will be like
	that week.  I'm off work this Friday, so if you get a chance to
call,
	better make it Thursday.  Glad to hear that you're feeling
better.  Talk to
	you soon.
	    -----Original Message-----
	   Hey there!  How was your Halloween party?  Did you dress up?
I hung out
	   with some friends, but no costumes.  Dexter Freebish - that's
it.  I'll
	   have to look for it up here.  We went to the APB party, but
left early
	   to get some food.  Things calmed down that last night
compared to
	   Tuesday.

	   I'll be back on days at the end of next week and then I'll
have two
	   weeks off.  I cannot wait!  What are your plans for
Thanksgiving?  I'm
	   flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days.  I
can't decide
	   whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas.
I feel so
	   lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

	   I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
lost my
	   voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
Needless
	   to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
everyone was
	   happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
other than
	   the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

	   Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
office on
	   Thursday.

Julie,

As I am getting off night shift today, I will be unable to attend the HR presentation.  I believe I filled out all of the necessary paperwork (W-4, direct deposit, and employment application) to get started and I dropped the beneficiary and benefits paperwork on your desk this morning.  Please write me if there is anything else that you need from me.

Craig Dean

Several UBS HR required forms will be distributed during this meeting.  These forms are required to process payroll and enroll in the benefit plans.  If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me or one of the UBS HR personnel.   See you then!

I responded on 12/24 but haven't seen anything yet...

11/13/2000 10:55 AM
Dwayne, in response to your request, I am providing a quick summary of our 
discussion on Friday.  As I had mentioned, this is a competitive process and 
time is of the essence.  If we get resolution to these points, I would be 
prepared to sit down over a finite period of time (three or four days) to try 
and hammer out the transaction.

Specifically:

AEP Point #2: ENA would accept a triggering event and MAC clause for the 
lease.  This would under certain conditions allow AEP to purchase the leased 
assets at the present value of the future lease payments plus the fair value 
in year thirty of the underlying assets at an agreed upon discount rate.  The 
triggering events would include bankruptcy, insolvency or Enron Corp falling 
below investment grade.  An Enron Corp guarantee would be offered to secure 
that covenant.  We would similarly ask for similar credit language in the 
lease agreement, with an AEP parental guarantee, securing the lease 
obligation from AEP.  These paragraphs would be constructed in a similar 
manner to triggering events and MAC clauses in master commodity documents.

ENA would also acknowledge that it would not sell the lease or physical 
assets underlying the lease to any other party but AEP.  I would anticipate 
that this would be managed through a ROFR structure.  This would ensure that 
AEP would have access to the assets if sold and that AEP can feel confortable 
that they will be dealing with Enron for the period of the lease.

Notwithstanding above, Enron needs the flexibility to pledge or sell the AEP 
lease stream in order to monetize your obligation to cash if desired.  This 
makes the set-off language difficult.  With the triggering event and MAC 
clause, the need for set-off to protect AEP in the event of Enron default 
should not be required.

AEP Point #5:  ENA would agree to a three month non-compete which prohibits 
ENA from soliciting business with the suppliers or producers connected to the 
Pipeline.  This non-compete would apply to transactions over one month in 
duration. This would apply to ENA only and no other Enron Corp affiliates.

AEP Point #6:  I believe that ENA has already agreed in principal to your 
request under this point.

AEP Point #1:  ENA would require indemnity limitation, including 
representation and warranties and basic construction, similar to our last 
draft language previously provided to you.  Would also request a two year 
window rather than three on environmental claims.

AEP Point #3:  ENA would counter with a $40 million break up fee if AEP does 
not get requisite SEC approval by April 1, 2001.

AEP Point #4:  On HSR and FERC approvals, AEP's position as layed out in the 
letter is not practical since it would be very difficult to pull out certain 
pieces of the pipe from the deal and ensure that both parties get the benefit 
of the bargain.  If AEP is unwilling to give an asset divestment covenant and 
given AEP's limited gas infrastructure position,  ENA's position is that AEP 
should take the risk that they will be able to get the approvals.  

Other:  ENA will not agree as a condition to this transaction a settlement of 
any FERC issues between AEP and EPMI; however, ENA would always be willing to 
discuss such items in a different forum.

If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact myself or 
Tim Detmering.  

Regards
Dave Delainey

Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 
2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the 
ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.

Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 
2001 plans.

Regards
Delainey

Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial 
expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.

Regards
Delainey

Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.

Regards
Delainey
Christopher F Calger
11/12/2000 04:42 PM
Dave,

You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount:

Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, 
general marketing and charitable contributions.

Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and 
certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the 
$278K)

Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 
2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 
15, not 18.

Hope this clarifies the plan.

Regards,

Chris

2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our 
approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the 
nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and 
the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will 
be managed.

Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.

Dave,

I have taken the "communicate your ideas to the right person" to heart.  One 
of the main reasons I came to Enron was to help expand it marketing efforts.  
I have taken a few minutes to write my idea, because verbal ideas can get 
lost in the shuffle.  I feel strongly about this opportunity and this notion 
is what attracted me back to the Big E.  I believe all the pieces of this 
idea are present at Enron, but we can maximize our resources.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.

Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

I called Ronnie Lee to invite him to the New York Christmas party (he'll 
probably come) and we had a lengthy conversation about what they're doing 
right now.
It sounds like they are down to 4 counterparties on their previous "asset 
management" solicitation:  Enron, Southern, Duke and Williams.  Williams is 
their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like 
Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a  below-market 
fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and 
Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. 
Although Ronnie claims everyone is "right there together", the small pricing 
difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with 
Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He 
says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the 
table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas 
curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be 
worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said 
Jackson has  now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to 
come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe.  

I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested 
to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep 
about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk 
thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be 
in touch to try and set up a time. 

Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it 
probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit!

kay, see when this is and if I can go?

Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% 
year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct 
group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate 
allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be 
able to achieve this goal?

Regards
Delainey

David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am 
looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related 
cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections 
that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this 
was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.

If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you 
please pass this on to the right spot.

Soaring natgas prices revive interest in coal
December 07, 2000 3:31:00 PM ET
By Andrew Kelly 

HOUSTON, Dec 07 (Reuters) - Soaring prices for natural gas and concerns about 
future supplies are prompting U.S. electricity generators to take another 
look at coal which had fallen out of favor as gas dominated the nation's 
plans for new power plants. 

Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build 
two new 600 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in 
the United States in several years. 

Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the 
decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of 
your eggs in one basket. 

"We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part 
of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply," Grigg told Reuters in 
an interview. 

Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the 
economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the 
decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in 
recent years. 

Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United 
States are slated to burn natural gas. 

But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million 
British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg 
suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. 

"Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think 
you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal," Grigg said. 

BACK IN THE PICTURE 

Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high 
natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put 
coal back in the picture. 

"A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal 
plant. Today there's talk about it," he said. 

For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the 
convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of 
faith, that is quite an admission. 

Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. 
power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. 

Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but 
construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible 
following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 
1986. 

Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is 
projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm 
for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest "combined-cycle" gas 
turbines. 

Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand 
for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by 
increased use of gas for power generation. 

Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the 
industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing 
amounts of gas. 

FLAT GAS PRODUCTION 

In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly 
steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 
3 billion cubic feet. 

The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs 
currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of 
over 800 from just over 600 a year ago. 

But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers 
fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. 

Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska 
will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in 
the second half of this decade. 

Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States 
has reserves equivalent to well over 200 years of domestic consumption. 

Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report 
that the United States will need 300,000-400,000 megawatts of new electricity 
generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 800 and 1,000 
new plants. 

Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even 
half of that new capacity, he calculated. 

"Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will 
also be necessary to meet demand growth," Niles wrote. "We see no alternative 
fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time 
constraints." 

Wisconsin Electric's Grigg said it might not be long before other power 
generators followed his own company's lead and drew up plans for new 
coal-fired plants. 

"I have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that 
economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for 
coal," he said.

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.

Dave,

Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
(if any) it might be worth discussing.

Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron 
Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in 
any new opportunities that come about.

Thanks!

Mike

Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a 
handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have 
your day in court to discuss margin soon.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

I received the 2001 plan that Dave sent up here.  Chris and I talked and are 
working through all of the questions that Dave had.  I noticed that the gross 
margin plan for west power trading was $170 million.  When you were here I 
talked about $100 million total and then you talked me up to $120 million 
total with $100 from the trading efforts and $20 from middle 
market/services.  Why the change from $120 to $170?  Perhaps it was a 
typo?????  While I intend to make as much money as I possibly can next year, 
the $170 number seemed high.  Particularly given the regulatory freak show 
that is going down in California right now.

Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the 
Florida market at this point.

Hey Dick, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I did want to reiterate 
out need for  the GE 7FA's  for our Florida projects. Although I understood 
from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't 
yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We 
are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition 
to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. 
Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to 
execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the 
que position) by then. 

I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with 
earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you 
app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC 
contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has 
significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and 
anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.

Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two 
projects. Thanks Dick.

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.

Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis 
of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the 
upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in 
the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, 
producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous 
discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's 
products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak 
with Jean Mrha.

The names include:
 Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region;
 Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);

 Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region;
 Gary Bryan - director - east region;
 Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region;
 Bill Brogan - manager - east region;
 Kreg Hall - analyst - east region;
 Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).

Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the 
buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks 
until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given 
their experience and availability.

The EES VP PRC Meeting will be held Wednesday, December 13 from 10:00 a.m. - 
5:00 p.m., in the Regency Room of the Hyatt.

If you have any questions, please contact me at x31738.

Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing 
protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I 
sign off on the filing before it goes out.

Summary of emails detailed below:

Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities 
seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already 
filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing.  
We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec.

Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating 
that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the 
utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO. ((Ameren, FP&L, LGE/KU, 
Cinergy, TXU, VEPCO, and Duke).  Protests will be due over the next few 
months.

Please let me know if you want to receive copies of the protests or drafts.

Kevin said this looks good w/ these changes:

2nd para;  "Commission an (NOT AND) Open-Access Transmission Tariff"
and last para:  Add after December 15, 2001 deadline  "or if a transmission 
owner does not join a fully functioning RTO that meets all of the 
Commission's requirements" 

This needs to get filed today, if possible, as a request for rehearing in 
Ameren Docket ER00-2687-001.  Note:  There were no interventions or protests 
in this docket and FERC issued a letter order accepting the filing on Nov. 
2.  What is odd and should be pointed out for why we are intervening at this 
time is that there may have been a problem with when or how the notice was 
issued.  Neither Nancy P. or our paralegal Jan saw this notice.  I found it 
after the intervention date.  It is certainly odd that there were no 
interventions in this at all.  One concern for Dan/Joe/Jim:  Since this is 
going in as a late intervention and request for rehearing, what is the 
likelihood of the Commission tossing the whole idea out quickly because of 
the late intervention, which may hurt our overall cause.

Next, this is the list of those utilities that we plan to file this pleading 
in (We are not protesting Xcel/NSP/Pub Serv of Co):

FP&L MAYBE Docket No. 97-3359-003 Protests due 11/20
Cinergy (due in Jan)
TXU (due in Jan)
VEPCO (due next Aug)
Duke (due next Dec)
LGE/KU (due next March)

NOTE:  Kevin wants to do a full blown assessment  against HQ , which is due 
sometime this Nov.  Please keep all eyes out. for the HQ filing.

THANK YOU.

Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRON
On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=

Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=

functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20

Dave/John, we have been awarded the RFP to assume the role of contract 
manager for the Ontario NUG's (some 1700 MW's) for a 3 year term. A 
definitive agmt will  be executed by the end of November. This was a 
high-profile RFP and I think that it confirms our investment in positioning 
ourselves in Ontario.

This was truly a team effort (east/west orig, east trading, legal, 
regulatory) in responding to the RFP with a ton of long days needed in a 
short time-frame. The response to RFP was structured to manage all risks and 
well thought out which ultimately led to our successful bid.

I attach an executive summary that gives further details. If you have any 
questions, please call myself, Paul or Eric.

thanks, milly

David W Delainey
11/02/2000 12:22 PM
Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Delainey

11/02/2000 09:17 AM
Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to "stay 
in the loop" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Milnthorp

I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.  

Regards
Delainey
David Gorte
11/02/2000 07:28 PM
Dave,

As of today, the Transaction Approval Process requires that any embedded 
financing over $500,000 needs to be DASHed.  RAC, however, is close to 
finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings--both prepaids and 
tilted swaps--that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval 
document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and 
maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.  For 
example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AAA counterparty with 
standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated 
approval document.  This abbreviated approval document would only be 
available for transactions meeting these criteria if:  (i) structured 
financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is 
manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (iii) the pricing met 
a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate 
credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.

The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of 
relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is 
impractical or inefficient.  It is presently contemplated that the 
abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:  the 
Originator's and  a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with 
business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions 
approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.  In 
any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you 
for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the 
preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

  

David W Delainey
11/02/2000 09:25 AM
Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.  

Regards
Delainey

	
	

We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
commodity and a finance portion:

Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million
Avista/Kaiser    7/2000   7/2000 to 7/2006   $31.3 million   
BPA/Kaiser    9/2000   7/2001 to 9/2001   $36 million
Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?

Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.

Janet and Bruce,

On behalf of the Analyst and Associate Program, I want to take this 
opportunity to let you know what a wonderful job Michelle Parks did while 
recruiting at Cornell.  I don't know whether you are aware but we had an 
interviewer not show up.  He also had not called to cancel.  Michelle was in 
the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.  Although she 
had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we 
did not have to cancel the schedule.  
Cornell is one of our core schools and it would have been quite embarrassing 
to cancel a full schedule.

We truly appreciate Michelle selflessness and believe she more than exhibits 
Enron's vision and values.  She should be commended.  

Thanks

Charlene Jackson

Great job guys  - keep it coming!

We have completed the sale of our Brigham investment for $20.0 million 
(JEDI/ENA).  ENA's net share of the proceeds for $12.5 million.   The 
transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value.

My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely 
distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its 
point in the midst of a hurricane.  In the case of the Brigham deal the 
hurricane was a Force Five.

Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist 
in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done.

The next "balanced pencil" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) 
sale by mid-November.  We're on track:  so far, the hurricane has not  blown 
the pencil away.

Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and

Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a 
reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the 
Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large 
visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg 
for mid market and yourself for origination.

I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you 
do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.

Lets discuss.

corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-99 and signed by Garland and 
Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).  It stipulates that Bear, 
Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by 
ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses).

Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we 
have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction.  
Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, 
it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.  I have instructed Stacy Hardy 
in accounting to wire the money prior to year end.

Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it 
two days ago.  Call me if you have questions.

MLM 

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.

We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
commodity and a finance portion:

Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million
Avista/Kaiser    7/2000   7/2000 to 7/2006   $31.3 million   
BPA/Kaiser    9/2000   7/2001 to 9/2001   $36 million
Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?

John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him 
about several changes in the next couple of weeks.

Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the 
company we would be a $100 stock.

On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the 
current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager 
promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process 
mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.

I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination 
of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key 
points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible 
key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where 
necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the 
program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet 
commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

The goals of any restructuring are:
 a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the 
business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the 
program;
 b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;
 c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling 
and interviewing;
 d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly 
grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in 
market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;
 e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding 
talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them 
up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the 
program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;
 f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, 
retention and performance tool;
 g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, 
non-traditional sources of talent and
 h) increase cost effectiveness.

The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, 
people and teams, business tracks, etc.

I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the 
key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the 
least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.

I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with 
a strawman.

Let me know your thoughts.

Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
     On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.  The team is preparing an analysis on 
where we have flexibility and preparing a response.  We should be able to 
respond before the end of the week.

Thanks
Dave Delainey

David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your 
team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely 
distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.

Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec 
Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA

Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the 
following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very 
important processes, more consistently and effectively:

Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is)
Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and 
pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will 
also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount.
The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on 
providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should 
spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this 
pipeline can be refined and better targeted.
The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be 
very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to 
the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals 
within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases).
Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their 
interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the 
candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment 
will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to 
the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and 
resolved  ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the 
candidate.
Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be 
contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be 
managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.
John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which 
will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out 
of town, these will be conducted via telephone.

Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff
Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive 
Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:
For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing 
Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John 
Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail 
and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) 
Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason 
or justification for offering them a contract.
In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead 
or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.
Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, 
your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft 
financial terms on the familiar contract request form.
Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial 
terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in 
the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps 
described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.
Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a 
fresh draft will be produced.

The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:

Power Trading  - Kim Melodick  57273
Gas Trading  - Jeanie Slone  53847
West Power  - Amy Fitzpatrick  Portland
West Orgin  - Amy Fitzpatrick  Portland
East Orgin  - Fran Mayes  37211
M&A, Principle Inv - Dave Hill  34218

Capital Services - Dave Hill  34218 
Generation Assets - Dave Hill  34218

BAR   - Sheila Walton  30649
Legal   - Sheila Walton  30649
Comp Analysis  - Sheila Walton  30649
Research  - Sheila Walton  30649

Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the 
opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks 
to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and 
expectations.

I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.  

The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over 
the next year.

Dave:

I would like to put the wheels in motion to investigate the opportunity we 
discussed yesterday.  

Although my initial reaction is that I truely enjoy Portland and my current 
position (it's cold in Canada) and believe I can add real value here over the 
next year or two, the opportunitiy to build help build a business and broaden 
my experience with a move to Toronto is positive.  I need more information to 
feel comfortable making this decision.  So, please advise me as to when I can 
contact Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp (and who else I should contact) to get 
into the details..  

Thanks for the opportunity!

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

Regards
Mark and Dave

important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing,

Chris, I can assure you that I was not part of the "organization".  Got the 
books - going throough now and I will get back to you.  Keep Avista's feet to 
the fire.  speak with you soon.

Dave,

Coyote:  BPAmoco flaked so Avista is trying to move forward to take the whole 
deal (some public embarrassment if they dont close since they announced it 
last week).  At the same time, DLJ is bringing in some of the industry 
players that originally expressed interest.  One of those parties that called 
Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.  We will have a handle on 
preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday.  

Pastoria and LVCogen:  Deal books should have arrived.  Do you want to meet 
on these?  who would you like to meet with?  Parquet for Pastoria and 
Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen?  

Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.  Pastoria 
costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that 
turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs 
(argument for a value-grab!)

FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I 
called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.  The general 
number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him.

Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.  I dont 
understand his decision but Scott said that the "organization" thought it 
would be a better opportunity in Houston.

Chris

Dave:

I would like to put the wheels in motion to investigate the opportunity we 
discussed yesterday.  

Although my initial reaction is that I truely enjoy Portland and my current 
position (it's cold in Canada) and believe I can add real value here over the 
next year or two, the opportunitiy to build help build a business and broaden 
my experience with a move to Toronto is positive.  I need more information to 
feel comfortable making this decision.  So, please advise me as to when I can 
contact Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp (and who else I should contact) to get 
into the details..  

Thanks for the opportunity!

Chris

Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of 
the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated 
you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's 
A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire 
company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.

Regards
Delainey

Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do 
with the 20/20 deal.  I believe a reserve should have been set up for this 
payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive 
to NBPL.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip

Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this 
one the better.

Thanks
Dave

The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC 
commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before 
the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the 
press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are 
also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which 
focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is 
that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and 
therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market 
power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of 
California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected 
that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other 
hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the 
staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment 
and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our 
best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting 
the report and order under wraps until wednesday.

Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to 
spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the 
ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you 
speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You 
have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find 
find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be 
interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and 
strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be 
valuable in building connections.

Delainey

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.

How do you want the Technical Analysis group handled for yearend PRC?  It is 
my understanding that they report directly to the OOC and as such, will not 
be included in any of the other business unit PRC's (i.e. EIM, East Orig, 
etc.).  Options are:

1. Have a tech analysis prc for the approx. 24 employees (portland and 
houston based) and the ratings are final  (however, who will give ratings for 
Mays and Virgo)
2. We ask one of the commercial teams to allow them to be discussed in their 
meeting (which will give cross  calibration and consensus).
3. Explore the possiblity of including them in a "functional" meeting with 
OEC or EECC?

Please give me your thoughts!

Fran

David, thanks for the people listing.

Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each 
market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads 
and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 
budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES 
business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current 
balance sheet would be helpful as well.

I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.

You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.

Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just 
play it by ear.

At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following 
discussions/agenda:
 a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, 
participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and 
political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & 
historical prices and volumes;
 b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation 
strategy;
 c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product 
development;
 and d) brief review of other S. American markets.

I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and 
any one else you think appropriate.

Let me know what I need to do otherwise.

Thanks

I would suggest day one in Sao Paulo and day two and three in Rio.  I would 
also suggest the Cesar Park in Rio, better location, although Copacabana 
Palace is more famous and classy hotel.  Trip from Rio to Sao Paulo is like 
from Houston to Dallas, inconsequential, spend the first night in Sao Paulo, 
hotel next to the office, and second night in Rio, travel to Rio on Friday 
morning.  Dave, call to discuss or I'll call you, including what would you 
like to do on Saturday, sightseeing, golf, surfing, work?

I thought this Itinerary might be easier to read.  If you could send me the 
phone number to the Rio de Janeiro office, I would greatly appreciate it.

Also, Dave wanted to know if you could arrange transportation for them.  He 
wants to be sure that we arrange transportation with someone you know.

Thanks very much for your help and please feel free to call me with any 
questions (Kay 713-853-0643).

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.

Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, 
traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I 
think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the 
FERC that will allow the market to work.

Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed 
to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.

Thanks.

Regards
Delainey

Scott Neal told me that you asked recently where we stood on development of a 
transportation market in light of 637.  I would be happy to meet with you and 
let you know in more detail what I have been working on, but here is a quick 
synopsis.

We are putting new transportation products out on EOL--this should be ready 
for December business (assuming Lavo has no objections--I just sent him the 
information on the product).  They are simple products with no computerized 
interaction between EOL and Sitara or EOL and the pipeline bulletin boards 
(which we are still required to post through per the pipeline tariffs).  
Quite honestly, I have no idea how much activity these will generate since 
each product still has the potential for being "biddable" on the pipeline 
EBBs and there is not an easy solution around that.  Also, all completed 
transactions still must be posted on the EBBs and confirmed by the pipelines 
before the deal is actually completed.  This product does not make the 
release process any simpler; however, it does make it more visible by having 
bids and offers out on EOL, where people are more likely to be looking than 
the pipeline EBB.

The vision is to have the entire bidding and confirmation process through the 
EBBs automated, which would encourage a significant increase in trading 
activity for transportation, but there are several important infrastructure 
steps we must take first--you know, minor things like creating a 
transportation position screen in Sitara and getting the pipelines' EDI 
(Electronic Data Interchange) mechanisms in working form.  We are in testing 
with 9 pipelines as of today.

Also, as I'm sure you are aware, Julie Gomez is working with several 
pipelines to put their available IT (interruptible) space out on EOL (the 
last I heard this should happen for January business), and then I understand 
that she plans to work with EOL to allow third parties to put transportation 
bids and/or offers out on EOL in an "Altra-like" system--meaning ENA will not 
always be a party to those transactions.  

There are many changes occurring because of Order 637, but the pipelines are 
still going through their compliance filings and there are alot of complaints 
about those filings--which just means more time for implementation.

If you have any questions, please call me at x35514.

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20

Dave, I had a call from Bradford today and he has Buy's sign-off on 
recognizing U.S. $1.1MM credit exposure reduction as a result of our efforts 
on securing a 3rd charge on Beau's assets (additionally, the 3rd charge 
follows the assets with the Murphy credit upgrade). It is important to 
continue to send originators the right signals re credit mitigation and 
therefore I feel it is imperative that we grant the $1.1MM as origination to 
reward those efforts.

Please advise that you are in agreement, and we will book asap. 

Regards
Milnthorp

    Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm

    Location:  30C1

If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).

Thanks,

Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.  Trading income is 
slim pickings so far ..... we need some key deals of all sizes to close in 
the fourth quarter from your organizations.

Thanks
Delainey

Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on 
for next year.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Could you shed some light on this for me?  What are you looking for?  I'm 
afraid I might lose something as it gets translated from you to Wes to Paula 
to me back to Paula to Wes to you.  Perhaps we can discuss while you are here.

Tim,

Dave Delainey is looking for a target customer list, coverage metrics and 
goal and objectives for each of your teams:

 West Power Trading
 West Power Mid-Market/Services
 West Power Fundamentals/Structuring

Obviously his proposed breakout of your teams (noted above) is different from 
the way we planned them.  For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume 
Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?  

Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this 
information by the end of the week.  Do you think you can provide this 
information to me by Thursday?  Also, if you could let me know today about 
the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.

Thanks, Paula.

Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.  Just a bad day on the P/L 
side.  Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job.

Regards
Delainey

sounds like a great idea

Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure 
and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer 
services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as 
we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think 
we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into 
the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making 
into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or 
not - if so he needs to move to Houston.

 Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your 
plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and 
will give the green light with her shortly.

Regards
Delainey

Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.  When we get 
together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational 
re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support 
those businesses.

Regards
Delainey

Joe Kishkill@ENRON
12/06/2000 09:10 PM
Dave,

Short answer is "no".

Long answer:

Has had bad chemistry with some of the folks down there.  Maybe not all his 
fault...I do not have enough data.

He wants to push Brazil as important Wholesale market (ie pulp & paper, ags, 
metals).  I think this is sound and worth looking at.  But I think this 
should be looked at by those groups.  They set their priorities.  If they 
want to pay for him being down there, we can house him and coordinate etc.  
But I am going back to basics with energy and can not afford someone pushing 
something for the good of Enron on my P/L.  Probably narrow minded, but 
hopefully pragmatic on my part.

I used him last to interface with Networks.  He is pretty fast out of the 
chute (market analysis, who's who in country etc.), but then levels off 
before tangible bottom line contribution (during my observation period 
anyway.)

Probably more of a "think tank" guy and the "think tank" ain't in Brazil. 
(especially post reorg)

So is he worth keeping for Enron?  I say yes, in the right role.  (worked for 
Cargill previously with Risk Management experience)  Does he fit with Enron 
Americas in South America?  I say no and have told him as much.

Call if you need more.

Thanks,

Kish

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 

I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf. 

Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.

I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to 
manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal 
or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that 
done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.

Regards
Delainey

Bench strength is limited....  I have no one ( so far ).  Phillip would like 
to keep Steve South in trading.  I am plotting a move from the central 
desk.... 

How did your conversations go with the Denver Office  ?  

Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the 
meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have 
favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do 
we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?

Regards
Delainey

Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, 
assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented 
by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number 
will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be 
tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I 
need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate 
of outside legal costs by business unit.

Regards
Delainey
Dave:

I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) 
by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of 
total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate 
the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had 
used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we 
will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?

Just to inform you of my thoughts if they are applicable.

MFG
	
	

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.

Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible 
to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant 
contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room.  
Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely 
linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you 
want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.

Regards
Delainey
Barbara A Hueter@EES
10/18/2000 01:00 PM
On September 29th I sent you an email regarding requests for personal 
political contributions to Tennessee lawmakers.  If you or any others intend 
to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The 
election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final 
decisions on media spending.  Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying 
firm in Nashville.

The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law 
prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action 
committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. 
supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office 
materials, etc...).  Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a 
stringent campaign finance law. 

The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up 
to the business units with interests in Tennessee. 

If you need further information or would like to discuss this, you can reach 
me at 614-760-7472 or 614-306-4359 (cell).  
Barbara, we are getting tremendous pressure for contributions in these last 
days before the election.  As I have mentioned to you, Enron has been 
referred to specifically by one of the most powerful Senators.  Also, Lt. 
Gov. Wilder's campaign chairman called me in the latter part of last week, 
hoping for significant financial help for end-of-campaign TV buys.  Gif 
Thornton, Robert Gowan, and I are participating heavily; I cannot 
overemphasize the importance of Enron's participation.  The state "money 
crunch" which existed this past year likely will be worse when the General 
Assembly reconvenes (tax collections are coming in below estimates), and all 
existing tax exemptions will be at significant risk.  Please do what you can 
to get some Enron assistance for the candidates which we have discussed now.  
Thanks.  Bill

Rodney, if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process?

You should have made the call to kill it.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave, Marty,

In general moving the deal to just a Selkirk deal minimizes a lot of the 
concerns surrounding centralized decision making etc.  The plant manager is 
on board   
as is Doron Grossman.  As a result the sales part should be largely completed 
but the deal is far from closed.  I believe driving to closure with margin 
with GE in 2000 will be a challenge.  I haved attached some information 
regarding Marte's other questions and would be happy to discuss with the team.

  

David W Delainey
10/16/2000 09:42 AM
Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the 
Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer 
Marty's other questions?

Regards
Delainey
Hi David,
I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would 
change my mind.  If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be 
supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly 
significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney 
describes.  What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other 
undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: 

Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to "influence" the GE 
negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less 
desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements?
Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail?
Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change 
from current practice?  Do we know what that is and what the deadline for 
action for change is? 
Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the 
potential impact on the margin in the deal?  
Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the 
prospect that we can attach these pieces to that?

Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds 
like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000.  
HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to 
win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client 
would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking 
for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination 
team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go 
for it.

I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for.  If it was my opinion, that 
is above.  If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the 
probability go up, I'll be glad to help.  If it is some other, just let me 
know.  

I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney 
and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with 
margin in 2000.  I would love to participate and do what we can to make this 
work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to 
raising the probability of victory.  

Thanks

 

David W Delainey@ECT
10/13/2000 09:47 AM
Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney  

Guys, attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets 
for Q4 consistent with our discussions.  It is important that we hit our 
numbers in order for Enron to meet its targets for the year.

Regards
Delainey

Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your 
capabilities better than ours.  

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, 
part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric 
contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW 
of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all 
their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP 
controls in the nation.

The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him 
yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is 
a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like 
the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good 
lead into the health care segment.

Regards
Delainey 

Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most 
value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively 
develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the 
turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.

Dave, 

We will either: 

1. Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no 
replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our 
issues and is considering how they want to proceed.
2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the 
best case scenario.
3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan 
Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these 
parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or
4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now).

The time frame for resolving this is Q4.

Regards,

Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in 
nominal value):
  a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M
  b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M
  c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M
  d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M

All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.  
Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to 
flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all 
our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.

Regards
Delainey

Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board 
meetings and PRC's.

Lets set up this discussion with the following points:
 a) we are not exiting Argentina;
 b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business 
opportunity;
 c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate 
intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater 
productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision 
making and greater communication;
 d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer 
coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and
 e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao 
Paulo.

Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and 
origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources 
based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs 
wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong 
presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural 
issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that 
you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina 
- its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business 
model we are trying to move forward.

Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these 
ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and 
Orlando as part of this process.

Delainey

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to 
$105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace 
existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation ("ADC").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
"change-in-ownership" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH 
reflects the aggregate of these amounts.  The requirement with regard to 3) 
below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not "reasonably" merit 
replacement by Enron.

This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the 
BoD on 12/05/00.

The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:

1)  Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:  A. Ahlstrom provided a  
"comfort letter" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek 
project.  Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter 
may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.  The comfort letter 
requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the 
project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call 
related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:  
the project  is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage 
ratio in the pro forma model
the partnership maintains business interruption insurance
the project can subordinate $2MM in O&M incentive payments annually to meet 
its debt service targets

2)  Panther Creek -- Equity Support Agreements:  ADC, as well the other major 
partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther 
Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM  Equity 
support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project 
does not meet its debt service requirements.  We believe that these 
obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron 
obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.

In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for 
consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project 
lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, 
insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.

3)  Gilberton -- Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.

The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
of debt reamains outstanding)
pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x

Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.

From November 14-17, Houston will host Gastech 2000, one of the world's 
largest international natural gas, LNG, and LPG conferences.  The conference 
will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center and is expected to 
attract 3,000 delegates from around the world.

Enron has played a leading role in this conference for many years, and this 
year we will participate as a sponsor and prominent exhibitor.  Several Enron 
executives are speaking or moderating panels at the conference, including 
David Haug, Bill Gathmann, Doug Arnell and Dr Lay.  

On Wednesday, November 15, Ken Lay will serve as a keynote speaker at an 
Enron Sponsored luncheon at 12:30 P.M. and we would like to invite you to sit 
at the Enron table.  The dining room is located at the George R. Brown 
Convention Center, Ballroom Level Three.

Please RSVP via e-mail or call me at 5-6442, or Hal Means at 5-5384 if you 
have any questions.  Once we have the guest list finalized, we will provide 
you with details on the location of the entrance to the dining room, a pass, 
transportation/parking and other pertinent details.

Best regards

Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern 
Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain 
strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of 
this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory 
pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis 
markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward 
characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, 
there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA 
point of view.

The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, 
venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he 
believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million 
of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to 
participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the 
Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer 
Marty's other questions?

Regards
Delainey
Hi David,
I'll give you a response with the hope of seeing more information that would 
change my mind.  If you are asking for my opinon, it is difficult to be 
supportive of moving ahead on a transaction like this give the fairly 
significant obstacles (these are usually deals killers) that Rodney 
describes.  What I couldn't read into Rodney's write up were other 
undocumented factors that you might change the probability, like: 

Is there an Sr. executive champion that is willing to "influence" the GE 
negotiating team into getting a deal done, even if the terms are less 
desirable than what Rodney laid out as their requirements?
Are the willing to extned the term so that there isn't a capital tail?
Is there any real compelling motivation for this GE Plastics team to change 
from current practice?  Do we know what that is and what the deadline for 
action for change is? 
Could Rodney suggest alternatives to address the obstacles and show the 
potential impact on the margin in the deal?  
Is there some other component of this deal that is so compelling to the 
prospect that we can attach these pieces to that?

Realistically, based on what is written, the deal you are describing sounds 
like it would have a low probability to close, surely in 2000.  
HOWEVER< if there exenuating circumstances like you feel like we just need to 
win this at all costs, there are values not being calculated that the client 
would recognize, there are senior execs at GE Plastics behind this looking 
for a way to close this, or anything else that is convincing your origination 
team that they have a winner here....then, lets find out what that is and go 
for it.

I wasn't exactly sure what you were asking for.  If it was my opinion, that 
is above.  If it was to put more resource on it to try to make the 
probability go up, I'll be glad to help.  If it is some other, just let me 
know.  

I would suggest we just start with trying to get more information from Rodney 
and team regarding why they are convinced this can be contracted for with 
margin in 2000.  I would love to participate and do what we can to make this 
work out, as long as we all agree that there are reasonable approaches to 
raising the probability of victory.  

Thanks

Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been 
sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed 
some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter 
or so.

Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the 
deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to 
closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some 
value for Enron to take this deal including:
 a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;
 b) $3 to $5 M in value;
 c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the 
large industrial customers;
 and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in 
significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave,

The GE Plastics facility is located in Selkirk NY just south of Albany and 
produces polystyrene and polyphenyleneoxide.  The deal value is roughly $4-5 
million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.  

The obstacles to closure are:
- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted 
more
- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to 
pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,
- the savings include $1 million in O&M savings and it will be very difficult 
to get to closure with them letting us do the O&M

Deal Stats Are:

Electricity  230,000 mwh/yr  $12 million/yr
Steam  430,000 lbs/yr  $3   million/yr
Gas  470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yr
O&M     $3   million/yr
Total     $20 million/yr

10 year contract, total contract value $200 million.

Let me know if you need any further information.
Thanks,
Rodney  

Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial 
Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on 
the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal 
we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I 
believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other 
priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the 
value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than 
ENA.

Regards
Delainey
Dave,
On a more private note, what was the motivation for this note, especially 
copying Frevert and Pai?  
Are we (EES) being uncooerative and your purpose was to raise visibility?  
Can you help me with what your thinking is what you would view as a desirable 
outcome?  

Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines?

Regards
Delainey

Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I

Dave,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director to represent Analysts at the final 
2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and additions to the Associate and Analyst 
Programs, we have an additional slot for the Analyst PRC that we would like 
to fill with an ENA participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout 
the business units equitable.  I understand from Charlene that you have asked 
Janet Dietrich to nominate the PRC Rep.

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for ENA representation to me by this date or contact me to discuss.

Also, I know that there have been discussions between Terry Bosien, David 
Oxley, Andrea Yowman and others to schedule ENA's pre-rating meeting prior to 
the final A/A PRC which has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We 
must have the pre-ratings loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and 
hope they can be final by November 30th.  These results are imperative to a 
successful cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates 
set for the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and 
Analyst piece of ENA's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise 
when the ENA pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. 
America.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 

I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf. 

Tim, it is all yours please communicate ASAP to Jana Jovanni in the A&A 
program.

Regards
Delainey

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Guys, what is this!!!!

No - I think that Ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in 
a price reduction. I vote not to do the deal otherwise.

Regards
Delainey  

The Approval Amount for the Inga DASH has been revised from $98 million to 
$105.25 million to accomodate the potential requirement of having to replace 
existing credit support facilities provided by the seller, A. Ahlstrom, or 
the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation ("ADC").  Although not explicit, 
this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain 
"change-in-ownership" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete 
Enron's acquisition of ADC.  As we believe that the liklihood of this 
requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH 
reflects the aggregate of these amounts.  The requirement with regard to 3) 
below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not "reasonably" merit 
replacement by Enron.

This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the 
BoD on 12/05/00.

The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:

1)  Panther Creek -- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:  A. Ahlstrom provided a  
"comfort letter" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek 
project.  Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter 
may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.  The comfort letter 
requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the 
project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.

Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call 
related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:  
the project  is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage 
ratio in the pro forma model
the partnership maintains business interruption insurance
the project can subordinate $2MM in O&M incentive payments annually to meet 
its debt service targets

2)  Panther Creek -- Equity Support Agreements:  ADC, as well the other major 
partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther 
Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM  Equity 
support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project 
does not meet its debt service requirements.  We believe that these 
obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron 
obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.

In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for 
consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project 
lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, 
insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.

3)  Gilberton -- Capital Support Agreement:  Orion Power Company (a 
subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity 
support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot 
be met.  We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these 
obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or 
Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.

The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this 
credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:
the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 2002
the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM 
of debt reamains outstanding)
pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15x

Given there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC 
does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.  To the 
extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for 
these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.

Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.

10/09/2000 04:27 PM
Dave, I agree with your perspective on this.  Building another theoretical 
model in the Basic situation seems naive to me.  This company is and has been 
in a financial death spiral.  For months, all involved on the ENA side have 
been focused on a probability that the Basic situation would result in a 
writeoff of a very significant piece of the Merlin debt and nothing for the 
equity.  The deal we are working on is at the high end of the projections 
reviewed with the rating agencies on recovery for the Merlin debt and 
actually gets us at least some chance of recovery on our equity.

I do not agree that no effort has been made to market the company.  As you 
recall, we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would 
take out the debt.  Despite many attempts to structure a successful offering 
(and a series of difficult concessions by Enron), the IB finally pulled it.  
The S-1, by the way, was about the ugliest I have ever seen.

We carefully evaluated seeking an industry purchaser.  Our conclusion was 
that this risked losing significant value, would require a good deal of time, 
and had virtually no likelihood of equalling the recovery we have would 
achieve if we can do the deal on the table.   This evaluation was reinforced 
with the contacts we have had with industry players.

In any liquidation there is always the possibility that another path could 
possibility capture more value.  In this case especially, I think we have a 
very good idea of reality and are making an uniformed decision to recommend a 
better-than-exected exit.  This is not a firesale.

We will continue to work constructively with RAC in a non-confrontational 
mode on Basic.  Be assured, however, that if I feel there is a real risk of 
process getting in the way of achieving our objectives, I will raise a red 
flag.  Dick.

David W Delainey@ECT
09/29/2000 11:34 AM
Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the 
current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a 
clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.

It is too easy to state the obvious.

Regards
Delainey
In my opion this DASH did exactly what it was supposed to do - prompt a 
dialog on whether we are getting an adequate price for this asset. My 
understanding is that no model was built to value an alternative nor was 
there any effort to market the company. If we want to "take the money and 
run" (whhich in this case is probably the right decision) fine, but we should 
know what we are leaving behind, especially given the current commodity price 
environment.  Rick

Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let 
this go through. Sorry.

10/09/2000 12:16 PM
Dave,

Wanted to give you a heads up...

We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO.  
This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft 
engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air 
permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the 
entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach 
given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  

The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  
with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a 
need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 
through Jan 31.

We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient 
conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if 
there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, 
fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated 
and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a 
definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with 
Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two 
LM6000's for this project.

I am available to talk about it at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris
Christopher F Calger
10/08/2000 05:13 PM
Chip,

PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.

In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
equipment through West LB ASAP:

6 stacks  $1,188,000
3 Control Modules $375,000
1 CEMS  $675,000
4 230kv Breakers $340,000
Total:   $2,578,000

The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
minimal as follows:

Now through November 1:    $257,800
Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)

Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:

EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000

Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount 
might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering 
costs.  That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more 
complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec 
Committe meeting in November.

How does this sound to you?

Regards,

Chris

Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with 
some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant

Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do 
give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave 
them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying 
it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we 
currently have it.  Thanks.

Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot 
List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making 
our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the 
year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination 
organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong 
performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum 
into the year-end PRC. 

I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and 
specifics on the deals.

Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to 
reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups 
and managers have very low participation rates.

I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% 
participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the 
"happy" folks.

"The Pulse" is the new name for the employee survey -- formerly known as 
Excellence Through Communication.  It is scheduled to rollout on Monday, 
October 16.  In an effort to boost participation, I would like to ask for 
your assistance in spreading the word to your direct reports at your staff 
meeting.  They should, in turn, encourage their direct reports to 
participate.  Last year, ENA's participation rate was approximately 50% and 
our goal for this year is 60%.

The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete and can be 
done electronically.  The topics covered are:

 1) What are the obstacles to performance and effectiveness?
 2) What things hinder job satisfaction and fulfillment?
 3) What more can be done to make Enron the best place to work?

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at ext. 3-9053.

Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on 
this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have 
little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or 
collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group 
to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this 
increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.

I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our 
settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of 
communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I 
have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the 
larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm 
pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have 
suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both 
TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are 
going.  

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the 
execution was probable.

By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?

Regards
Delainey

Put a bid into SOCO's shareholders for the transmission assets only.  Since 
the market is valuing Genco assets at a much higher multiple, a bid at book 
value for the transco would be very intriguing to the existing shareholder 
base.

Given a high probability of supply shortage in Florida over the next 2-4 
years, the transmission gateway to Florida is extremely valuable, 
particularly if expansions are done off the existing system.

In addition, it would give Enron tremendous regulatory leverage with the 
pending Entergy/FPL (SOCO connects systems), and the entire SE market, 
including TVA.

I know it's a longshot, but we will have to do something radical to bust open 
the SE market into a free functioning commodity market.  The SE is 
essentially untapped from a power trading standpoint right now, and the 
market is nearly 200,000 MW if you include Florida.

Rick which meeting are you refering to?

Gentelmen,

Following is an email detailing requests for personal contributions to 
legislators who have been instrumental to Enron regarding our power plants in 
Tennessee.  I produced this list based on recommendations from our lobbying 
firm, Stokes Bartholomew, in Nashville.

In 1999, Stokes Bartholomew, working with Jordan Mintz in Enron's tax 
department, convinced the state legislature to pass legislation clarifying 
that Enron's power plants would be exempt from the gross receipts tax.  Had 
we not succeeded in the effort, we would have had to pay gross receipts taxes 
of approximately $1.5 million per year.  

In 2000, Tennessee is one of the only states in the union that has been 
running a deficit in the general revenue fund.  Rather than going home for 
the summer, the legislature stayed in session and debated among themselves 
and with the Governor on how to solve the revenue shortfall issue.  
Eventually, they adopted unreasonably  optimistic revenue projections to 
produce a balanced budget (on paper).   This has not solved the problem 
because the state is already $100 million below revenue projections in the 
first quarter of the fiscal year.  The legislature will look for a long term 
solution when it returns in January.  Stokes Bartholomew informs me that all 
sources of revenue will be considered - this means our exemption from the 
gross receipts tax could possibly be repealed.  At this time, no one is 
singling this exemption out, but Stokes Bartholomew is cautious and is 
monitoring the issue closely.

Numerous legislators supported the gross receipts legislation for Enron.  If 
our gross receipts tax exemption is threatened next legislative session, we 
would have to return to these same legislators (if they are reelected) for 
support.  As long as Enron pays taxes in Tennessee, it behooves us to take an 
active interest in supporting those legislators who will defend our interests 
in the capitol.

Since you are the key contacts at Enron for Tennessee, I ask you to assess 
this matter and decide whether ongoing legislative support is important to 
Enron's interests in TN and make contributions accordingly.

I have recommended $9,500 in contributions.  While this seems like a large 
amount, it is miniscule in comparison to the taxes we are not paying.  
Moreover, it will go a long way to helping us protect our interests against 
those who would fight to have "big corporations", particularly out-of-state 
corporations, get stuck with additional tax burdens to solve the state's 
fiscal woes.

You are probably asking why we are not using Enron PAC funds or coroporate 
funds to make these donations.  Tennessee law prohibits us from using 
corporate funds and limits the use of PAC funds to those PACs that do not 
receive any source of support from the corporation.  Because Enron Corp. pays 
the expenses for the Enron PAC, we are not permitted to contribute Enron PAC 
funds to candidates in Tennessee.  This is one of the most onerous political 
contribution laws in the country.

If you have any questions I can be reached for the next week at 
614.306.4359.  Or you can leave a message for me at 614.760.7472.

Per our phone conversation, following is a list of key legislative leaders 
deserving of Enron's support.  This list has been developed by our 
counsel/legislative agents in Nashville: Bill Bruce, Gif Thornton and Robert 
Gowan.

Please feel free to call me to discuss further.  You can reach me on my cell 
phone this afternoon and all day tomorrow.  I will be in the office on Monday.

Lieutenant Governor: Senator John Wilder (Democrat)
$2,500
Represents Brownsville in the Senate.
Sponsor of 1999 gross receipts tax exemption legislation for Brownsville.
Has a serious opponent this November.
The Senate elects the Lieutenant Governor who also serves as the head of the 
Senate.  It is in Enron's best interst that John Wilder win the election and 
be re-elected Lieutenant Governor. 

Rep. Jimmy Naifey
$1,000
Speaker of the House
Represents Brownsvile.

Senate Candidate Larry Trail (Democrat)
$2,000
John Wilder's personal mission, besides his own election, is to get Larry 
elected to the Senate (it is an open seat that is being vacated by a 
Democrat).
If the Democrats lose this seat there is a very good chance that Senator 
Wilder will not be re-elected Lieutenant Governor because the Democrats will 
have lost the majority in the Senate.

Rep. Matt Kisber (Democrat)
$1,500
Represents the Jackson area.
Very pro-business Democrat.
Is in a very tough race because the district was redrawn and it now majority 
Republican.
Matt is the chair of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee - which 
hears all gross receipts tax matters.
Was very helpful to Enron on the gross receipts legislation.

Senator Jerry Cooper
$1,000
Chair of the Senate Commerce Committee
His committee hears all legislation relating to energy and power plants.

Rep. Shelby Rinehart
$500
Chair of Commerce Committe (all energy and power plant issues) and powerful 
member of the House Finance and Ways and Means Committee.
He is extremely powerful.  Bill, Gif and Robert have a very good relationship 
and rely on him for assistance for their clients regularly.

I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just 
think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with 
families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the

al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.

Please forward this to Dave and John.  My e-mail is not working for them.

Thanks.

What do you think of a hostile bid for SOCO's transmission assets (Georgia 
Power, Gulf Power, Alabama Power, Savannah Electric, & Mississippi Power & 
Light), and a simultaneously create an ISO/RTO that is auctioned to the 
market.  This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE 
significantly.

I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to 
provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so 
our capital at risk would be minimal.  Additionally, we would cut a deal with 
FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate 
transmission owner would live with the market design.

What are your thoughts.

Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas 
and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to 
increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and 
generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and 
origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the 
market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have 
to wait and see.

Thanks

I enjoyed your presentation this morning.  You mentioned that one of your 
current tasks is "pushing the legacy origination/structuring model to the 
next step".  What do you mean by this?  Do you envision using the internet or 
other technology to enhance the current origination structure?

Chris, you are officially the king today!  With the PSCo deal this 
effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV.

Dave,

The CA ISO Board met today and approved a plan to provide capacity subsidies 
to up to 2,000 MW of new supply.  There was 71 proposals from 24 companies.  
We offered 7 proposals.  Their decision criteria is ridiculous and subject to 
change, but it looks like we won the following:

1 LM6000 - 45MW - Pleasonton - $6.9MM per year for three years -  $153/kwyear

1 LM6000 - 45MW - LODI - $6.9MM per year for three years - $153/kwyear

4 FT4's - 96MW - Southern/Palo Alto - $13.2MM per year for three years - 
$137/kwyear

Las Vegas Cogen / EPMI 225MW Palo Verde Sale $10MM per year for three years - 
$44/kwyear

In the first three deals, we have the full rights to the energy; capacity 
payments are for availability.  These payments, combined with reasonable toll 
values, terminal value and EPC costs, make the projects economic (DASH 
forthcoming).

The last deal is a bit strange and non-conforming but the ISO likes it 
because it is priced very low.  Basically, we agree to deliver power to the 
ISO at the California border next summer priced at PX Index plus $20/MWh.  CA 
ISO takes power, sells into PX and receives Index.  This is cheaper than what 
they are paying for new capacity in state.  The $20 premium is simply the 
basis between Palo and SP15.  In 2002 and 2003, LVCogen commits to sell 500 
hours to CA ISO and receive PX for its energy.  In 02 and 03, the Palo/SP 
spread collapses so an asset buyer sees this $20MM as gravy.

Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted.  Parquet, Mcdonald and Laird 
are doing a great job.

Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set?

Dear David,

My name is David Ronkainen and I have been an Enron employee for about one 
year.  I joined 
Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for 
me.  I met with Dave Ramm 
to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in 
working for Enron.  
I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with 
Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.  I still 
have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the 
most commonly used power 
supply of the not so distant future.  I went to a seminar on distributed 
power in Washington D.C. last 
week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community  
thought about fuel cells 
and microturbines.  I learned a lot.

Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.  My 
job is interesting, but I have 
a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve 
DP.  Do you have a job opportunity
for a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and 
microturbines?  If there is an opportunity
I would like to talk with you about it.

I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical 
Engineering.  I have worked 
in manufacturing and the oil field service business.  I have worked at the 
corporate level in both businesses.
I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business 
should be run.  I also understand the 
opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new 
industries and technologies.  I  know
that I can help Enron in this area.

If you would like my resume please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

David Ronkainen

Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail 
opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail

Energy opportunity:  Have you thought about supplying electricity to

submitted to eMeet.

Sounds reasonable.

Charlene, the 2nd is ok. Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able

Hi Dave,
Thanks for agreeing to participate in Super Saturday.  Unfortunately, I gave 
you the wrong date.  I think I told you December 9th and it should have been 
December 2nd.  I hope that is still OK.  We are still looking for someone to 
do the first one which is October 28th.  I think it would be great if someone 
at your level could start it off to send a message.  However, I won't get 
greedy  I will take what I can get (smile). Just let me know.

With respect to the straw man, I have worked on it but it is not complete.  
Celeste was scheduled to be here this week but has been put on bed rest by 
her doctor and has had to leave a week early.  I am trying to work with her 
recruiters who are in the middle of campus presentations, etc.  I will finish 
working on it this weekend and we can meet on Tuesday.  I will call Kay and 
get on your schedule.   I will try to get you a draft prior to our meeting 
(by Monday) so you can review it before hand.
Thanks Charlene

Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play 
given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the 
customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?  
Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated 
structure in the RFP?

Is this a play that you would support? 

On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso 
note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to 
quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.

How is it going otherwise?

Regards
Delainey
	
	

David,

Devils Tower is a deepwater project on Mississippi Canyon block 773.  
Dominion is the operator and has a 60% working interest in the project.  
Mariner Energy (20%) and Pioneer Resources (20%) are the remaining working 
interest owners.

During the first week of September, Production Offshore, managed by Tom 
Byargeon, received an RFP and an information packet to submit a proposal for 
the development of a floating production system and export pipelines.

Since the Devils Towers project exists in a prolific active deepwater reserve 
area and this area has little developed infrastructure, this project is 
strategic and creates a very relevant and marketable infrastructure 
position.  For example, Exxon has indicated their interest in tying back 
their production from Crazy Horse (south of Devils Tower) to this platform.  
In addition, the production from this platform could be funneled into Exxon's 
export pipelines on the shelf.

This project will financed by a structure where Enron forms a joint venture 
(JV) with an independent third party.   The joint venture partners capitalize 
the JV with a nominal amount of funds.  The JV leases capacity on the 
platform and export pipelines from a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The SPV 
uses the lease agreement to obtain a loan from financial institutions.  In 
turn, the SPV uses equity capital (from a tax based investor) and the loan 
proceeds to purchase or develop the deepwater assets.

The JV receives cash flows from leasing the production capacity from the 
Devils Tower deepwater assets.  This capacity on the deepwater assets will be 
sold for five to seven years under a production handling agreement (PHA).  
Final point, the JV receives a financial instrument (most likely a note 
receivable)  equal to their portion of the net proceeds from the PHA.

Enron books income on the monetization of this financial instrument via a 
FASB sell down (most likely, selling a note receivable to a bank for cash).  
In addition, because the lease capacity for the deepwater assets will be sold 
for only five-seven years and these assets will have a minimum working life 
for twenty, there exists potential upside for Enron.  For example, cash flows 
from incremental PHAs (ie., through tiebacks to Devils Tower deepwater 
assets) can be monetized via the FASB 125 sell down.

The financial structure was designed to minimize capital outlays and 
financial risk.  Also, Joe Deffner and Roger Ondreko are very familar with 
the structure and assisted in its design.

The RFP is due October 2nd.   There will a meeting tommorrow from 1-3 pm to 
discuss the status of the proposal in EB 3583. Please feel free to attend.

Regards, 

Jean

Congratulations on the Fuel Cell venture.  I have been trying to get Enron 
interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the 
right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology 
and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your 
organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in 
your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person?

Best regards,

Marion Cole

Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical 
feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in 
Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a 
stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not 
advocating this play just passing on the message.

Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
Project e-trans (the RTO software).

The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of

Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the 
Barges?

Regards
Delainey
Brian Redmond
09/29/2000 04:56 PM
Dave:

Status of the 6Bs:  Enron Nigeria has sent us $7.1MM for the two turbines.  
We have an agreed turbine purchase contract that we have executed and that 
Enron Nigeria are supposed to execute today.  Per our discussion, Wes C.  
suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1 
turbine purchase revenue to Q4.

Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.  Currently, we 
are:  

1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the 
barges by themselves
2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable 
PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.

The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:

IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy,
   AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability 
risk (discussions ongoing)
   AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for 
replacement capacity charged by the desk.
   AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvable

OR,

IF: We can find an "as-is, where-is" buyer for the Barges with/without the 
PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG)

THEN: 
 ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in 
Brooklyn) 

ELSE: 
 We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.    

 1. LIPA:  We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason 
to stop working on the deal.

2. BargeCo:  The barges will have a lower performance than what was 
originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be 
required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this 
additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to 
implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so 
that we are sure this transaction is completed.

Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the 
current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a 
clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.

It is too easy to state the obvious.

Regards
Delainey
In my opion this DASH did exactly what it was supposed to do - prompt a 
dialog on whether we are getting an adequate price for this asset. My 
understanding is that no model was built to value an alternative nor was 
there any effort to market the company. If we want to "take the money and 
run" (whhich in this case is probably the right decision) fine, but we should 
know what we are leaving behind, especially given the current commodity price 
environment.  Rick

David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more 
art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision 
rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, 
Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good 
trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of 
the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return 
assets (ROCE >25%).

This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that 
comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from 
this group in each case.

Regards
Delainey
David Gorte
09/29/2000 09:48 AM
Dave,

Your comments on the Basic DASH are well-taken.  We will clarify what RAC 
views as the current valuation of Basic as well as RAC's recommendation with 
respect to this divestiture and modify the DASH as quickly as possible.

Your comments prompted a question with regard to ENA's divestiture strategy.  
Is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 
30% (i.e., future divestiture proceeds are 70% of the expected terminal value 
at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market 
conditions) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher 
NPV at the RAC capital price than the proposed sale proceeds, ENA would elect 
to retain the asset?  Or should a higher than "market" capital price be 
assigned by RAC to these assets earmarked for divestiture?

Regards,

Dave

understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I 
may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) 
no more 6B's or barges.

Regards
Delainey

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Dave and John

David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH.  
Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the 
reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant 
recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and 
infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given 
the possible recovery of this sector?  

The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy 
prices.

Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?

Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want 
to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring. 

Regards
Delainey

Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to 
see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of 
FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time 
>$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more 
mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage 
investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have 
had such a discussion.

Regards
Delainey

Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I 
understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing 
dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I 
will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow 
up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power 
business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the 
effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all 
believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and 
rewarded.

Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) 
customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions 
and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.

I look forward to sitting down to discuss.

Regards
Delainey
Dave:

I spoke with Ed Baughman about the reports he is generating to measure Middle 
Market Group "coverage" in the East.  I also met with Greg Wolfe. and Tim B. 
to get their feedback as to how the East Desk Middle Market Reports reports 
should be used/modified for the West.  As a result of these discussions, 
along with discussions with others in the Middle Market Group, effective 
October 1, we will begin to more systematically measure certain behaviors, 
such as customer telephone calls, in addition to origination.  By focusing on 
behaviors, and not simply results, our hope is to expand the pool of 
customers and information and improve our marketing effort.  I will be 
working with Ed to try to standarize the approach within EPMI.

It is my understanding that you will be in Portland for a QBR toward the end 
of October.  I look forward to reviewing our plans for coverage metrics and 
our first results with you then.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this approach prior to your visit.  

Thanks!

Chris

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Regards
Delainey
	
	

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be 
interested in the attached spreadsheet listing some of these key deals done 
this year.  

Please let me know if you want further details on the transactions 
(503/464-3822).

Thanks!

Chris

Could you please send an e-mail to Delainey, Lavorato, and Calger summarizing 
our long term deals done this year.  It should be pretty short with just the 
facts.  The deals I can think of are Kaiser, Roseville, Santa Clara, Redding, 
and Merced.  They didn't ask for it, but I think it would be nice to do a 
quick, short, sweet piece of Portland Orig/Middle Market PR.  Let me know 
your thoughts.

John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with 
all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the 
key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.

I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% 
of reviews done.  Do you agree.
	
	

Attached, for your information is a matrix reflecting the status of completed 
reviews from the mid-year 2000 process.  This is broken down by ENA 
organization units, as they were structured at mid-year, prior to the 
creation of EGM and EIM.

I will provide you with a weekly update on the status.

Please call me at X36628 should you have any questions.

ok with me

Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow.

Delainey

John, I think you may want to be part of this.

Brian Redmond has requested a meeting to discuss Systems Outsourcing on 
Friday, Oct., 6, in Dave Delainey's office, EB3314 @ 2:00 PM with Dave 
Delainey, Greg Whalley, Philipe Bibi and Jean Mrha.  If this time does not 
work for you, please call Lillian Carroll @ 37271.  Thank you. 

Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I 
think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going 
concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses 
that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the 
cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than 
the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often 
clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly 
effectively.

Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of 
time on this.

Regards
Delainey

Thanks

Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability 
to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to 
confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie 
putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the 
short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of 
lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.

These guys add no value and they are killing me!

Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position 
in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA 
could create significant value from a project that we have very little 
invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone 
and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, 
as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will 
argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to 
maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant 
dollars or taking significant risks.

Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the 
wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a 
little longer than expected to get people together but we are making 
progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks 
would like to go if they had their druthers.

It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.

Regards
Delainey

Ok - you got the ball.

Regards
Delainey

Thanks Dave.   This 12 MW output increase is at 90 degrees and we could 
easily demonstrate this increased output with a capacity test for any 
potential buyer.  Therefore, the increased sales value is real.

Mitch, Mike and myself will sort this out to maximize value for Enron (and 
ENA).

Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of 
cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this?

Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are 
giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a 
contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership.  
Lets discuss ASAP.

Regards
Delainey

At Dave Duran's request I have attached for your information two files 
containing a term sheet from El Paso reflecting the final terms as negotiated 
and a spreadsheet analysis of the valuation of that offer ($206.6mm).  The 
offer analysis uses a discount rate on the El Paso Deferred and Scheduled 
Payments of 8.25%.  This rate is the middle of the range of a recent quote 
from Treasury/RAC as to the expected rate at which we will be able to 
monetize this payment stream.  The Contingent Payments are in the form of a 
residual preferred partnership interest that we will retain and are 
discounted at the current project rate with a probability adjustment.  The 
residual partnership interest should allow us to fair value these contingent 
payments (as we are currently doing on the existing contingent payments) and 
should also be beneficial to the tax structure of the transaction.

good job - keep them coming!

Delainey

Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall.

Thanks
Randall Curry@ENRON
09/25/2000 06:40 PM
Dave,

Thanks for following through with the contact.  As we discussed, the 
discussions we had with Calpine were at a local level and very preliminary, 
with Bridgeline indicating to Calpine that we are always open to looking at 
ways that will enhance shareholder value.  I agree with you that at this time 
it has a low probability of evolving into anything.  

On a separate note, I would like to take you up on your offer of your time 
and resources.  I know that Bridgeline is a very small component of the 
things that are on your radar screen, but if it is not too much of an 
imposition, I would like to have a one on one discussion with you concerning 
a few of the issues we discussed at the management committee mtg.

I want to make sure that I am crystal clear on the perspectives and desires 
of both parents.  Coming from Texaco, I feel like I have a good feel for 
Texaco's short and long term expectations for the partnership, however I 
would like to dig a little deeper with you on a few of the issues we 
discussed at the management committee mtg, and a couple of your points in 
your follow up email to me.

The afternoon or evening would work best for me, and I would be happy to pick 
up the tab for dinner one night if that fits with your schedule.  The balance 
of this week is kind of tight, however, the week of September 2nd and 9th are 
fairly open with the exception of Tuesday night the 3rd.

Thanks for your help, look forward to talking to you soon. 

Randy

Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential 
interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real 
knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level 
and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more 
detail over the next week.

Regards
Delainey

Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up 
with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on 
Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so 
that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also 
suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.  
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as 
Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties 
settlement offer.

I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest 
convenience.

Regards
Dave Delainey

Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy.

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request 
to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes 
examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. 

EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier 
this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR 
filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.
** High Priority **

Christi -

Attached is the final filing in word.  I also sent you a hard copy on Friday.

 - aep.doc

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Regards
Delainey

Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the 
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.  
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in 
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower 
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value 
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue 
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time 
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that 
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really 
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of 
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed 
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost 
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital 
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee 
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized 
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and 
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.

Regards
Delainey

Given the probable sale of these 2 facilities, I would like clarification on 
the LD proceeds from Westinghouse.  See questions/points below.

1)  Izzo has claimed that you (Delainey) has agreed to pay EE&CC for 
construction services in the form of Westinghouse LD payments.  Is this 
correct?
2)  I am concerned that EE&CC will settle for cash payment from Westihnghouse 
(Heat Rate & Schedule penalties) rather than increased output.
3)  Given a sale at $450/kW, increased output is worth $5 million vs. the 
$1-2 million we would collect for schedule and Heat Rate LD's.
4)  My recommendation is to trade the HR and schedule shortfall for increased 
output at Gleason to maximize total Enron profitability.

From ENA's perspective we should collect the schedule penalty at Wheatland 
only and insist on the 12 MW additional output at Gleason.  This combination 
provides the best value to Enron.

If Izzo's form of payment for the construction jobs is Westinghouse LD's, 
then he will be motivated to recieve cash payment.  Please provide me the 
necessary feedback to ensure that we do the right thing for Enron.

Thanks Dave.

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks

Dave,

I spoke with Frank Gardner, the acting President of the mine.  The mine has 
shut down due to high power prices and they are evaluating reopening it later 
this year.  John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very 
well (Frank acknowledged that).  EPMI has served this load in the past and 
made numerous proposals to them during the past year.  Montana rejected 
these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below 
the current forward market price.  John has also proposed various 
cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.  John will discuss 
their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.  I do not 
think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long 
and the industrials' credit is marginal.  We will keep you posted if anything 
materializes. 

Regards,

Chris

Chris, I called MRI but Frank was too busy to take the call so I left my name

so you'll know, attached is a sample Term Sheet that I have previously showed 
MRI.  Note the prices that were "too high" at the time.    John

Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved.  
It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.

The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include:
 a) improving the financial performance of the entity;
 b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure 
matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in 
every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only 
benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis;
 c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the 
"smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your 
people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover 
advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors 
(ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and 
aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and
 d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.

My time and resources are at your disposal.

Dave -

FYI.  

While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are 
those that are pushing "stand-alone" legislation before Congress.  Attached 
is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA 
reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American.

Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation.  
Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and 
wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.  This may incent 
the holdouts to agree to our needs.

If you need any additional information, please let me know.

Thanks,

David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign 
off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or 
Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence 
point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.

Regards
Delainey

Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will 
better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests 
that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in 
the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in 
the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would 
suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:

 It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an 
effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   
investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is 
important for the following reasons:
  a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium 
term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity 
and capital transactions in the wholesale group;
  b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and
  c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral 
benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.

ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor 
and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.

Delainey

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Delainey

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

Chas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who heads
up our west power desk.  Tim can be reached at 503-464-3820 (Portland).

Dear Mr. Bibi,

After giving more thought to our initial conversation, I have attached a
short document comparing Blacklight's (BLP) technology to fuel cell
technology.  BLP is developing a technology for the distributed electric
market.  We have prototypes under development, and the costs for our
technology compare favorably to the existing market.  The brochure will
elaborate on the advantages of our technology.

As we discussed, BLP is an R&D firm contacting companies that might have
complementary assets which would expedite the commercialization of our
technology.  As a result of our first discussion, I understand that Enron
might not be interested in new generation technology.  I wanted to provide
you with additional information on BLP.  If Enron's strategies change,
please contact me.  If you know other companies interested in investing or
joint developing a new generation technology, please let me know.  Thank you
for taking the time to review our materials.

Best Regards,

William Good

Hello everyone!

Joe Sutton would like to have a meeting to discuss the above subject on 
Monday, September 18 at 10:00 am - Houston time.  If you plan to be in 
Houston at this time, please meet in Jeff's office.  A telecon number will be 
arranged and we will furnish this number to you tomorrow.

Due to Jeff's very busy September calendar - this is the only slot we could 
get.

Thanks for your support!

Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this 
basis.  I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for 
the 2000's all in.

Dick,

I have done some more research on the cost versus Peaker Fee issue.  The 
numbers from ENA's side lay out as follows:

ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs  $4,449,000
ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete $   720,000
Reduction in Variable Overheads  $3,000,000
IDC on ENA Overpayments   $   200,000
Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable  $   180,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Gleason   $1,800,000
Westinghouse L.D.'s- Wheatland  $   500,000
Preliminary Total Reduction
in Project Costs                  $10,849,000

ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs:  ENA paid according to pre-determined cash 
curves every month.  NEPCO's actual costs appear to be coming in about $4.5 
MM less per the audit results that we both reviewed last Friday.

ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete:  When we met last Friday, there were 
$1,459,000 of Open P.O.'s and other items that NEPCO still needed to 
investigate and closeout, you have a copy of the detailed schedule prepared 
by Amy Spoede.  Of the $1,459,000, there was $720,000 showing as still owing 
to ABB for Circuit Breakers at Wilton Center.  ABB has informed ENA that they 
have been payed in full for quite some time, thus I believe that this 
$720,000 is an accounting phantom that NEPCO needs to clear up.

Reduction in Variable Overheads:  The $3,000,000 in variable overhead 
reduction is the number that you offered to cut this cost in our meeting last 
Friday.

IDC on ENA Overpayments:  As part of our agreement with EE&CC/NEPCO, ENA 
agreed to pay 2000 peaker construction costs based upon cash curves versus 
actual invoices.  The cash curves consistently overestimated NEPCO's actual 
disbursements, even after quarterly audits and true-ups.  NEPCO currently 
owes ENA over $200,000 in IDC at the cost of capital charged by Enron Corp.

Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable:  Some EE&CC/NEPCO personnel coded time 
against variable overheads that should have been charged against the 
pre-agreed fixed overheads. 

Westinghouse L.D.'s:  ENA paid Westinghouse directly for the turbines.  ENA 
has held back $3.5 MM of retainage pending resolution of L.D.'s.  
EE&CC's/ENA's position is that Westinghouse owes $2.3 MM of L.D.'s ($1.8 MM @ 
Gleason, $0.5MM @ Wheatland).  The aforementioned L.D.'s are for delivery and 
schedule delays at Gleason and Wheatland.  There is an additional $1.0-1.6 MM 
of performance L.D.'s for missing heat rate guarantees at Gleason.  ENA will 
negotiate the performance L.D. settlement directly with Westinghouse because 
the cure will be getting additional MW's in trade against the L.D.'s.  
Otherwise, Westinghouse can cure by minor unit modifications and re-test 
versus paying cash L.D.'s.  However, the Delivery and Schedule L.D.'s will 
still be negotiated by EE&CC.

Peaker Fee Settlement:  Based on our last meeting and additional research, I 
suggest the following path to quickly resolve the Peaker fee amount and 
payment.  If EE&CC will take over the risk/reward of the Delivery & Schedule 
L.D. issue with Westinghouse, then ENA will recharacterize the amounts 
detailed above as Peaker fee payment.  If EE&CC is successful in keeping all 
the Schedule L.D.'s from Westinghouse, then it would have a $10.85 MM fee 
versus $9.2 MM.  EE&CC only needs to keep $650,000 of the $2.3 MM of 
Westinghouse Schedule L.D.'s to have a $9.2 MM fee.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here.

Mike J Miller

Hey guys, just a few housekeeping notes:

1.)  Employee Expenses:  We really need to try and trim the expenses where 
and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for 
air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and 
our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we 
really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in 
booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else 
if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle 
your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow 
you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 

2.)  Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be 
approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.  
Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to 
approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval.

3.)  All employee reviews should be completed by now for 
Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be 
written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes 
for filing.  Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this 
Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and 
both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC 
as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback 
over the next week.

4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is 
extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything 
possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as 
follows:

Ozzie Pagan:  TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/Tenaska
Jeff Ader:          NSTAR, CRRA,  Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEG
Bruce Sukaly:  AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, 
EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AEC
Gil Muhl:            PSEG, NJN
Laura Luce:      Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB deals
Ben Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site 
Bank, Coal Plant development
Ed and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closure

We're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. 
The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very 
well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to 
closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and  I'll 
personally handle them.
There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. 
Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, 
VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and 
many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.  

5.)  Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate.

Thanks!  

 

Jeff Ader is looking for a reserved parking spot.  He is presently parking on 
the Blue level and would like to have a reserved spot due to his frequent 
traveling and customer appointments that warrant his leaving the building, 
thus loosing his parking space. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Kay   3-0643

David:

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed "New Roles" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column "Calme" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Shawn

Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not 
execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to 
operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute 
the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential 
buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have 
been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.

All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities 
(including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) 
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.

Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack

Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.

I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to 
ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear 
"title" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be 
interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX 
and increase our operating hours.

I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the 
next level.

Please stay in contact.

Regards
Delainey
Dave,

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the issues and opportunities facing
our companies. I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seeking
business advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. I
apologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you were
now responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!!!

Here is what I came away with:

Litigation
GE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press release
unacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response to
GE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press release
altogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legal
options.

Private Placement
The book has been released to Enron & Calpine. I understand your position
concerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I am
very open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me about
it after the meeting and we will discuss it next week.

New Albany Retrofit
I have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at New
Albany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currently
manufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the test
dates but we need to seek approval by ENA & OEC to use one of the Doyle
machines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clients
are extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Nox
system that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse
501D5A, ABB 11 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7.

FT4 Mobile Unit
I understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the first
ten units to "Learn out" the manufacturing and business process. This will
ease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited with
this program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply their
true skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He is
currently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine design
program for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage the
mobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrange
a program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeks
to get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in the
future. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as we
are already being approached with deals to place these units.

I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty to
Enron.

Attached is a spreadsheet summarising the current volunteers from our 
operating companies for this coming season of campus recruiting efforts for 
Analysts and Associates. This information comes from the program and I am 
told is accurate as of last week.

In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair 
to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to 
show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the 
recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of 
you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as 
being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, 
origination or assets to grow our businesses.

In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of 
you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting 
teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to 
step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my 
suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to 
Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the 
scheduled school presentation:

Dave-

Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29.
I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role 
for Andrea Reed.
I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural 
one with my eye on details and
the analysis process.

I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the 
Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business,
which you mentioned is now being formed.
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron.
She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' 
Industrial Chemicals Group.

Can you tell me to whom I should forward this?

Thanks,

Carol

Dear Carol:

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
might be kind enough to "keep their eyes open" and share thoughts and ideas
as to companies I should contact.

I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.

Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
make, the more opportunities I can uncover.

If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

Sincerely,

I have been discussing with Dave Delainey how we might align the 
compensation/rewards for the group of 4 or 5 VP's and Directors we have 
assigned to disposing of our large portfolio ($650mm). The project is due to 
complete in June 01 and Dave and my concern is whether we can make sure they 
are motivated to close on time and get the best possible price for us. Dave 
believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as 
$300mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales).

My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or 
concerns if any:

Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them 
and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following:

Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 
(ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this 
project we will pay you not less than $300k)

Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line 
value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more 
than $650mm we will grant you $200k in options, if above $800m then $350k in 
options.)

Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap.

David

Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your 
thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels 
and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the 
future vision for power and the overall organization including gas 
mid-market.  

Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to 
manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself 
the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the

I am no longer coordinating the "next-year" activities for new hires in the 
gas group so I thought I'd just let you know that the Midwest gas team is 
interviewing new hires for coverage/origination roles. I believe Laura is 
wanting to hire some of these folks to be based in Chicago and I would think 
you would want them to be located in Houston. Just fyi.

Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible.

Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently 
have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what 
Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.

Karen - let me know if it would be beneficial to brief Rick or Jeff.  I'll 
stop whatever I'm doing if necessary.  I think on this particular turbine 
purchase...... there is great interest from ENA, Calme, and EECC third pty.  
I agree that in general - we can't take our eye off the ball with respect to 
the long turbines.  F.Kelly

Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program 
some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is 
underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end 
of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have 
more details.

In as much as I have been one of the bigger supporters of the staff in the 
A/A program and the program itselt, I'm about at my ropes end with them.  How 
do we get control of the thing?

Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and 
values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages 
from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than 
our submission.  

Regards
Delainey

No, I don't think so.  TVA wants a two year PPA with 100% control, including 
AGC and hourly dispatch.  We would have to price the capacity and energy 
product they are asking for extremely high, and we run the risk of increasing 
our LD exposure in the pending litigation.

If Elizabeth thinks we can use the RFP to help our legal case, I would 
certainly support a response that helps our overall ecomomic position.

Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.  What is the 
drill?

Delainey

Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting.

Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP?

I do think DealBench was extremely valuable - and I'll say we - ENA - but 
what I really mean is you could not have gotten there nearly as quickly 
without it.  I think you agree.  By the same token, if they said 'free' up 
front, we don't have to pay.  I think this is really a negotiation between 
Dave and Greg if we want to move income to DealBench.

Congrats on your deals. JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in 
San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole 
thing.

With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have 
derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data 
rooms.  We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.

I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and 
my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has 
changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and 
external partners we are trying to get to.  Hence we want to bill internal 
customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.

I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was 
going to have to do this, considering my business situation)

Harry

Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware 
of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.  I 
have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled.

I wasn't sure whether you were messing with me or serious during the QBR 
about the Ada boiler pump.  It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal 
course of operations and NBD in the scope of things.  The QF was never at 
risk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available.

The QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage 
sourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational 
difficulties, etc.)  I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, 
although FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.  Typically the 
utility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying 
with FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or 
cease paying.  

Recently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a 
technical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in 
court (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status 
(financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal).

To me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being 
delivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.  The plant managers 
typically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the 
PPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host.  
Historically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon 
a QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.  If FERC was a 
tough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high 
on their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case.

It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality 
Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other 
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted 
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a 
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent 
with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power 
business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As 
part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and 
decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, 
this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic 
direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a 
pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon 
starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The 
Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The 
meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, 
staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on 
this Friday.  

Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire 
meeting and to be on time.

Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which 
does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this 
is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in 
seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation 
company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 
2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via 
the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current 
SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency 
power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.  
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets 
that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and 
constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  

The benefits include:
 a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the 
opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the 
possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, 
Capstone and Elektryon;
 b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe 
that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize 
this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer 
applications;
 c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of 
critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this 
venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in 
our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;
 d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital 
would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology 
did not work or the market did not materialize;
 e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;
 and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.

However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other 
Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company 
and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the 
technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful 
application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.

Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a 
very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of 
the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently 
operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering 
expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause 
at a fixed number for their 50% .

If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I 
will set up a meeting.

afternoon and leave Sunday AM ( millly ) and Afternoon for me.

John called me yesterday and he wants to Golf, Fri, Sat, Sun.  

1. We now have 5 people right?   Even if we have 5 it will be fine. Davies is 
still considering this ( I will let you know ). 
2.  I will look into golf arrangements once we have a firmer head count and 
determine when to play.. 

When and how often do you want to golf ?  

Milly and I are up for playing every day. I am thinking Friday afternoon.  
Saturday afternoon, and Sunday am ( 10:00 or so ). 

There is a great golf course ( TPC @ Canyons ) that I am trying to get us 
on.  The Desert Inn is closed while we are there.

Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an 
interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would 
request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an 
additional two weeks starting today.

Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional 
permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta 
PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the 
winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.

Dave,
FYI, 
On Tuesday, I pulled the trigger on the VPP for Crescendo.  The total was 
just in excess of $8,000,000.  I have executed ISDA for the financial swaps 
and am awaiting final doc's for the Enfolio Master Agreement for execution.  
I have passed this on to Lavorato.  The transaction proceeded fairly 
smoothly.  I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his 
group.  He suggested that we continue to work through Fred.  Fred, John 
Prevatt, and Arnold were very helpful in enabling me to pull the trigger at 
the peak of the curve on Tuesday.  I am no longer "spec - ing" gas.  It was 
fun while it lasted.
I will keep you posted.

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Thanks for the message.  I appreciate your responses to my August 8 memo and 
agree that the deal you are currently proposing looks alot closer to the deal 
we had been discussing with TXU.  As far as negotiating approach is 
concerned, my intention was not to retrade our deal, but frankly your team's 
approach up until your recent response certainly suggested that you were.  As 
we considered our options, we used the time to scrub our economics and as I 
think Jim Noles told you, have discovered that our economics have 
deteriorated (significantly).  Not your fault/problem, but a real issue for 
me.  I have my people looking at the deal again to see if we can offer some 
creative suggestions to improve the deal for us (without killing you).  At 
the end of the day, I want to do this deal; but I can't do an uneconomic 
deal. By the way, the other parties who signed up with TXU all did so in the 
$26-27.5 range (energy and RECs), suggesting that our deal for you is way 
under market.  I am committed to pushing hard to get this deal done!  Let's 
talk later this week once my team hooks up with yours to see if we have a way 
forward.  Adam

Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per 
your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have 
accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to 
what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is 
paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the 
term to twelve years from ten.

I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than 
a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the 
case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron 
Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the 
merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction 
with ENA versus TXU.

I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.

Delainey

Rebecca, looks fine to me.

Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first 
born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this 
next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team 
are doing.

Just a reminder, the East Midstream QBR will be held tomorrow....

   DATE:   AUGUST 24, 2000
   TIME:    1:00 PM TO 4:00 PM
   PLACE:   EB 3321
   TOPIC:   EAST MIDSTREAM QBR

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact either Kay (3x0643) or 
Beverly (5x7857).  I will look forward to seeing you there.

This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I 
then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not 
included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA 
Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on 
board.

Let me know if this isn't what you needed.

Thanks,

Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I 
expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday 
is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of 
service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost 
and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other 
business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy. 

I make money you make money.

Thanks for your cooperation.

this includes my senior team (Parquet, Mcdonald, Vickers, Thomas).  I am 
correct?

Regards,

Chris

PS - I spoke with Tim and we will be ready to price energy and ancilleries 
with respect to SDG&E.  I will work with Steffes on timing, pr and SDG&E 
strategy.  Sorry I sounded negative, but I was voicing Tim's concern as 
well.  Our risk is significant; we just dont want to make it worse.  

Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing 
your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our 
agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent 
internally and externally to manage this job.  I see very little effort in 
continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.

Steve and Bob:

I know that John Normand told you yesterday that he had sign-off up his chain 
of command on the deal you negotiated with him.  However, Dick apparently 
does not agree with John or has had second thoughts.  Please review the 
attached memo and let's discuss next steps.  It would also be helpful if one 
of you would get a download from John as to the reason behind this change in 
position.

Best regards - Max

Note to Dave:  I suggest that Steve, Bob and I take this up with Dick before 
involving you.  This is a 180 degree turn from what we had been discussing 
with Dick, John Normand and the rest of their team.  Dick and I were supposed 
to have a 1 pm video call today to confirm the deal that had been worked out, 
but he cancelled the call when he sent his e-mail to me.  We'll figure out 
what's up and keep you posted./ Max

Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you 
a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far 
better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market 
deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I 
would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, 
resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.

Wayne Mays and I are trying to assess technical support requirements for the 
next 12-24 months.  We would like to talk with each of you to get you input 
on the direction the company is going, and what type and level of support is 
likely to be required as we go forward.

If possible, we'd like to schedule a brief (30 minute) conference call, 
preferably within the next week, with each of you to discuss these issues.  
If you have a time that would be convenient, please let me and/or Wayne know 
so that we can get it scheduled.

Thanks!

Dave has reserved a Plane to take all of you to Las Vegas for the Offsite, 
December 13th.  We have no idea  what time the PRC will be over; however, at 
the conclusion of the PRC everyone should plan to go straight to the Hanger 
to board the aircraft.  

I just got confirmation last night that I have the plane, so I really don't 
have any details at this point.  As soon as I get the information, I will 
make packets for each of you with directions to the hanger.

We are asking that you make your own reservations for the return since 
everyone will be leaving at different times.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring 
responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue 
to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing 
and monitoring ENA's piece.

Thanks for the note Mat.  Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed!   

Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts...., we have been 
told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine "book" (with 
input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions 
w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those 
sessions).  Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by 
multiple parties, including board presentations.  The idea was that different 
business units (ENA,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and....., RAC's 
involvement would enhance the list.   

If ENA is going to keep "the turbine book" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none 
of our business, but...., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same 
thing you are doing).    

Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)?  

Also - do you have a rep that can attend the bi-weekly turbine lunches where 
we go through the list - coordinating turbine efforts across all business 
units?  

Thanks - F.Kelly

Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
includes 3 worksheets:

Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
commitment and other related items.
LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
other related items.
LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
and current availability.

In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
Only format:

O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls

It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
there is other information that would be useful, let us know.

Thanks,

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

for the four of us over the next few weeks.  

Regards
Delainey

Attached are first drafts of reports for Dave Delainey that detail assets 
that may or may not pose a technical risk for ENA. The current draft was 
developed with input from Wayne Mays, Mark Dobler and Andrea Reed.

I would be most appreciative if each of you would review these reports at 
your earliest convenience and respond back with your comments/updates.  
Please note:   In the Technical book dated 8/03 there are 2 tabs - Risk and 
No risk.

Dave has asked for this report to be updated monthly for inclusion in a 
reporting package for ENA's Office of the Chair.  After we are satisfied that 
this is the proper format and is all inclusive I will communicate a process 
for monthly updates.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

will be from 8:30 am to 11:30 am so that we can have the Friday afternoon 
budget and staff meeting.  The QBR will be held in EB3321.

Thanks.

Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think 
this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring 
more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results 
overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to 
evaluate future leaders.

Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE 
and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by 
Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run 
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to 
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect 
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing 
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily 
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will 
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

It is not a bad model just a different one.

Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall 
Street.

David:  This is a very intersting article for you to consider when the 
management considers what businesses Newco should include.  This article 
suggests that a combination of physical assets and trading are best.  That 
may  be true for US and Europe markets, but maybe not for lesser developed 
countries.

Analyst: Koch Venture Adds Value To Entergy-FPL Merger
By Bryan Lee
  
08/10/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The trading venture between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and 
Koch Industries will get a big boost from the utility's planned merger with 
FPL Group (FPL), marrying trading floor expertise with a commanding array of 
power plant assets.

So says Diane Borska, director of the utilities and energy practice at 
Cambridge, Mass.-based Fuld Inc., a consulting firm specializing in 
"competitive intelligence." 
In April, Entergy and Koch formed a joint venture to trade electricity and 
natural gas. 

The Koch joint venture is "the real killer thing about this merger," Borska 
said in an interview, in which she elaborated on her observations in a "white 
paper" analyzing the Entergy-FPL transaction. 

Once completed, the merger will put the combined company at the vanguard of 
competitive energy companies seeking convergence between physical assets and 
trading floor and risk management expertise, Borska said. 

Many companies are strong in trading floor and risk management expertise, but 
lack physical assets they can leverage in competitive electricity markets, 
Borska observed. 

On the other hand, utilities are rich in physical assets, but lack trading 
floor expertise, she said. 

In the past, "the people who have excelled have not necessarily had physical 
assets," Borska said. 

But in the future, "the people who are going to dominate are going to have 
both huge national asset portfolios and top-tier trading and risk management 
expertise," she said. "It's not going to one or the other." 

Koch has been in the top 20 in terms of trading energy. But adding the 
tremendous portfolio of power plant assets involved in the Entergy-FPL merger 
will undoubtedly bump Koch's trading into the top 10 or top five, Borska 
predicted. 

The stock transaction valued at $7 billion will bring together 48,000 
megawatts of power generation capacity, creating the nation's largest 
electric utility company with 6.3 million customers. 

Included in that staggering generation portfolio are 10,000 megawatts of 
so-called "merchant" power plants, which solely sell wholesale energy into 
competitive bulk-power markets, rather than serve a retail customer base. 

These competitive-market merchant plants are geographically dispersed in a 
complementary way, distributed among five regional power market hubs in the 
Northeast and mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Gulf South and Western 
states, Borska noted. 

The two companies' existing development pipeline would triple the existing 
10,000 megawatts merchant generating capacity, and plans call for growing the 
business into a 70,000-megawatt merchant-plant portfolio, Borska noted. 

"Additions to the fleet will come from additional nuclear power plant 
acquisitions and from green-field development of gas-fired plants," Borska 
noted in her white paper analysis of the transaction. 

The companies will be able to piggy-back onto Koch's 10,000-mile network of 
pipelines to supply their planned gas-fired power plant additions, Borska 
noted. 

The merger, when combined with the access to gas supply and trading-floor 
expertise of Koch, should cause investors to re-examine the higher valuations 
given pure-play generation companies compared to generation-rich combination 
companies, Borska said. 

AES Corp. (AES) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) have huge market valuations, but 
aren't known for engaging in "large, deep trading," she said. 

"Their ability to fully leverage their assets in the marketplace has been 
limited," Borska said. 

The Entergy merger with FPL, when considered in light of the Koch joint 
venture, "raises the bar for a Calpine or an AES" to gain the capability to 
leverage their significant physical assets, Borska said. 

Other energy companies, such as Dynegy (DYN) and Duke Energy (DUK), marry 
significant generation assets with trading floor sophistication, Borska 
conceded. 

But they aren't on the same scale or geographic scope as the Entergy-FPL-Koch 
combination, she said.

Kevin,

How are things going?  Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal 
with California or the wildfires out west?  Things are going well for us 
here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) 
and Europe (96/97).  The Japanese utilities are not being too original in 
their approach... same playbook.  Regardless of all of this, looking at sites 
and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look 
quite promising.  Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing 
LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the 
characteristics.

You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your 
efforts at adding capacity in the East.  Along these lines would you know of 
anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?  
Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.  Let me know.

Joe

I will be in Houston next week and we can discuss if you want to.  The idea 
here was not to explain the retail product offering or any concern of 
dropping the ball, rather a one off download of where we currently stand in 
South America  and high level overview of  how to work together to keep 
everyone on the same sheet of music and not miss  a beat.  For instance, 
there is already a local staff in place to handle initial deal flow (which is 
already happening) that needs to benefit from Dan's systems and best 
practices, but which has already based what they are doing on how Dan 
operates.  We have always benefited from as much of Dan's and Marty's 
attention as we could get over the past year and a half as we set this up.   
By the same token we can't be competitive in this business in Brazil on a 
cost basis from Houston, so that is why we have formed local staff based on 
EES systems and practices, and hopefully some controls as we go forward.  It 
is late here and my assistant is gone but I think the meeting is already 
scheduled.  If you can't be there maybe we can backbrief you.

David W Delainey@ECT
11/30/2000 11:21 AM
Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake

Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting. 

Today's Staff & Budget Meeting has been cancelled.  Please make a note on 
your calendars.

Because of a scheduling conflict earlier in the month, we had to cancel our 
original plans for dinner.  The plans have been revised as follows:

  DATE:  August 18, 2000
  PLACE:  The Wine Room
     River Oaks Grill
     2630 Westheimer
     713/520-1738
  TIME:   6:30 PM

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Kay 
(3X0643) or Beverly (5X7857).  

I will look forward to seeing you there.

Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the 
risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Currently, Enron has several contractual disputes with Siemens/Westinghouse.  
These include:  $5-10MM lingering from Marmara; about $4-5MM on Puerto Rico; 
and maybe $1-3MM on the Gleason and Indiana Peakers.

In my meeting with Randy Zwirn yesterday, Randy suggested that I meet with 
him in an attempt to come to a global settlement on all the Enron disputes.  

I propose to do this.  I understand the strength of the contractual issues on 
each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing 
the Enron leverage in one global settlement.  The process will take from 
30-60 days as both sides collect all contractual arguments.

I'll keep ENA informed.

Let me know if either of you object to this global type approach.

However, they did suggest that you might like to consider a Permanent

Regards
Delainey

As I mentioned to you earlier, there is much interest/concern about managing 
the ENE portfolio of turbines, both from a balance sheet and a deal 
perspective, as a result I've had numerous data requests in the last few 
weeks including one today from RAC.

I thought you might be interested in the comment I have highlighted below, in 
blue, regarding the LM6000's.

Tammy

Fred L Kelly@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
08/03/2000 03:09 PM
Thanks Mike - the effort underway (by RAC and EECC) is an overall Enron 
turbine effort, to which the LM6000's are a subset.  Rick Buy must report to 
Skilling and the board on the "long" turbine position....... thus the current 
effort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be 
keeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with 
input from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we 
don't have redundant list efforts going.  

Matt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I 
think some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  
I will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  

Additionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using 
to track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are 
intended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  

Finally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the 
LM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure 
that Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were 
not listed).  

In summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so 
we can remove unneccessary work.  

Thanks for the note!  F.Kelly

Mike Coleman
08/03/2000 12:16 PM
To avoid confusion, we should not have everyone generating separate turbine 
lists.  Matt Gimble at ENA/Houston is sheperding a comprehensive list and is 
setting it up at a site that everyone can access.  The current issue is 
attached.  When Matt has the site location set up, I will notify you.

Thanks!

It includes an overal Turbine Inventory, Brian Hulse's LM6000 schedules and 
an LM6000 Timing page.
The LM6000 Configuration is Ben Jacoby's schedule.

As soon as Tammy and I set up the protection on the Master Turbine Schedule, 
I will send you its
location.

Of the $2.582 MM payable to Bear, Stearns in conjunction with their advisory

February, a total of $2.251 MM was accrued in March of this year.

The net P&L impact will therefore be limited to $331,123.

Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical 
risk as a part of this reporting procedure.  Wayne can you set up a meeting 
for the four of us over the next few weeks.

Delainey

Attached are first drafts of reports for Dave Delainey that detail assets 
that may or may not pose a technical risk for ENA. The current draft was 
developed with input from Wayne Mays, Mark Dobler and Andrea Reed.

I would be most appreciative if each of you would review these reports at 
your earliest convenience and respond back with your comments/updates.  
Please note:   In the Technical book dated 8/03 there are 2 tabs - Risk and 
No risk.

Dave has asked for this report to be updated monthly for inclusion in a 
reporting package for ENA's Office of the Chair.  After we are satisfied that 
this is the proper format and is all inclusive I will communicate a process 
for monthly updates.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Mark, Dave and John

Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing 
proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by 
Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.  
Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is 
that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and 
execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is 
an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. 
The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule 
between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia 
Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business 
is the perview of ECC.

Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the 
deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done 
and can help in the pitch.

Delainey
Rob Milnthorp
08/03/2000 04:17 PM
Dave, my thoughts regarding your note:

This is not what we agreed to in Columbia Lakes. You were very clear on the 
point that ENA Industrial Marketing had enough to do South of the border. We 
have staffed up our Industrial Marketing Team in Toronto and are covering all 
industrials (on a full-time basis) which meet our load threshold in Ontario. 
Unlike the U.S., Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have 
complete coverage. Paul and his group have done a tremendous job at 
positioning Enron in this marketplace, demonstrating our core competencies, 
and developing credibility. The last thing I want is some marketer up here 
from the U.S. selling the box without knowing how to fill that box (ie does 
not know the market fundamentals, rules or regulatory regime). This does 
nothing for Enron as it confuses the customer on who they should be talking 
to and destroys whatever credibility we had created to date. I have attached 
for your reference, a status report on industrial coverage.

Perhaps the problem lies in how we are defining outsourcing. As you know, 
there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy 
island concept. Enron Canada has been pitching the entire outsourcing 
continuum recognizing that for many of these industrials, they will want to 
walk before they run. The majority that we have talked to are interested in 
portfolio management, our market expertise & information, wholesale 
settlement services, and assistance with market opening readiness. I cant 
imagine how a U.S. originator could talk to or offer these services to 
Canadian Industrials. This is clearly in Enron Canada's wheelhouse.

With respect to the opposite side of the outsourcing continuum, it makes 
total sense to have ENA utilize its resources in pursuing energy island, 
asset outsourcing type structures. With these opportunities, I see ENA taking 
the lead with ECC second chair. Where these opportunities are identified by 
ECC, we will forward these to the appropriate ENA originator. To date, ENA 
and ECC have worked well on Blue Circle, Terra, Co-Steel and Nexfor.

As for Tembec, I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal 
team. Kelli Metcalf has been up here twice talking to Tembec about a cogen in 
an area that does not make any economic sense. Jan and Paul have met with 
Tembec a number of times and we have had extensive discussions with Tembec 
specific to Ontario, Portfolio Management, Wholesale Settlement Services, 
Supply Procurement, and Asset Optimization. I realize that Bryan Burnett has 
an excellent relationship with Tembec and we should leverage off of this, but 
to simply "keep ECC in the loop" is fundamentally absurd and is not in 
Enron's best interests.

Regards
Milnthorp

David W Delainey
08/03/2000 12:09 PM
Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the 
meeting and deliver the "Enron" message, but going forward we need to have 
this resolved.

Cheers, Paul D

I agree 400% - I look forward to your plan.

SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an "emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
"fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

Jim

Larry, my understanding is that ESA has taken four units and that Janet 
Dietrich in conversations with ESA has made four more available to ESA 
subject to them getting their deal approved by the board.  So I do not 
believe Enron needs to committ to additional LM units at this time.

Guys, although I am hesitant to get in between ESA and ENA on this issue, my 
perception is that there is some confusion; we need to sort out at the top.  
Let me describe what I understand of the facts.  

First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's.

Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the "ready to ship date" as shown on 
the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as 
far as I understand.

Third, GE/S&S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if 
we need to.  The "ready to ship dates" for these new LM 6000's are between 
January - March, 2001.  We could possibly get these at the current preferred 
pricing (as a current contract change order).

ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of 
the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - 
March, 2001.  Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's 
currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?  Is ENA earmarking four 
additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?  If 
not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, 
which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet.

My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend 
that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what 
we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain 
the purchase of the new LM 6000's.  Let me know if I can help.

Dave,

Here is the list of folks involved in Cuiaba.

Laine Powell and his team - Project execution team for Cuiaba, located in 
Cuiaba
Jose Anson - Develpment -  Engineering/Permitting
Joan Carlos Albuquerque - FURNAS/Eletrobra relationship
Valeria Lima - ANP relationship
Daine Duarte - Local in Cuiaba.  Sounds like formally part of Lammers' team, 
but practically part of Laine's team
Jose Lucio dos Reis Neto - Agencies involved in electric system operation.  
Recovery oil fuel oil costs (complicated story/very important task)
Jose Bestard - Project continuity.  Original PPA negotiations
John Novak - Lawyer...key to financing
Rob Gay - Financing lead...key to financing
Rick Lammers - Commercial project lead

I sent this on top of Pete Weidler's e-mail and summarized a good part of it 
above.  Only Lammers and Gay were not mentioned in Pete's e-mail.

Another thought...pull people in from EE&CC as part of the "new team".  No 
basis in fact here, but I suspect there are too many contractor/owner games 
going on.  Probably need the EE&CC key people list as well.  Do you want me 
to shake it loose, do you want to work it with Leff, or bad idea?

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thanks,

KIsh

Joe - this is the list I asked Laine to put together. - I asked him not to 
list all the folks under Laine - as I assume they stay with the project no 
matter where it goes.

Jose Anson - he is the coordinator of permitting at IBAMA and ANP for the 
pipeline.  He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of 
his efforts on the IBAMA license.  Key person.

Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he 
is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.  Not only does he know 
folks but he also gets things done within the system.

Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.

Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the 
year after which she has been dialed out.  Have asked Rick several times 
about her future with his group.  She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to 
relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that 
are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.

Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.  He 
has been a key to our success on the CCC account.  He is a must to making the 
project successful.  Knows the contacts and basically understands the project 
from the regulatory and CCC account point-of-view.

Two other people that are not involved in "our side" of fence on a daily 
basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.  Jose knows the 
history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.

But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?  Need this

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete

Let me know your thoughts after you speak with him.

Craig is coming by today to pitch a few ideas.  I'll let you know what he 
comes up with (or if you'd like to be present when he does, let me know and 
I'll get it on your calendar).  Do you have any preliminary ideas?

On another note, last night was a great idea, and I think it went a long 
way.  Thanks for the intro to the group.

Thanks

Need input if anyone thinks we need more turbines than John Schroeder/GE has 
forecasted.  My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we 
will need (which is OK).  

The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron....... and 
determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 2002/2003 timeframe (the 
previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's 
wouldn't be available till 1Q03).  John stated that he didn't know what the 
request from Schenectady meant....., but....., maybe a few production slots 
were coming available as things shake out.....  John told them that he 
thought Enron might be interested in:

qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESA
qty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexico
qty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NA

John is asking us........, "that would be enough...... right?".  We don't 
need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want 
less than he forecasted, but....., if someone knows something I don't, 
and....., we would want more turbines than the above......., please let us 
know.  

On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines 
for Saudi, and....., "an island project".  

Regards - F.Kelly

Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is 
similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:

 a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the 
paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination;
 b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no 
outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron 
Mexico; 
 c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I 
would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in 
which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work 
together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding 
outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC 
and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico 
coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in 
Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to 
clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people 
and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer 
(ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the 
sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and 
execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am 
expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for 
Canada and Mexico;
 and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at 
this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and 
if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to 
ECC.

Rodney, Edward, Jim - We've been over this issue a number of times and I 
thought we had reached resolution when we last met with Delainey.  My 
understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:

1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and 
Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian 
Facilities.

2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.

3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp & Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp & 
Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.  ECC will cover these industrials for all 
other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs 
to be co-ordinated.

Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to 
talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC 
has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US 
facilities.

It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to 
get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.  In the 
interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing 
arrangement.

Rob, We just had a very good meeting with Tembec about Energy procurement and 
energy outsourcing.  While the meeting went well, I am very confused about 
the Enron team making the pitch to them.  My understanding is that the 
Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian 
companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps 
and to some extent, new SPV's.

In this instance,

1.  Tembec is a Canadian Company
2.  All their assets are in Canada
3.  Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility
4.  We know the executive team at Tembec
5.  We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy 
market which is their focus right now
6.  We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement 
similar to the US pitches

With this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up 
here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and 
hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.  Kelly was quite vocal in saying 
that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.  I have stated to 
her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and 
knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.  Obviously, much of the 
technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team 
put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.  
However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this 
office!!!

I thought this had been agreed to already.  We managed to piece up the

this resolved.

I have told Michele that we will want to apply the full force of the 
no-compete which should keep him out of the market thru Feb 3, 2001.

I'll keep you updated.

Edward, you are very welcome and I appreciate all the efforts to ensure the

Regards
Delainey

Dave,

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO - what's next?  

I am working with Bryan and Ray on the transition, everything seems to be 
going along smoothly.  Bryan is comfortable with me moving as soon as EBS has 
physical space for me as long as I am available to him by phone.  I expect to 
move next week.

I am working on a scheme with Wes on marking the swaps on Garden State 
without fair valuing the asset.  Citibank and National Bank of Canada are 
interested, and the trade should improve the economics as a result of trading 
with a strong credit (bank) as opposed to a stand alone operation (Garden 
State).  I should have more feedback by the end of the week.

Thank you for your support on my move to EBS.  I have really enjoyed working 
with you and appreciate what you have done for me.  Working with you, Greg 
and Rodney has really improved my management, finance and structuring skills 
that I expect to apply at EBS.

Call me if there is anything I can ever to do to support you.  I look forward 
to working with you again.  

Thanks for being a terrific boss and good friend.

Edward

Julie and Jean,
Pursuant to our telephone conversation this morning, this e-mail is intended 
to update the status of project 20/20.
There are 6 major items that need to be completed prior to closing this 
transaction.  The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below:

Closing Item   Expected Completion Date Status
1. Execution of LOU  August 4   Several issues remain to be negotiated.
        I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the 
issues.

August 3.
        Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2.

2. Employment Issues  August 14   Offers of employment/transfer are in the 
process of being designed and prepared. Primary         issues include a) 
identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation 
(Shiela         Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being 
adequately addressed).
        b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation 
plans. I am working with Bill         Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on 
developing a plan that will address this issue.  Based on the         
conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this 
issue will be properly         addressed.  The plan is to have employment 
issues identified in a letter and presented to          employees on August 
7th.

3. Reserve Consultants  August 11   Kicked off consultants in a meeting in 
Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and         assisting in the 
process.

4. Due Diligence  August 25   A detailed schedule of all due diligence 
activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will         forward that 
schedule to you once I receive the update.

5. Hart, Scott Rodino  September 8-15   There is a high probability that a 
Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of         the 
LOU. There is a 30 day review period.  This may be the critical path item.

6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15   Shonnie Daniel is coordinating 
the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected         that 
this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September.

One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making 
a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be 
August 7).  They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode.

I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. 

Jennifer, you are very welcome and I look forward to continuing to work with 
you - all the best.

Delainey

Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting.  
I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I 
strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team 
on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and 
financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. 
Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent

I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are 
not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.

Thanks

Dave,

I am sorry that I was unable to meet with you yesterday on Cuiba.  Jim has 
told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.  Below is a note 
that I received this morning from Pete.  The meeting he is referencing is an 
indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.  You are more than 
welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know.

I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree 
that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking 
either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.  I would be happy to discuss with you 
why I recommend one of those two individuals.

Rebecca
Peter E Weidler@ENRON
11/29/2000 06:56 AM
the list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if 
the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it 
ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and 
some of the full time guys should take a back seat.

I would have the full time dedicated team be - 

Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he 
negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory 
system does and does not work.

Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right 
contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian 
resistance.  Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant.

John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit 
- has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be 
rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire 
project is wired together.

Rob Gay - Finance 

Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is 
producing 300 mw of power which is being sold and paid for.

Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -  he is relatively new to 
the project and seems satisfactory

Would recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line 
negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review 
overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. 

Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time.

Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting 
point - new deal.  Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get 
Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.    You 
will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months 
to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just 
financial close achieved.

This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his 
ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead 
developer - but has had lots of "help" from Bannantine and the entire team.   
Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.  I am not sure 
anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were 
some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight  - and some 
things that can be done better now.  The things that come be done better now 
- I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.  People need 
to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult 
to "take over" the project without making some changes in the way it is being 
run.   

For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present -

Rick Lammers
Laine Powell
Jose Bestard

Also in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and 
myself.

The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know 
if you would like him there.

You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy 
- just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and 
then straight to a listing of all things that need to get done to "finish" 
the project to the point where we have financial close and a functioning 
supply and PPA.

Joe and I and Rob will be in Houston and the rest of the team will dial in a 
conference call. 

Let me know if the above format is ok.

Attached is a memo regarding a meeting I had with our associates on July 17, 
2000.  Additionally, I met with Celeste Roberts on July 21 and held another 
meeting with the Associates on same date.

The planned dinners with the associates as well as the proactive approach ENA 
is taking with them is the correct course of action.

I met with 7 associates and 1 analyst  over lunch to discuss the Analyst and 
Associate Program.  The major concern expressed by everyone in the meeting 
was that the program has become a bureaucracy vs a meritocracy.  According to 
the Associates, the program has become inflexible on any issue and the only 
feedback they receive is "go talk to Skilling if you don't like the 
answers".  Another major concern was compensation.  After listening to the 
comments, my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be 
addressed.  Specific recommendations by this small group include (1) reduce 
amount of time in program before promotion to manager from 18 months to 12 
months, (2) increase Associates involvement in rotation decisions, (3) 
explanations of why the program is structured in a certain way without 
defensive comments of "go talk to Skilling", (4) generally, more of an open 
market approach so that we are using a "carrot vs stick" method to motivate 
behavior.

Let me know about the next meeting to discuss.

David -

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday, and discussing the Construction 
Exchange product concept.  I'm glad to hear that the Industrials Group  is 
already pursuing this type of project with their customers.  I look forward 
to their success, and believe this should bring significant value to Enron 
North America.

Thanks again for your time.

Rick

Mike, if you Janet or Dave can cut the deal with Izzo go ahead and speak to 
him.  I don't think there is any practical way to enforce any percieved call 
we have on Izzo so you will have to determine how much Larry really wants the 
trubine or how he could benefit from striking a different deal.

Dave,

In going through the turbine list over the last few days, EE&CC's, Sumas II- 
Goldendale (GE 7FA, Jun '01 delivery) turbine keeps popping up.  ENA could 
trade this turbine to several parties (Tenaska, Indeck) to get a lock on a QF 
restructuring.  Also, Sumas I still has restructruring value that EE&CC did 
not get a lock on in exchange for the EPC/turbine contract. 

As I recall, Larry Izzo promised to replace the GE 7FA turbine with a 
comparable machine with a Q4-2001 delivery date.  While the Goldendale EPC 
contract may executed and there may be nothing to do, there is significant 
value sitting on the table.  If we cannot get the Goldendale 7FA back, then 
can we enforce the replacement provision that was promised (as I remember) as 
part of your original deal with Larry Izzo?  I realize that at this point the 
politics may prevent us from doing anything.  However, I at least want to get 
you thinking about it just in case there was a way to get a turbine to trade 
for larger value than an EPC contract for EE&CC.

Regards,

Mike J. Miller 

Jim, I would forward to Chris Calger, Janet Dietrich and Jean Mrha.

Questions should be directed to my attention at (713) 853-6978.  

Laura, I spoke to Tom about his retail proposals, I told him that you would 
coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.  I only want 
Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have 
spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your 
call.

On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former 
Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson 
auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values 
inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes 
goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the 
appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least 
amount of time on this issue.

Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller 
about a couple weeks back?

Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in 
the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like 
to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't 
think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him 
know.  I probably need to get back to him either way shortly. Thanks.

07/19/2000 02:03 PM
Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation 
of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of 
value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your 
continued management.

Jordan
Kevin Liss@ENRON
07/19/2000 12:42 PM
Our memorandum of today's date on the DQE facilities estimates a 65% to 70% 
likelihood of the facilities qualifying for section 29 tax credits, based on 
projected volumes of 225 tons per hour.

As we discussed a week ago, if we operate the facilities at a volume of 118 
per hour, (i.e., half-capacity), we believe we would alleviate the tax risk 
associated with the increase in capacity.  The question is, does that 
improvement in the odds with respect to that one issue improve the 
bottom-line odds on qualification at least with respect to the base volume of 
118 per hour from the 65% to 70% estimate that we specified in our memorandum?

We think it does, but we are not sure that there will be a material 
improvement.  We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel, and 
will let you know his view.  

As we noted last week, there are several legal issues for which, while we 
think we have the better argument, there is no definitive legal precedent.  
Even pulling the capacity issue out of the equation --which is what we would 
be doing if we are only considering the 118 tons -- there are still several 
other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in 
order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.  When you look at each issue, 
separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you 
consider that there are several such issues, and that we have to be "right" 
each and every time, you have to lower your overall odds.  Statistically 
speaking, if you are 80% comfortable as to each of 5 separate issues, then 
you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5, not on 5 out of 5, but we can't lose 
on any one issue and still qualify for credits. 

Obtaining a private letter ruling from the IRS as to these issues, which is 
our ultimate goal, would take these issues out of the air, so to speak, but 
that's not going to happen pre-close, and no matter what assurances we might 
get at a pre-ruling conference with the IRS, unless and until you actually 
get the ruling, there is an element of risk that you have to assume.  For 
that reason, the 90% probability number that I threw out at last week's 
meeting in response to a question about what our comfort level would be if we 
had a private letter ruling is really a red herring, because at decision 
time, there's not going to be a ruling in hand.  

As noted above, I will let you know what Bruce Lemons' view is, since he is 
the one who will be called upon to give an opinion. Hopefully, that will be 
later today.

Guys, lets set up a meeting between the three of us on Monday ASAP to 
discuss.  I have a few ideas and I probably need to go have dinner with Lew 
to get him comfortable.  This may be setting up to be a larger asset 
management transaction.  Don can you try and find a time next week with Lew 
for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and 
out that day.  If not next week then early the following.  I think it will 
take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.

At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) 
Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc.

The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well.

Dave,

As I mentioned in my voicemail last night, I spoke with Randy and Aldo.  The 
tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole 
story.  All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, 
NewCo will not be a world class Genco.  With that said, it is apparent that 
Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what 
exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk 
Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew 
would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to 
NewCo, particularly with $400-$500 million of equity tied up in this entity.  
Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to 
Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this 
entity.  I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it 
is also philosophy, style and approach.  Given that we have said that we 
would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be 
looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&M people, but immerse them in our 
philosophy.  They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that 
coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading 
is probably not the right answer.  Given the dynamic nature of Enron and 
Trading in general,  making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will 
be tough.

We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they 
can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly 
increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get 
adequately compensated for this);  tight labor market in general and the fact 
that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the 
early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is 
FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize 
FPLE Traders).  We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.

Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.  If you want to talk today, I will 
be around.

Thanks,

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a 
list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a 
definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could 
be acted upon.

 a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;
 b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day 
and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;
 c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 
5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;
 d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.;
 e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and 
contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;
 f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - 
working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al 
- Patrick   W.
 
 I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to 
determine a final action plan.

Regards
Delainey

Dave,  I met with my team today and based on the data and information 
supplied by Steve, it is doubtful that the assets and on-going organization 
would command a current market value equivalent to book.  I am still willing 
to move the assets onto our balance sheet at book for the benefit of Enron, 
although if this was a third party bid, I would be surprised if we could pay 
this price.  Furthermore, due to your desire to maintain this discussion 
among the Houston teams only, I am assuming the PDP reserves are solid, no 
major enviornmental issues exit, legal problems are minimal and contracts are 
standard.  Let me know what you want to do. I think we have all spent enough 
time on this effort. 

On a side issue, are you aware that this is a JEDI I property?  My 
understanding is that Jedi I owns 100% of C-GAS and the Jedi I fund WILL be 
liquidated before the end of the year.  At what price will your unit pay to 
liquidate the fund?

Folks,
Attached is a list of 37 executives, not yet enrolled on the "exective impact 
and influence" programme administered by Dick Amabile.
The OTC clearly set the goal at the beginning of the year, and repeated again 
at Mid year, that all VPs and MDs need to have attended this programme by end 
of year 2000. Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs 
and MDs at the executive PRC.

Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or 
cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). 

HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the 
suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet 
with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list 
of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. 
Please do not leave that meeting without a date! A word of caution, it is 
remotely possible that some of these individuals may have enrolled in the 
very recent past, or have attended and this data not yet reached Dick's 
spreadsheet, so do double check that they haven't yet enrolled before 
twisting their arms..

The dates for the remaining programmes are also on the spreadsheet.

To enrol a VP or MD,  get their dates, give it to their assistants and tell 
them to directly contact Debbie Nowak on 33304.

Update on activity related to California price caps.  Key issue is that we

and find additional "no" votes.

Thanks,

Enron will take the initiative and help IEP jump-start the PR effort by the 
end of the week.  I spoke with Smutney this evening.  He likes the idea of 
Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.  I've emailed him the one-pager we 
worked up today.--Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,Parquet
The urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many 
trying to fill the void.  The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting 
with IEP and the utilities.  Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend.
I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is 
a "98% chance" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board 
meeting.
Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&E to determine when SDG&E plans to 
make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received 
last week.
Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the 
investment community energized on this issue.
The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.  Staffers 
are drafting a bill that an "at risk" Democrat Senator from San Diego will 
carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the 
election.  Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he 
has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views.
Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican 
block of the California PUC is hanging tough.

That's it from our end.

Best,
Jeff

Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not 
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product 
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large 
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority 
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I 
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business 
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

My assistant will be putting together a meeting/conference call for next 
WEdnesday on how to move forward with retail in South America given the plan 
to have retail report through the wholesale group in South America for 2001.  
Key points for discussion will be:

-brief overview of the state of the retail business in South America
-brief overview of the current retail organization and how it would report 
through wholesale
-discussion of how we  move from where we are currently (good value 
proposition, customer's signed up, organization to implement)  to make the 
retail business a success:
 -by having an interface with EES for best practices, systems, etc., 
 -under wholesale budget and organization for simplicity and cost sake

Wednesday is Mark's first day back in the office from Europe, Dan will be in 
Europe, Orlando will be in Brazil, others I believe in Houston, so we will 
try to accomodate everyone's schedules or at least get a quorum of those 
involved present on the call/meeting. 

Don, go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas 
side?

Did CSFB tell them about the $400 Kw capital cost plus the three year 
transistion agreement for $4.00 kw/m?

Tell Beverly or Kay to make time for next week if Mr Forster can make it.

Dave,

CSFB spoke with DPL today.  Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet 
with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and 
marketing side.  Besides 3200 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking 
strategy in ECAR and today has 400-500 MWs in development (interesting to 
have peaking strategy with no T&M).  They would like to look at our peakers 
to supplement strategy.  Forster didn't flinch when they said $400 kW is the 
ballpark number.  More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk 
with you about other ideas relating to T&M.  

Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.  You are more open on 
the 28th.  It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.  He wants CSFB 
and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.  CSFB is DPL's main advisor, and the 
guys that negotiated the KKR deal a while back.

Apparently we are talking with these guys on the gas side.

Regards,

Don 

looks fine to me

As a matter of fact, this is on my list to discuss with you. I think we 
should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick 
and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East 
Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me 
to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and 
have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first? 
The LM6000 position looks like this:

24 turbines allocated:

4 City of Austin
4 Enron South America
4 Las Vegas Cogen
6 Public Service of Colorado
6 Florida Merchant plant

Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to 
a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks. 
It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to 
back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or 
plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated 
to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll 
have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45% 
residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the 
process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to 
monetize the entire position.

We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are 
moving fairly slow.

I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you 
when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking 
to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM, 
ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider 
some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year 
term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe 
Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource 
needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk 
about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well.  

Let me know your thoughts! Thanks. 

Good job Rodney - keep me up to speed and let me know where I can help.

Delainey

I believe you would be the grief master on this subject at least in terms of 
"you better start delivering on this stuff".  By the way the pitch to 
Colonial pipeline went okay yesterday.  Good news - Bill Scott CEO said we 
were the only company that could deliver exactly what he asked for.  Bad news 
is that he thought it should be 25% lower.  I believe his reaction is simply 
a gut reaction from a former trader and we are following up with information 
to get him better educated as to why this is a good deal for him.  We have 
$20 - $30mm in the deal and this creates roughly $70mm of value or savings 
(depending on your assumptions) for Colonial.  I believe we can get to a 
trade with them.  I'll keep you updated.

Thanks,

This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
following split up of economics:

Savings to GE $33MM PV
Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
$40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.

I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.

Thanks,
Rodney

Don, couple of points:
 a) would take a page to describe the Bridgeline structure (ie) we have done 
this before;
 b) haven't we done more that 150,000 transactions?
 c) we are getting paid a fee for providing the back-office services?

Dave, I am seeking your approval to take my group on an offsite to Las Vegas 
sometime in late 3rd/early 4th quarter. Cost is approx Cdn $1000/person for 
flight and accomodation (thursday - sunday). As you know, we have done this 
for a number of years but I'm not sure what approvals were obtained in the 
past as it was either your group or Lavorato's group at the time. This would 
involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with 
the rest of Shankman's group. It should be noted also that we decided not to 
attend the Masters this year as we didnt think it generated enough business 
following last years trip -  this cut our expenses substantially. Please let 
me know your thoughts on this. 

Regards
Milnthorp

Whats's up with these machines - are we paying for past good luck?

Losing this 175 MW unit will cost us approx. $2.0 million in lost margin 
(higher if the South blows out).
	
	

Verified that one blade broke off from the 7th stage of blades in the 
compressor.  The shrapnel caused unreparable damage to 3 additional blades.  
From the pictures, it appears that one of the damaged blades was close to 
breaking off, and likely would have caused much more significant damage to 
the compressor AND turbine.

We've begun the process of removing the damaged blades.  Westinghouse has the 
repair lead, and so far, is giving it the right level of attention.  My plant 
manager's driving the effort on the ground, but I have a compressor engineer 
that will be at the site tomorrow to serve as my eyes and ears so Pete can 
concentrate on keeping the other two units running.

Barring as-yet undiscovered damage (doubtful), my best guess is that we lose 
next week, but get the unit back for the week of 24 July.  This hinges on 
Westinghouse securing four replacement blades which they are scrambling to 
do.  All costs should fall on Westinghouse warranty.

I'm collecting the information we might need in order to file a business 
process interruption insurance claim, but based on my best-guess schedule, I 
don't expect to file the claim.

As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate 
Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on 
a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly 
improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also 
need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA  
regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.

In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your 
groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's 
in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team 
Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) 
or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our 
A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this 
regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you 
may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A 
resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.

In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you 
to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm 
the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer 
another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply 
their name as soon as possible. 

Please call with any questions.

Please plan to attend a meeting Friday, December 1, 2000 at 7:00 am in

David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I 
wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly 
Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management  
team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management 
team and to "sell" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months 
rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the 
top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch 
them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame. 

For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until 
we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I 
assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. 
Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark 
when I get back.

Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.

Dave,

I believe this is waht you asked for. Say the word and we will get cracking.

David

Chris, did we get the DASH completed and approved on Pasotria and LV Cogen?

Rob, I have not heard what the plan of action is with Moore? 

Rob, what would be the necessary steps needed to book all or some of the 
Bruce deal in Q3?

Regards
Delainey

Guys, where is Rebox - it seems to have disappeared?  I assume you guys are 
working on the accounting issues necessary to book the swaps on the Garden 
State deal.

Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys 
working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy 
over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation 
does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with 
us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.

This guys sounds a little off.

=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. "It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices."
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  "The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot," said
the
Raymond James report. "Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise."
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  "Coal will not go away," said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
"The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap."
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  "You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years," he predicted. "In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes."
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  "If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on," said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is "very possible."
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a "transport reactor," a device based on
existing technology used to "crack" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  "The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices," said Goodman. "At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu."

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  "The $64 question is the price of gas," said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very 
pleasant.  I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with 
an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.  I'm also starting to think 
as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris 
should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.  Something to think about, I 
am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without 
some resource availability.  I think you have to feel pretty good about the 
LM position first.  Something to think about?

Hey Dave, what's the real deal on the 7FA "swap" with Larry Izzo? Do they 
have the capability to give us another 7FA in 2001-2002? I listened to two 
voicemails from Cogentrix this am and they do seem to be serious about 
purchasing an incremental 1-2 7FA's if they can be delivered by winter 2002. 
I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Rob

I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can 
see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting.

I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons) if possible.

Steve,

Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.

We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
overall message.

Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.

Thanks,
Dan Marcontell

A TV program in Brazil this morning announced that an investment bank has 
been hired to help Enron sell Elektro.  Attached are the latest statement and 
Q and As.  Who in IR needs to see this?  

I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the 
presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking 
points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the 
points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in 
addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should 
develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our 
growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- 
Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees 
on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a 
professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation 
incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across 
the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and 
a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.

I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting 
before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Attached are my suggestions.

Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy 
savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; 
not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are 
working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the 
final.

Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.

Rice recruiting team,

As some of you are aware, Enron is sponsoring  sell weekends (Dec 1 and Dec 
8) for all the candidates that have received offers.  The Rice team is 
organizing a dinner for the Jones School candidates this Friday evening (Dec. 
1) at Tony Ruppe's.  I am looking for 5 to 8 Enron Jones School recruiters to 
attend the dinner on Friday.  

Please let me know if you will be able to attend.

Thanks,

I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a 
significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's 
(author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".  We have looked at 
numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so 
low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target 
audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on 
the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time.  
I'll ask Margaret Allen to handle the decline.

The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
we need to show them that as well.

The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.

They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
given them in the past -- primarily because they met so many senior Enron 
executives.  It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also 
come by to meet them.

Thanks.

tcwillia@duke-energy.com on 11/27/2000 02:23:42 PM
The note below was sent to the 20 or so reporters that I have been working
with on the CA electricity crisis.

FYI.

Below is a press release we distributed today that details a proposal we
have made to San Diego Gas & Electric to manage their entire electricity
load (up to 3,300 megawatts) for five years at a fixed price of $60 a
megawatt hour.  The proposal was detailed in our comments to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions to
Caifornia.

As the release indicates, forward contracting for electricity is a very
effective way for the state's utilities to manage the volitility in the
state's electricity markets.  With natural gas prices more than doubling
since last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last year
on the spot market (up to $19 a million BTU vs. an average of about $2.50
in 1999), we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage of
these contracts so they can manage their own risk  exposure and their
customer's risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices.
(The price of natural gas represents about 90 percent of our plant's
operating costs).

We signed a forward power contract with PG&E Oct. 30 and Southern Cal
Edison Nov. 15 (announced for the first time in the this release).  The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind of
contracts -- and we hope that we, or other wholesale power marketers, can
do more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDG&E in the very
near future to bring stability to the state's wholesale electricity market.

Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing, which
also includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis.
These are also detailed on our CA web site at
www.Duke-Energy.com/California.

For more information, call me at 805-595-4270 or page me at 877-364-5170.

I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to 
see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's 
problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling 
them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an 
opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc.  
What do you think?

Unfortunately, today in an unprecedented move the Alberta Government 
over-ruled the Power Pool on its decision yesterday not to amend the Power 
Pool Rules and exclude importers from setting pool price.  The Minister 
signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports 
from influencing the determination of the pool price.   The Power Pool has 
been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation.  Larry 
Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of 
advice not to do it from Larry.   Apparently the Premier met with 
representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the 
Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by  Enmax (the 
City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 
1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn.   

Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from 
Blakes.  The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether 
we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes 
this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our 
participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday.  The fear is that our 
conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow 
estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA.   
Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here 
(Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a 
paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government. 

Regards,

Rob

Steve,

Thanks for your courtesy this morning, and recommendations for further 
contacts.  (By copy of this transmission I'm sending my resume' on to Rick, 
Jose' and Miguel, as you suggested.)  Much of the work I've done in the last 
fifteen years has been involved government affairs, in one way or another.  
Either I was dealing with state and federal regulatory agencies in the US, 
working on political campaigns in Florida and Texas, or negotiating with 
international governments preparing for purchase of utility concessions.  All 
while developing strategy, building and organizing teams to execute the work, 
and seeing to it that the job got done.

Three documents are attached.  I suggest this order to read them: 
#1 "JPO Res Addendum" gives you a view looking forward (where I'll go, what I 
can do) as all resumes should.
#2 "JPO Res Exec Summ" gives you a view looking back (where I've been, what 
I've done) as all resumes would.
#3 "JPO Res Full CV" gives detail on specific assignments and projects 
(essentially an expanded version of #2).

Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for all.

Best regards,

J. Paul

We are hoping to release by 9am central time today - Thursday.

Thanks.

Look at the attached ... it may be too late for this afternoon, but I took a 
shot at a revised way of presenting the investment fund and the associated 
issues (substitute for slides 15-17?)

I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input 
will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of 
required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you 
know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how 
is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do 
about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to 
make these assessments.

I have reviewed the most recent IM and don't have any significant comments, 
but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of 
eyes(internally) who understand the regulatory overlay of the Southern Cone 
better and who are also in a better position  ( physically and with language 
skills ) to assess the  nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to 
effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take 
shape- With all of that in mind, I would recommend we , at the very least, 
bring Jose into the loop. I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I 
can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I 
would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the 
governmental approval stage-  being proactive now by bringing Jose over the 
wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.

Ken and Jeff have decided that the Enron Executive Committee Retreat will 
include only the Corporate Policy Committee this year.  (See list of members 
below.)  You may be holding the timeframe of January 16-18, 2001 on your 
calendar, which you can now free up if you are not on the committee.

The location of the retreat is under consideration.  When a decision is made, 
we will get the information to the members of the Corporate Policy 
Committee.  Departure for the retreat will be early afternoon on Tuesday, 
January 16 with return to Houston late afternoon on Thursday, January 18.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions at 713-853-6088.

key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, 
rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who 
are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also 
interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of 
these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by 
his vision for a new approach to the energy business.

Hi Steve,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like 'a listing of key members of ENA, particularly Skilling's early 
hires.'  

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey

I thought I would let you know that tonight on the Jim Lehrer Newshour on PBS 
they had a lengthy segment on California power prices.  While I took issue 
with some elements of the story, on balance it was one of the more calm and 
rational stories on the issue I have seen.  It might be worth obtaining a 
transcript to review.

Attention: MR.  STEVE  KEAN
  MS.  CINDY  OLSON    =20

Dear Mr. Kean and Ms. Olson:

I am privileged and delighted for providing me with this opportunity of=20
writing directly to both of you, while I am on re-deployment status.

The purpose of this letter is to respectfully appeal to both of you to plea=
se=20
help me continue serving Enron and continue being an active manager within=
=20
this most challenging environment, as I feel I am most qualified.

I joined Enron EE&CC on March 1, 2000; now am an EES employee. I am a=20
Mechanical Engineer, with 32 years work experience and extraordinary track=
=20
record in the oil & gas and power generation EPC business worldwide, with=
=20
major global organizations. =20

I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specifically in the Gas Turbines=
=20
Technology). I have been a Project Manager, Senior Project Manager, and=20
Project Director on major multi-million Dollar onshore and offshore=20
development projects since 1980, in every hydrocarbons  producing region.

I was interviewed at Enron=01,s EE&CC in mid February 2000 pursuant to my=
=20
application for Project Manager/Senior Project Manager position. =20

I was then hired on March 1, 2000 as Project Engineering Manager (PEM), und=
er=20
quite urgent circumstances, to be in charge of all three (3) major and most=
=20
active Power Projects at EE&CC in Brazil.  Just one (1) week later, after m=
y=20
new hires orientation, I had to join a delegation and travel to Brazil for=
=20
Due Diligence of Local Engineering and Construction Contractors. =20

The Expected NTP was January 2001, and the life of these foreign Projects=
=20
(except for Electrobolt =01) simple cycle plant) is three (3) to four (4) y=
ears,=20
i.e. until the year 2003 and 2004.  These Projects are RioGen, Cuiaba II, a=
nd=20
Electrobolt.

I was attracted to Enron due to its standing and recognition in the industr=
y,=20
reputation, globalization, and active market penetration.  In fact, I felt=
=20
very fortunate to become the center of the above-mentioned challenges with=
=20
three such major Enron Power Projects.

I resigned my then current and very secure position as Senior Project Manag=
er=20
at Solar Turbines Incorporated (a Caterpillar company), after almost 6=20
successful years, where I was entrusted with Solar=01,s major turnkey power=
 and=20
gas compression projects, worldwide.=20

My prime objective and priority then, when I accepted to work for Enron wer=
e,=20
clearly, to tackle and continue with the new challenges that Enron offered =
me=20
until the year 2003 =01) 2004. =20

However, I am still very optimistic and hopeful that, with your kind suppor=
t,=20
I am hoping to receive due consideration of this appeal.

I have already interviewed with Messrs. Steve Meyers and Dave Roberts at EE=
S,=20
and both believe that they are certainly in need of a strong technical pers=

like myself, but no confirmation has been received yet.

I have also applied to at least fifteen (15) pertinent positions within EES=

ENA, and Enron Transportation but, unfortunately, have received no response=
=20
yet.

Nevertheless, I am most certain that you do not want to loose a knowledgeab=

The Enron Corporate Policy Committee has been invited to attend the Tuesday, 
December 12th Board meeting. The meeting begins in Executive Session, a 
closed session, involving the Board members at 8:00 a.m. Following the 
Executive Session, the Corporate Policy Committee will be asked to join the 
Open Session beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Since we are never sure of 
the exact length of the Executive Session, we request that, if you are

Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=
,=20
a big part of the problem is a "dysfunctional market" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must "behave responsibly".
Everyone must "share the pain".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=
ve=20
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=
=20
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=
=20
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=
=20
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=
=20
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=
on=20

staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=
t=20
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=
nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=
te=20
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a "share the pain" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=
e=20
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=
=20
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=
=20
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=
=20
problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=
=20

prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)=
=20
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=

(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps=

I believe that Steve has been won over only for political (as in corporate
politics) reasons but once he gets in the voting booth, he's still with you
and Melissa.

Thanks- you got it about right .....except that Kean's Democratic
credentials are seriously in question these days as are his " liberal-
minded" credentials. You may have won over an individual  who can now
clearly  be categorized as a lost soul.

steve and rick-
mark halperin is the political director at abc -- the smart guy sitting to
peter jennings's right all night on election night who knew everything. his
brother is a speechwriter at the nsc. you'll see below his recommendation
of
mark katz and his number.

i also emailed peggy noonan to ask for any ideas. haven't heard from her
yet. she's been very busy writing some of the more brilliant commentary on
the current situation which i'm sure hasn't been allowed into the shapiro
empire.

speaking of stock prices, what the hell happened yesterday? i'm still a
stock holder (very small) so pass my bitches along to koenig.

what do you mean 'on principle'? there couldn't be a better issue for a
clinonista to stand for than busting up monopolies' hold on the little
people. actually enron's government affairs office is run by a bunch of
democrats and they just hired summer's  congressional person at treasury to
run their d.c. office. is your brother still at the nsc?

katz is the person i was thinking of. i'll pass his name along. thanks.

after re-reading your original email (the first words of which were that i
should share it with sam and gma) i felt a little less bad on my own....it
was still dumb...and our secret is safe..keep sending them

by brother is very funny...i'm not sure he would do it on principle...but i
can ask...the person to ask is mark katz...who wrote for clinton and
gore...very funny..very automatic...use my name...let me know if there is a
problem  212-496-7013
your level of apologizing was not necessary but after re-reading my initial
email i can see where you could be mistaken that i was upset. i'm not. i
just don't want to break one of the only flows of insider information that
i
have left -- even if it's into a has-been.

but while i have you gravelling, you could do something for me. i just got
a
call from my old boss at enron and he is looking to hire someone as a
consultant who specializes in humor writing. they want to try a humorous
approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation. do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been
responsible for some of the president's humorous speeches? or anyone that
fits this bill? what about your brother? it seems like i read a profile of
one of them recently who was leaving. the only republican i can think of is
landon parvin who has been around forever.

two people here did stupid things (first me, by in a hurry giving
instructions to my colleague about what to do with the information;then my
colleague for sending it to somebody untrustworthy)

so: i apologize...being in a hurry is no excuse for being careless.....

here's the silver linings:

1. gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day, so from
there point of view, they aren't focused on where it came from
2. there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
3. i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again, and won't let even one person have access to
emails/information from you...the person in this case doesn't know it came
from you (or jb for that matter, since i had already taken her name and
your
name off of it)

again, i'm sorry.....i have zero tolerance for such carelessness, and
pleading being overwhelmed with work on the story is no excuse

ps: i hope you saw jamie's interview...it was priceless

when i said 'pass along', i only meant the information, not the entire
email. i'm not going to fess up if you and everyone else who has it doesn't
reveal their source.
Everyone at ABC has a copy of the last e-mail I sent everyone concerning
President Bush's appearances on the morning shows tomorrow.

We have a leak.

I suspect someone in total innocence is forwarding my e-mails to friends
and
family, etc.  I need for all of you to take a very careful look at your
forwarding lists and think about where this leak might be.  If you think
you
know where the leak is, please, please let me know.

If we can't find it, these e-mails will cease and desist.

Jean

P.S. In case you were wondering, yeah, ABC is not happy.

do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related 
to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of 
the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution.  
We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a 
filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail?

Steve,   As we just discussed, this is the transition memo suggesting that  
you place a call to Clay Johnson.   As noted in the memo, we are still 
working through with the lawyers what leave status our employees would be 
required to take while serving on the private transition and the publicly 
funded transition.  The answer to this question may determine their 
willingness to serve, in some cases.  

I have been trying to hook up with Kevin and will see him tomorrow.  I still 
prefer to use the "old exec committee plus" for this PRC with a reformed MD 
PRC starting at mid year.  We have too many people in transition to just 
switch over to the policy committee at this stage.

Following discussions with Steve and Kevin yesterday, we're providing some 
options for the conduct of final PRC reviews  for the Enron VP's and MD's.  
Please let us know which of these options (or a derivative therein) you'd 
prefer.  

For continuity through the year-end process, we might consider having the 
existing MD VP PRC Committee review the VP slate; and  the former EC and two 
newly appointed EC members  who are also VP PRC Committee, (John  Lavorato 
and Jeff Shankman were suggested), ratify the VP slate and review the 
MD's.    The newly appointed EC members who are MD level will remain in the 
"Not Rated" category, so that Jeff and John may participate in the overall 
discussion and depart before discussions relative to them and their EC 
colleagues.      

Alternatively, we might disband the existing MD VP PRC Committee in favor of 
having the newly appointed EC  (13  of whom are MD VP PRC) review the VP 
slate.  Thereafter, the Enron Corporate Policy Committee would be responsible 
for ratifying these results and for reviewing the MD's slate.  Insofar as the 
Policy Committee might require further  information on individual MD's, 
selected EC members could be invited for an appropriate period of time to 
provide the necessary details.   

If we opt to disband the existing MD VP PRC we'd need to notify those members 
who aren't part of the new EC that their services are no longer required.  In 
so much as some of these people are currently assigned to, and attending, BU 
and functional pre-rankings clearly the sooner we are able to do this, the 
better.

Your immediate attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated, since we 
are eager to begin the year-end VP/MD PRC planning process.  Thanks in 
advance,

Gina Corteselli

Talking points from Steve's discussion with Ken;  do not circulate.

Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to 
power and gas pricing, particularly in California.  Included are a detailed 
set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in 
California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary 
designed for more general audiences and the media.  The gas paper was 
prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.  I 
will get a more integrated message put together and circulated.

   

   

I agree that we need to rework the copy, especially since the gas market is 
blowing up.

In the first sentence could we say "transmission owning market participant".

See my changes included in footnote below.

Christi-  this is how I changed the footnote.  Is it ok?  Let me know before 
I fax it.

The "Hub & Spoke" analysis is an appropriate method for determining the 
ability of a market participant to exercise market power in transmission.  
Market based rate applications for transmission-owning utilities merit the 
same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications, i.e., a 
competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral 
analysis whenever the screen reveals potential market power.  Modernizing 
this type of market power analysis required with market based rate 
applications is of equal importance to that of improving the analysis for 
merger applications, as recognized by the Commission in its recent Filing 
Requirements Rulemaking, Order No. 642, Revised Filing Requirements Under 
Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations, 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,164, 65 Fed. Reg. 
70,983 (Nov. 28, 2000); see also Sithe Edgar L.L.C., 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,193

I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until 
we have legal (including FCPA) approval.  I have exchanged voicemails with 
Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.  If you have consulted local 
counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth.
Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later 
(as we have in other cases).

This issue has come up before in Europe.  The first time through is the  
hardest and slowest.  After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent 
requests move faster.  But we have to get it right.  Even in Europe, where 
our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention 
just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in 
Europe -- even where other American companies don't).

Steve, the purpose of this note is to get your sign off on attending a 
cocktail function to be held by a senior Japanese political figure this 
evening. Timing for approval is at issue.

We have been invited by Mr Kamei a senior political figure in the LDP to 
attend a cocktail party this evening. The price is Y20,000 (about $190) per 
head and we were proposing to send two people. My rough estimate is that half 
of each ticket would go to the LDP ie a total of $190. We have been 
developing a good relationship with the LDP through Kamei and most recently, 
he assisted us in arranging a meeting for Ken Lay with the MITI minister. 
Accordingly the purpose of attending is to maintain good relations with the 
Japanese Government with a view assisting to further Enron Japan's business 
interests in Japan. It would be viewed negatively if we were not to attend.  

We have external legal counsel sign-off that this type of function is legal 
in Japan. The function also has the support of Joe Hirl. I am aware that 
there is a procedure for political donations, however, given the number of 
Enron hands that the application needs to pass through, we will not have 
approval in time for this evening. Hence this note.

Through the course of today, I will seek to get the application approved 
through Mark Schroeder and John Sherriff and on its way to  Elizabeth 
Labanowski and then to you. As mentioned, Elizabeth is unlikely to get the 
application until after the function this evening. In the meantime, I would 
be grateful if you read this email this evening if I could have your 
preliminary OK.

kind regards

I have also received regrets from Horton, but confirmation from Metts

comments back to me by noon on Thurs., December 7.  Call me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or 
move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people 
who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind 
(Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the 
company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's 
hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of 
interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done 
much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in 
the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.

Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, 
or find him something through the redeployment process?

Per a conversation with Steve Kean, I am forwarding a copy of my resume for 
your review.  Since coming to Enron, I have desired an opportunity in our 
Government / Regulatory Affairs area.  While here, I have been involved in 
the commercial end of the business; primarily on the international side and 
now in EBS.  I would like to discuss possible opportunities with you as soon 
as possible.

Thanks for your consideration.

       Power sector restructuring: international activity, June - November
       2000

      This  mailing is a periodic update of the status of international
      electric power sector privatization and restructuring.

      Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace.
      Governments faced with burgeoning power demands, but lacking the
      funds to meet them, are nearly universally opening their generation
      markets to foreign investors, even where privatization is not on the
      agenda.  More and more, state-owned utilities are unbundling.
      Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the
      wholesale and retail levels.  A few international players have scaled
      back their international investments and shifted substantial portions
      of their portfolio to less risky markets, such as the U.S. or Europe.
      Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive.  As Asian
      economies recover, most governments are starting to move forward
      again with unbundling / restructuring plans.  After a year in which
      currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit
      Latin America, a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to
      restart, but at a slower pace.

      This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific,
      Latin America, and the Middle East / Africa. Maps that summarize the
      status of restructuring in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa
      and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits 1-4.  A slippery slope
      is Exhibit 5.  Timelines showing the opening of markets in various
      countries, by region, are in Exhibits 6-8.

      (See attached file: Intlmail 3 exhibits.ppt)

      February '99 marked the opening of the market to choice for most
      large EU customers who use over 40 GWh a year.  This accounts for
      about a fourth of demand.  As of "E-Day", neither France nor Italy
      had passed their proposed enabling legislation.  While the EU
      intended for the transmission operator to be independent, EDF intends
      to retain control over the grid, as will ENEL.  A phased deregulation
      of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in
      August 2000.

      Mergers, alliances, and consolidation are a dominant theme as
      companies jockey for position in the new European power market.
      There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross
      borders: as suppliers of new generation, as purchasers of assets
      being spun off by liberalization decrees (Italy) or because of market
      concentration rulings in mergers (Germany, Spain). Several
      international companies have opened trading offices in Europe, or  (
      Enron, Reliant, Southern, TXU).  HoustonStreet.com launched a
      European online wholesale energy-trading platform.

           ?  Austria:  Austria's liberalizing market is facing problems
              from within and without.  The EU is dissatisfied with its
              lack of G-T-D unbundling, although accounts were formally
              separated in 1999.  There is no ISO.  Internally, there is
              intense discussion about an accelerated market opening
              (customers over 20 GWh now have choice). Regional utilities
              are angry over the Verbund's proposal to open 100% of the
              market in late 2001. The Verbund, a 51% SOU, is the largest
              generator and owns the transmission grid. However, it has no
              retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already
              deregulated wholesale customers. (C.B. White, Judith Lezaun)

           ?  Denmark: The 1999 liberalization law exceeds the EU
              directive's goals and establishes full retail access by 2003.
              Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than
              100 GWh in 1997;  the threshold dropped in April '00 more
              than 10 GWh; the next threshold drops to 1GWh at the end of
              2000. The new law includes unbundling of distribution
              activity and regulated TPA. Denmark has recently experienced
              a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector
              with 2 large incumbents. The trend is moving downstream into
              distribution and supply. Western Denmark is already part of
              the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to
              join by the end of 2000. Energy policy aims at twenty percent
              of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of
              2003, up from a current 10%. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Finland: Finland has been fully open to choice since
              September 1998, when a metering requirement was dropped.
              Prices immediately dropped, but only about 2-3% of households
              have switched supplier. Finland forms part of the Nordic
              power exchange NordPool. The regulator monitors distribution
              tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place. In November '98, the
              Finnish government launched an IPO for 20% of Fortum, the
              holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy
              and oil and gas company Neste Oy. The Finnish government
              expects to lower its ownership further. The largest new
              entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall, with its
              acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity.
              Further M&A in the distribution and supply sector is
              expected. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  France: There was irony in France's push for liberalization
              as it assumed its six-month EU presidency.    France passed
              its electricity law last February, a year after required by
              EU directive, but had 30-odd implementation decrees stalled
              in the National Assembly.  However, EDF, which still controls
              more than 95% of French generation, realized Brussels would
              hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained
              closed. It recently convinced French authorities to open up
              34% of the market by the end of 2000 instead of 2003,
              lowering the eligibility threshold to 9 GWh/year (from 16
              GWh). EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from
              easily entering the energy services market  -- leading EDF to
              promote a "relatively rapid" total opening of the French
              market. (Corinne Aigroz, White)

           ?   Germany:  While the Electricity Law was officially effective
              in April '98, real competition is still impeded by
              complicated TPA grid access conditions, especially on the
              retail market. A group of new entrants has organized to call
              for a governmental regulator.  Some recent studies have shown
              the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a
              "massive cross-subsidization between network operations and
              marketing." Recent charges have been made of obstacles to
              competition by a mulitiplicity of fees, including customer
              switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies.
              In the last 12 months, M&A among big national and
              international utilities has redrawn the German utility
              landscape: EDF bought a share in EnBW, Veba / Viag merged to
              form EON and RWE/VEW merged into RWE. Furthermore, RWE and
              EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust
              authority.  Currently, several utilities are and battling for
              control of East German VEAG, whose transmission connections
              make it a portal to Eastern Europe.  (Judith Lezaun, White)

           ?  Greece: According to the FT, Greece has "hired a consultant"
              (us) to produce a 5-year plan for state utility PPC.  PPC is
              preparing an IPO for 15-20% of the company, theoretically set
              for 2001, but likely later.  Greece has been given until 2001
              by the EU to conform to the Directive. An IEA report
              suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector
              structure.  First, the government should create a clearer
              separation between itself and the state-owned PPC, including
              a separate regulatory agency.  Second, the government should
              consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to
              maximize competition, as well as improving market access
              conditions for IPPs and cogenerators.  As the country's
              largest employer, PPC is not likely to effect these changes
              quickly. (White, Thomas Read)

           ?  Ireland: Supply competition was introduced in February '00
              for customers over 4 GWh (28% of the market).  Opening is
              scheduled to increase to 32% in 2003, with further
              liberalisation in 2006.  No date for mid-market and full
              retail opening has been set.   Incumbent ESB plans to split
              off its transmission business, which will remain state-owned.
              Competition in generation will be introduced in 2002 with the
              auctioning of ESB capacity, which is intended to create at
              least two new players.  Independent power production has been
              allowed for two years now. (Ben Joyce)

           ?  Italy:  Italy approved its market deregulation decree in
              March '99; in some measures, it goes beyond the EU Directive.
              ENEL had dominated 80% of generation; by 2003, no entity can
              control more than 50%, or 30% by 2005.  This requires that
              ENEL sell between 15GW and 22GW of its 57GW by 2003.  It has
              separated G-T-D into separate legal entities and been 34.5%
              privatized.  A second tranche should take place in 2001.  A
              pool mechanism should be operating by 2001.  Consortia of
              industrials using more 30GWh/year can contract directly with
              IPPs; by 2002, the threshold will be 9GWh/ year. The
              potential free market currently amounts to 80 TWh a year, or
              30% of total demand.  This will increase to 40% in 2002.
              ENEL, who has a de facto monopoly on T&D, will retain
              ownership of the national grid assets; a separate state-run
              ISO, GRTN, will run transmission and dispatching.  A pool
              mechanism, operated by a GRTN subsidiary, should be operating
              by 2001; in the meantime, the market uses bilateral
              contracts. (Valentina Grifo, White)

           ?  Netherlands:  By June '00 three of the four large generation
              companies had been sold to foreign energy groups.
              Competition for large industrial users began in August '98.
              Large industrials (33% of the market) can currently choose
              their supplier.  By 2002, 58% of the market will be
              competitive, and in 2004, there will be full customer choice.
              The Amsterdam Power Exchange, modeled along Scandinavian
              lines, was launched in May '99.  The APX allows players to
              trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next
              day.  In April '00, it added day-ahead prices at border
              points for Germany, although it is not yet much used; if
              successful, Belgium would follow. In October '00, the
              government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network,
              TenneT, from the four generation companies for $99.1 million.
              Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase
              real competition. (White, Karel Tutein Nolthenius)

           ?  Norway:  Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop
              in 1991. "Real" retail access got started in 1995 when the
              meter requirement was abolished; switching got started in
              1997 when a switching fee was canceled.  The current
              accumulated switching rate lies at 14%. Distribution tariffs
              are regulated and transparent according to rTPA. Norway forms
              part of NordPool. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Portugal: Portugal brought new regulations into force in
              January '99.  They include a price-cap system for determining
              tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems:
              public and independent.  Each is locked into supplying the
              national grid (REN), a regulated and EdP-owned monopoly.
              Producers within the independent system can currently supply
              eligible customers who consume more than 9GWh/year at a
              single site.  The country's four discos may purchase up to 8%
              of consumption outside the public system.  Portugal's
              regulator, ERSE, needs either to extend the eligible
              customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to
              reach the percents required by the Directive.  The government
              sold another stake of 20% of state-owned Electricidade de
              Portugal in October '00, following two successful offerings
              in '97 and '98.   This offering raised $1.34 billion.  The
              state retains 32.6% and "golden share" voting rights. (Rui de
              Sousa)

           ?  Spain: After several major Latin American purchases, Endesa
              moved to restructure and consolidate at home, announcing in
              October '00 the merger with Iberdrola.  The resulting company
              would have 80% of the market, so it would be forced to shed
              generation and distribution assets.  It would also create the
              world's 4th largest utility, by market cap. There is also
              movement with the smaller two players.

              The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule
              faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive
              providing for full market opening by January 2003. Several
              foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible
              consumers and there are new generation capacity additions
              announced by some of the large international. Nearly 60% of
              the market can now choose its supplier.  A mandatory pool
              with a bidding system started in Jan '98. (White, Dominguez)

           ?   Sweden: Deregulation was introduced in January '96 with full
              retail access to all customer groups, rTPA and unbundling of
              distribution activities. However, switching was impeded by a
              meter requirement that was abolished in November '99.
              Switching is currently at 10% but with renegotiated contracts
              the figure is more like 25%. Sweden forms part of NordPool, a
              "common electricity market", a forum for physical and
              financial exchanges. Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market
              and an OTC market for financial trading. Consolidation has
              occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation
              market is concentrated in the hands of 3 large actors.
              (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Switzerland: In October '00, Parliament passed an electricity
              market law.  The first phase of the liberalization should
              start in 2001 granting choice to large industrials (> 20
              GWh); the mid-size market will open in 2004 (> 10 GWh). In
              2007, the law envisions a fully open market. Some aspects of
              the new law, such as the transmission tariff model, are still
              being discussed. (Chris Brombacher, White)

           ?  UK: With market deregulation complete (full choice since May
              1999), the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply
              consolidation.  Seven of the 12 RECs in England & Wales are
              now in joint ownership.  In the generation market, the
              incumbent's share continues to decline: National Power and
              PowerGen have divested further capacity, and now stand at
              8.5% and 6.7%.

              The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have
              been postponed to early 2001.  They will allow for a futures
              and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot
              market.  Markets will be run by independent members, although
              the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a
              system operator as before.  A bilateral power exchange will
              also be put in, and is expected to handle a much larger
              demand than the spot market. (Ben Joyce)

      In Central and Eastern Europe, privatization initiatives are
      continuing to attract badly needed capital, while the IMF urges
      reforms as a condition for funding.  Countries that are looking to EU
      membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and
      gradual opening of their markets to choice.

           ?  Bulgaria: In January, the Energy Agency announced its intent
              to unbundle the state monopoly, NEK, into separate G-T-D
              companies.  NEK will remain a single buyer; 28 distribution
              entities have been merged into seven new companies.  The
              unions are opposing rapid reform, claiming the necessary
              regulations have not yet been written.  The government is
              working with the IMF to set up financial controls and
              eliminate cross-subsidies.  Between 2001 and 2005, all
              generation will be upgraded or privatized.  Transmission will
              remain state-owned.  (Csilla Ilkei, White)

           ?  The Czech Republic: In October '00, the Czech government
              announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ
              and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single
              buyer. Privatization is expected to begin in 2001.  Many
              Western companies, such as Vattenfall and E.On have already
              been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors
              who need the cash to balance their budgets. A new energy law
              should be also approved by the end of 2000, which would open
              power markets to competition between 2002 and 2006; prices
              should reflect costs by 2002.  Gas liberalization will follow
              in 2005.  CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant,
              Temelin, which should begin operating by spring 2001. CEZ
              plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by 20% after the
              commercial launch of Temelin. (Kristina Kalinova, White)

           ?  Hungary: Since December '95, majority shares have been sold
              in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western
              investors.   Eastern Europe's  earliest and most ambitious
              privatization program has fallen victim to a host of
              problems, especially central government price control.  AES
              and IVO-Tomen tendered new capacity tendered in 1999, but AES
              is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign
              its agreed-on PPA.   Hungary will partially deregulate its
              market after 2002 but before it joins the EU. Further
              privatization opportunities include a coal-fired power plant
              as well as the monopoly transco, MVM. (Cs. Ilkei, White)

           ?  Moldova: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
              has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of
              Modova, giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost.
              Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution
              companies, then in three generators. The first attempt to
              privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids.  All
              companies will require substantial investment for upgrades.
              (White)

           ?  Romania: In September '00, the national electric company,
              Conel, was split into four independent units. These encompass
              fossil generation, hydro generation, transmission, and
              distribution and metering. Restructuring precedes eventual
              privatization, which will begin with distribution, followed
              by generation.  Current law requires foreign owners to have a
              local partner.  As Romania is one of the countries invited to
              join accession talks with the EU, it is opening its market in
              stages.  Currently, 10% (>100GWh) has choice; this will rise
              to 45% (>40GWh) next year.  Evenually, elegibility thresholds
              will be lowered to 20GWh, then 9GWh. (Cs. Ilkei,White)

           ?  Russia: In the mid-1990s, the Unified Energy Systems of
              Russia Joint Stock Company (UES; also known as RAO), was
              organized into 72 regional joint stock companies; UES still
              holds 49% shares in most of these regional utilities.  In May
              '00, President Putin fired the non-reformist energy minister
              who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and
              liberalization.  The new minister is an unknown quantity.
              The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions
              of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls, currently at
              25%. (White)

           ?  Slovak Republic: In October 2000 the government approved a
              plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy
              sector; implementation legislation needs to be passed.  The
              plan would see state-owned Slovenske Elektrarne (the G-T-D
              monopoly) transformed into a 100% state-owned joint stock
              company.   Regional distributors will be separated from SE
              and merged in the first half of 2001 into three joint-stock
              companies, with a 49% block of shares to be sold.  Generation
              will also be separated and transformed into joint stock
              companies. Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the
              heating plants.  The government will select a privatization
              adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early
              2001. (Kristina Kalinova)

           ?  Turkey: The controversy over BOO (build-own-operate) vs. BOT
              (build-operate-transfer) arrangements for IPPs was resolved
              in January 2000.  Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional
              amendment allowing international arbitration for energy
              contracts.  Twenty-three BOT projects are affected.  Turkish
              economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to
              64 GW by 2010.  In September, Turkey proposed an energy law
              that would separate state-owned TEAS into separate G-T-D
              entities.  Generation plants would eventually be available
              for privatization, while new plants would no longer be
              transferred to the government, but remain with the IPP
              builder.  The impetus for this proposed law is Turkey's
              interest in EU membership; only 1/8th of its 120 energy
              regulations meets EU standards.  (White)

           ?  Ukraine:  Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the
              country's 27 regional discos, in a transparent tender.   Such
              a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before.  Each sale will
              be for 25% plus one share. The distribution sector is beset
              with a host of problems including high non-payment, unpaid
              employees, and corruption.  The EBRD is pushing for progress
              on privatization before it provides funds to build an
              alternative to Chernobyl, which the authorities have agreed
              to close.

      Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some
      countries electricity demand is returning to pre-crisis levels.  Most
      governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling /
      restructuring plans in the power sector; although IPPs are facing
      ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees.

           ?  Australia:  All customers in Australia should have choice by
              2003.  Victoria will to phase in full competition during
              2001.  New South Wales (NSW) has delayed full competition for
              residential users and small businesses to January '02.  The
              five other states plan to phase in full choice by 2003.
              Victoria's five distributors are facing revenue reductions of
              between 12% and 22% starting in 2001, whey they say will hurt
              their service capability.  Recent M&A activity has seen
              already- privatized Victorian distribution, retail, and
              transmission change hands, with new owners coming from Asia.
              ElectraNet, South Australia's (SA) transco, was sold as a
              200-year lease in September.  The National Electricity
              Market, comprising Victoria and NSW, started operating in
              December '99.  Queensland, SA and ACT will join in the next
              few years.

           ?  China:  China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,
              including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased
              interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai
              provinces.  As there is no process or body in place to
              oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere
              slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs
              following a government decision to cap the ROR for new
              projects at 10%.  Another issue is lack of government
              guarantees.  China plans to build hundreds of small rural
              hydro projects and to spend Yn55bn to upgrade rural power
              grids in 2000 as part of a project to bring electricity to 75
              million people who currently have no access.

           ?  India:  Five of India's 19 states have undertaken significant
              reforms: Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
              Uttar Pradesh.  And, only four of the State Electricity
              Boards (SEBs), the principal buyers for independent power,
              are profitable.  IPP builders have been frustrated by a host
              of regulations, lack of guarantees, and SEB insolvencies.
              The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted
              this year by the withdrawal of two major investors, EdF and
              Cogentrix.
              A draft "Electricity Bill 2000" will be introduced in
              Parliament this winter.  It would create and empower
              autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions.  SEBs
              would be unbundled into G-T-D and corporatized within four
              months of passage.  Initially, states would initially retain
              G&D assets; they would later be privatized.  Transmission
              assets would be put under an independent authority, and TPA
              would be allowed.  Significantly, IPP licensing requirements
              would be clarified and reduced, and largely eliminated for
              the growing segment of captive producers.  A key problem of
              theft ? as high as 30% of T&D losses in some areas ? would be
              addressed by strict metering and high penalties.  The
              likelihood, however, of the Bill being passed as proposed is
              not strong, as it faces significant opposition both by unions
              and regional parties in Parliament.

           ?  Indonesia:  Indonesia's IPP program has faced problems over
              power purchase costs and project rates of return, with
              bankrupt state-owned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP
              operators for power.  Of 27 planned IPP projects, only three
              now supply power; six others are ready to generate.  PLN
              reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which
              Paiton will supply energy for 10 months, at a rate said to be
              much lower than the original agreed-upon price.  Other PPA
              renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss
              until the Indonesian economy revives and PLN's financial
              situation improves.  Unbundling is underway on Java/Bali,
              where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries.  Outside
              Java/Bali, unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines.
              The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting
              to develop rules for a competitive market.

           ?  Japan:  On March 21, 8000 large customers (30% of the market)
              were allowed to choose a supplier.  This broke the monopolies
              of the ten regional IOUs for the first time, but high
              transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting
              true competition. Newer liberalization measures in the
              electricity and gas sectors have since been written --  an
              agreement was signed at the July G8 Summit which provides for
              fair and transparent non-discriminatory access to
              distribution networks in both sectors.  A number of new
              companies are entering (or planning to enter) the market,
              largely set up as JVs with local non-incumbents, often
              offering new products and services.
              In August the government awarded a tender to a non-utility,
              Diamond Power, a Mitsubishi unit, to supply electricity to
              the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate 4% lower than
              incumbent TEPCO's.  TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant
              to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in
              the face of increased competition.

           ?  Malaysia:  Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman
              of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in July.  He assured
              investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his
              predecessor would remain intact.  TNB will be transformed
              into two separate T&D companies by 2003, with an equity
              interest in generation.  Generation assets have already been
              separated into TNB Generation; thermal generation will be
              sold.   The government has approved the construction of more
              IPPs to meet the demand for electricity, which has grown 12%
              compared to the period before the economic crisis.  Work on
              the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed, but it
              remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as
              originally planned or on a smaller scale.

           ?  New Zealand: 1999 saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create
              further competition  -- Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, and
              Mighty River Power.  They have been corporatized but will
              remain under government ownership.  Legislation passed in
              1999 forbade ownership of wires (non-competitive) and
              generation and retailing (competitive) by the same company.
              Companies have until 2004 either to sell one business type or
              to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they
              do not wish to keep. By February '00, most had implemented
              full separation.  The newly merged (75.8%) NGC/TransAlta will
              be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand, with a market
              cap of NZ$2.1billion and more than 650,000 customers.

           ?  Pakistan:  Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated
              PPAs which allow fixed ROR of 12%, but IPPs face continued
              lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties.
              Problems continue over Hub Power Company (Hubco), the largest
              IPP project in Pakistan.  Hubco is receiving significantly
              lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted.  The
              government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA
              was amended in the 1990's, making the wholesale power tariff
              untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco.
              More than 20% of plants have already been sold in a phased
              sell-off of WAPDA's generation.  Eight parties have been
              short-listed for the pending privatization of 51% of Karachi
              Electric Supply Commission, but the sale has been often
              delayed.

           ?  Philippines:   An Omnibus Electricity Bill, which will set
              the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor,
              is stalled in a House-Senate reconciliation committee.  The
              Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all
              financial assistance, including $100million in loans for
              power related projects, until the legislation is passed.
              Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department
              officials are looking at several alternate options for
              selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill.
              Government-appointed advisers have also recommended that
              Napocor renegotiate some of its take-or-pay contracts with
              IPPs, asking some IPPs to reduce power off-take on an interim
              basis.  Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these
              conditions a longer life span for their projects, but
              developers are reluctant to accept because of their own
              financial commitments.

           ?  Singapore:  Since initial restructuring and corporatization
              in 1995 and the establishment of a pool in 1998, Singapore
              has lagged in power sector deregulation.  Investors complain
              that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has
              yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for
              large consumers.  A thorough review in 1999 by the Ministry
              of Trade and Industry recommended that:  generation  be
              privatized, but with restrictions on generation
              cross-ownership; transmission and market operation functions
              be separated and an ISO established; and that most retail
              services be privatized.  The government has granted two
              public retail licenses, meaning that the two IPPs can sell
              electricity directly to large users.  Retail licenses are
              expected to be issued to the three power generators.  This
              will allow full competition for large industrial and
              commercial customers, but retail competition for smaller
              customers is unlikely to be in place before 2002.

           ?  South Korea: South Korea is proceeding with a major
              restructuring program, following government approval in July
              1999 for state-owned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos.
              KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco.  Each of
              the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea
              Stock Exchange; up to 30% foreign ownership will be
              permitted.  The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO, which
              will initially retain its T&D services.  Later, a UK-type
              pool will be established where all generators will sell into
              the pool. Competition in distribution and retailing is a
              long-term target.  IPP projects totaling 2,515MW are already
              in operation.  Impending restructuring has not deterred
              foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs.

           ?  Taiwan: Two phases of IPP development have been approved, but
              only one IPP scheme has started up.   Developers have faced
              land acquisition problems, causing IPP schedules to slip.  In
              1999, the government announced plans to launch Phase Three,
              limited to gas-fired plants.  An Electricity Act is before
              Parliament.  Its main provisions include: privatizing
              Taipower without unbundling G-T-D; allowing other companies
              to enter the market as either vertically integrated,
              generation, transmission or distribution companies and to pay
              Taipower a fee for using its facilities; and the creation of
              an independent regulator, especially for tariffs.  IPPs will
              be able to supply customers at 161kV and above, and IPP
              prices will not be regulated.

           ?  Thailand: The 1999 State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid
              out a three-stage process for all state-owned enterprises,
              including power, to create fully competitive, restructured
              and privatized sectors.  A draft Energy Act is under
              discussion, while preparation and implementation of various
              technical frameworks are underway. Under the Act, a
              competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in 2003,
              although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then.
              It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent
              and independent regulatory body. EGAT transferred two thermal
              units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October; EGAT also
              plans to corporatize and partially privatize its non-hydro
              plants by 2003.  Before the economic crisis, the government
              had an ambitious IPP program; EGAT now has excess capacity,
              so has delayed many projects.  Its long-term plans include
              the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants (SPPs)
              using renewable energy.  PPAs have been signed with 50 SSPs.

           ?  Vietnam: Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its
              power system. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is an unbundled
              state monopoly, which does not even service rural customers.
              Local villages provide services to small farmers and small
              commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards. The
              World Bank has approved a $150million credit to Vietnam to
              extend grid electricity to about 450,000 households scattered
              throughout the country.  A few IPPs are trying to win
              generation projects.   An Electricity Law due to be enacted
              in 2001 would establish a National Electricity Office for
              regulation.   This would replace the existing haphazard
              village-level regulatory system.

      Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations, many
      Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations.  At
      the same time, ownership limits imposed by several governments limit
      further investments by companies who have already entered the market.
      According to the Inter-American Development Bank, privatization of
      electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all
      of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of
      Venezuela and Mexico.  It estimates that 75 million Latin Americans
      are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer
      countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and some Central American countries.
      Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are
      beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to
      investments.  And for those who were already open, a new development
      is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either
      as concessions to build or as full privatizations.  A big factor
      impacting generation this year has been the region's heavy reliance
      on hydro-power.  Serious region-wide droughts during the last few
      years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors.

           ?  Argentina:  The big news is in Argentina transmission sector.
              This fall, Argentina auctioned off 25% of Transener in an
              IPO, while also offering six lines to the private sector on a
              B-O-M (build-operate-maintain) basis. Endesa (Spain) must
              divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to
              antitrust concerns  (Endesa's two companies are now serving
              40% of the countries 36 million people).  The regulator
              believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate
              efficiency and to set prices.

           ?  Brazil:   Brazil's wholesale energy market (WEM) began
              operating in October; initially, only 5-10% of power bought
              or sold will go through WEM.  As other contracts expire it
              will eventually supervise $15 billion worth of power.  The
              WEM intends also to create an internet-based trading system.
              The Brazilian system, 95% hydro-run, is dependent on
              plentiful rains to avoid shortages.   Demand growth has far
              outstripped GDP, while new generation is not keeping pace.
              Analysts predict a 15% shortage in 2001, with intermittent
              brownouts, while neighbors are building generation with an
              eye to exporting power to Brazil.
              Sao Paulo state will sell 38.6% of CESP Parana, one of the
              last large generation privatizations,  in December.  The
              state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any
              premium paid over the minimum price of R1.74 billion (US$
              901mil).  Brazil also conducted a successful action of three
              transmission lines in August on a build-operate basis.

           ?  Bolivia:  Ende, Bolivia's utility, was unbundled in '94 and
              has been successively sold off through capitalization (a 50%
              stake and management control).  To meet demand rising at 7.5%
              annually, the government has ordered these buyers to invest
              $296 million in the next three years or face losing their
              concessions; they have not fulfilled previous obligations in
              upgrades.   Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow
              distributors to generate up to 30% of demand instead of 15%.

           ?  Chile: Privatization in Chile is largely complete. Endesa's
              (Spain) controversial takeover of Enersis (Chile) will be the
              basis for its diversification into telecom, via its
              subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra.  Partially in response to
              Endesa's vertical dominance, partially in response to supply
              conditions engendered by prolonged drought, and partially to
              increase competition, Chile has proposed new regulation plans
              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.  Until now,
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators.  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for
              the 100% sale of Transelec in September.
              1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously
              affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of
              Chile's generation.  Under the existing system, generators
              had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.  Chile hopes
              the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to
              generation and to introduce competition into distribution,
              heretofore a monopoly.

           ?  Colombia: Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks
              against transmission installations have forced the government
              to postpone the sale of any further power assets, including
              Isagen, the state generator, ISA, the transco, as well as 14
              regional distributors. (A March attack, for instance, caused
              a blackout in 9 provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or
              more.)  The government claims to be reassessing the rules,
              but the reality is that the assets would not receive any
              decent offer now.  For now, 100- 300 million new shares
              (13.5% of capital) in ISA will be sold to the public at a 15%
              discount, to "democratize" the power sector. Since January
              '00, 90% of the market has had choice.

           ?  Cuba:  The first IPP began delivering power to Cuba's grid in
              October '98.  In order to curb programmed blackouts, it has
              invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new
              crude reserves.  Cuba hopes that 70% of its power will be
              generated from local fuels by year-end.

           ?  Dominican Republic: Blackouts still plague this nation a year
              after the government split state-owned CDE into separate
              G-T-D units.  Investors paid $750 for a 50% stake and
              management control of non-hydro generation and of
              distribution.  The new government is requiring IPPs (who
              provide 40% of the republic's power) to renegotiate the terms
              of the privatization contracts signed with the prior
              government.  In the hopes of increasing competition and
              lowering prices, the gencos are planning a power
              clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to T&D
              companies.  It will, however, "only function when there is
              adequate electricity to meet demand."

           ?  Ecuador: The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale
              of its power sector.  There is a current investment limit of
              39%, which may need to be raised to 51%.  The government
              realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization
              in order to attract capital.  Its largest utility, EMELEC,
              will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive
              debts.

           ?  El Salvador: In October, AES bought Reliant's interest in
              three discos (privatized in 1998), which together serve 60%
              of the population.  CEL, the SOU, does not plan to privatize
              its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment.

           ?  Guatemala:  Guatemala sold two major discos in 1998;
              investors have made significant system upgrades.  State
              utility INDE still owns 45% of the country's generation, all
              in hydro.  It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early 90s
              with take-or-pay PPAs; IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid
              access.  The power sector, while needing new investment for
              the next five years, may soon be in trouble due to currency
              devaluation, high fuel costs, and the effect of the PPAs.
              Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing
              regulations to their 1997 law to encourage more investment.

           ?  Jamaica:  For the second time in four years, the Jamaican
              government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC, which
              handles all of T&D and 75% of the island's generation.  And,
              for the second time, it is Southern who is in the forefront
              of privatization negotiations.  It is still not clear what
              percent will be sold, but it seems likely to be a marginal
              minority of 45%, without G-T-D first being spun-off.

           ?  Mexico: The new Fox administration plans to revive
              electricity reform, tabled last year, without which energy
              cannot keep pace with economic growth.  Fox says there will
              be no privatizations, but an opening of the market.  Private
              participation in the distribution sector would require a
              constitutional change.  Many believe that constitutional
              change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms.
              Mexico estimates it needs investments of $25 billion in the
              power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand;
              reserve margins are at 6%, while consumption is growing at 6%
              - 8% annually.  Without a clear regulatory bill opening the
              market to competition, investment is inhibited.  IPPs have
              heretofore been built on a B-O-O basis.  Recent tenders have
              included the option to build either in the U.S. or Mexico,
              with power dedicated to Mexico.

           ?  Nicaragua:   The privatization of state-owned power company
              (ENEL) is underway, following its restructuring.  Assets were
              first split into G-T-D companies.  In September '00, Spain's
              Union Fenosa acquired 95% of two discos for $115 million in
              an auction in which it was the sole bidder. High oil prices
              forced the government to postpone the October sale of the
              three gencos; two of the three pre-qualified companies failed
              to submit final bids.  Also, the political opposition has
              challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme
              Court.

           ?  Panama: Privatization of government-held IRHE is now
              complete; 51% of distribution and generation was sold in
              1998. The government plans to retain control of transmission.
              Foreign investors are involved in building some generation.
              The big news is the Central American integrated grid, which
              should join Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
              Costa Rica, and Panama into a single market by 2006.  The
              IADB is running project.

           ?  Peru: The new Energy Minister, Chamot, favors re-starting the
              privatization program, stalled since September '99.  SOUs
              mentioned for privatization were six regional energy
              companies, as well as a 850MW Andean hydro complex, Mantaro.
              It was not clear what form privatization would take; nor is
              it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and
              fled.  Peru also announced bids for construction and
              operation of two transmission lines.  Currently, only large
              industrials, representing 10% of the market, have choice.
              There are no plans to expand this.

           ?  Trinidad and Tobago: While there has been a partial
              unbundling of the generation arm of T&TEC, the government
              utility retains control of T&D as well as of all of natural
              gas purchases.  There been neither much IPP nor privatization
              activity since the sale of 49% of T&TEC to Southern and BP
              Amoco in 1996 and the financing of one IPP in 1998.

           ?   Venezuela: The Chavez government imposed an electricity
              restructuring law in August 1999.  Industrials can choose
              their supplier, but there are no plans to open the market
              completely.  A wholesale market is proposed for 2002.
              Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere,
              due to high subsidization.  While the government dithered on
              privatization plans, AES jumped in with a surprise bid for
              the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas.  The government recently
              announced a tentative sale date of early 2001 for 51% of two
              regional electric companies, Enelven and Semda.
              Privatization has oft been postponed, most recently because
              of unknown effects of Venezuela's new electricity law on its
              rate policy.

           ? Virgin Islands: In September '00, this U.S. territory's Senate
             quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for
             an 80% purchase of the Water and Power Authority.  The Islands
             could use the money, but the Senate objected to the lack of
             bidding or transparency.  It was in principle opposed neither
             to privatization nor to Southern.

      African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their
      power sectors to foreign investment, although most have not moved
      beyond allowing IPPs.  Many Gulf-States' IPPs are for water and
      power.   Increasingly, power sector forecasts include reliance on the
      private sector for generation capacity additions.  Five Sub-Saharan
      countries have privatized their power systems: C"te d'Ivoire, Gabon,
      Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.  A few countries are beginning to discuss
      partial privatization of the entire government-owned entity, rather
      than spinning off G-T-D and undergoing separate privatization.

      Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put
      pressure on prices, due to sustained droughts, especially in East
      Africa.   Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing
      restructuring agendas in different countries.

      A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the
      schemes for regional transmission links.   The Mozambique
      Transmission Company links South Africa, Mozambique, and Swaziland;
      the West African Power Pool will link 16 countries; there is a
      Six-Country link underway between Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and
      Turkey, and later Lebanon.

           ?  Algeria: Interior minister Khelil, who as a World Bank
              official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in
              several countries, is committed to "a profound restructuring
              of Sonatrach (the NOC) and the power sector (Sonelgaz)."
              Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle
              G-T-D, end Sonelgaz' generation monopoly, and allow for IPPs
              on a B-O-T basis. Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic
              consumption, and some for export.  Algeria is keenly
              interested in sending power to deregulating European markets
              via a new undersea link to Spain.

           ?  Ghana:  With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River,
              98% of Ghana's current power needs are supplied by
              hydroelectricity. Ghana's planned privatization of its
              distribution company into 4-5 regional companies is possible
              in 2001.  It is implementing a series of power sector reforms
              designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to
              electricity and to transform Ghana into a middle-income
              country within one generation.  It is moving to reduce its
              reliance on hydro-power by allowing IPPs to build deisel,
              gas, and light crude plants.  Regionally, Ghana is committed
              to building a West African Power Pool (WAPP) by expanding
              electricity generation and interconnections.

           ?  Morocco:  Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded
              for Tangiers and Tetouan.  The concession covers the
              provision of water, sewerage, and electrical services to
              these two northern areas. Two earlier power/water concessions
              (Casablanca, Rabat) were awarded.  Morocco has an active IPP
              program; one of the plants was even transferred to the
              builders after its completion.  No sale of transmission
              assets is planned.

           ?  Nigeria: The IMF has provided Nigeria a $1billion facility to
              encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo.
              In November, the government announced plans to privatize

              ailing NEPA, the SOU. While a draft electricity policy has
              been prepared, no details have emerged.  They intend to send
              regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of
              December, which should include a framework for foreign IPP
              investors.  It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up,
              prior to privatization. Enron is supplying 270MW via 9
              barge-mounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power
              shortages in this oil-rich country.

           ?  Senegal: Showing how risky foreign investment remains, the
              new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qu,bec and Elyo to
              leave, less than two years after they won a 34% interest in
              state EU S,n,lec.  The current government, while
              acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants,
              cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors.

           ?  South Africa: Eskom, South Africa's parastatal, generates 95%
              of the country's power, and transmits it over national lines
              to municipal distributors.  South Africa is moving slowly
              towards restructuring and unbundling of G-T-D.  The
              fragmented distribution system will be merged into six
              discos, while plants may be grouped into gencos. Last year,
              G-T-D activities were "ring-fenced" to evaluate costs for
              each business.  A new structure for the electricity supply
              industry is being discussed, and the possibility of
              privatizing 30% of Eskom's power stations has been raised for
              the first time. Electricity regulators announced in November
              that they were considering three bids for the first IPP
              license, to be offered next year. While South Africa needs
              new generation capacity by 2004, it now exports power to its
              neighbors, and is very active in the creation of a regional
              transmission network.  Eskom has ambitions to be a global
              player, while continuing to focus on its development agenda
              of rural electrification.  Eskom Enterprises, the unregulated
              business subsidiary, is considering an IPO.

           ?  Egypt: In July, the Egyptian Electricity Authority was
              converted into a holding company, although still state-owned.
              It intends to offer 49% stakes in seven or eight regional G&D
              companies.  The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity, valued at
              $2.1 billion, will be first, although it has been twice
              postponed.  All capacity additions will be solicited
              competitively as IPPs under the BOOT (build- own- operate-
              transfer) model. This allows developers to recover
              construction costs by running a plant, while the state
              eventually owns the project without affecting its debt
              profile.   Egypt is part of a planned Six-Country
              transmission link.

           ?  Israel: Israel has been discussing restructuring and
              privatization for a few years now, but no real progress has
              been made. An electricity law passed in March '96 extended
              the Israel Electric Company (IEC) license for 10 years in
              exchange for its accepting 10% of it power needs (900MW) from
              IPPs, and another 10% from foreign developers. So far, only
              one IPP has been built.  Recent offshore gas discoveries have
              been largely in Palestinian waters; further exploration will
              be necessary before Israel, which has no indigenous fuel
              sources, knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply.

           ?  Jordan: With virtually no indigenous oil or gas, Jordan has
              been highly dependent on Iraqi oil.  In early '98, NEPCO, the
              state utility, was corporatized, and G-T-D was unbundled.
              Jordan's first solicited IPP (450MW) was awarded to Tractebel
              in May.  There is talk of relying on IPPs for further
              generation and of privatizing existing assets.  Consultants
              were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution
              privatization.  Jordan's transmission grid was linked to
              Egypt in '98; the link to Syria should be completed soon.

           ?  Kuwait: Lifting a freeze on large projects, the cabinet has
              allowed two new IPPs (1000MW, 2500MW) with possible private
              financing options.  Forcasts for power show 5500 new MW
              needed in the next 15 years.

           ?  Lebanon:  After years of war, Lebanon is now engaged in
              massively rebuilding its infrastructure.  In April,
              consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on
              restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector.
              Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned Six-Country
              regional transmission linkup.

           ?  Palestine:   The outlook for Palestine's energy independence
              changed in a moment this Autumn, with offshore gas fields in
              acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial.  It has
              been nearly totally dependent on Israel's IEC for power.

           ?  Qatar: Officials announced in February that they had invited
              five companies to submit proposals for an IPP.  Foreign
              developers would hold a 60% stake in a plant envisioned to
              begin at 200MW, rising later to 1100MW.  A decision would
              turn on a bid of less than 5.5 cents/kWh to generate power.
              Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs.

           ?  Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia's 5% demand growth has created a
              need for an additional 50GW of capacity by 2020, much of
              which will need to come from the private sector.
              Privatization of the sector is being considered, as is an
              unbundling of G-T-D.  As a first step, in February, the ten
              power companies were merged.  In April, the Saudi Electricity
              Company was created as a joint-stock company, 50%
              government-owned.  The consensus among potential investors is
              that much needs to be done on the regulatory system, the
              financial framework, and on tariffs before IPPs become
              feasible.  For instance, nationals pay only nominal amounts
              for power.  Early considerations of BOT projects to meet
              soaring demand were shelved.

           ?  Tunisia: The Parliament passed enabling legislation for
              independent power in April '96.  While the government will
              continue to control D-T and international trade, all new
              generation will be open to the private sector.  The first
              IPP, for 471MW, is scheduled to come online in 2001.  It will
              produce 20-25% of Tunisia's electricity.

           ?  United Arab Emirates: The UAE is a confederation of 7
              Emirates.  Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi; it
              and Dubai provide over 80% of UAE income.  In '98, the UAE
              called for comprehensive restructuring of the power/water
              authority, and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE
              nationals.  While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still
              anticipated, Dubai has decided not to privatize these
              sectors.  Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai, as
              both BOO and BOOT. The UAE's need for additional power may be
              met by a grid linking several Gulf States' systems, which is
              under discussion between the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
              Kuwait, and Bahrain.

I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first 
bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS 
examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.

I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.

I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.  I think that's 
probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses 
the ranges in the MD level.

Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the 
results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make 
sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott 
Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.

Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's 
PRC.  If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.

Hi Steve--I don't know if you will be expected to represent me in the PRC, 
but I thought I'd send you my accomplishments in case you are.  Or for 
interesting reading anyway!

I think the message Christi prepared is great.  Check with her one last time 
and then let it  go.

Christie, great job on Steve's message below.  Also, check with Marge Nadasky 
for items from the Signature Shop that could be used as giveaways to our 
group.

   
	
	

I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The 
"Who wants to help Millions" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think 
Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out 
Tues. 7/18 similar to this:

Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions?  
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via 
email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).  
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees 
to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be 
played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart 
representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your 
participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous 
participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE 
FUN!

Other items:

Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring 
and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose 
other UW agencies to sponsor through activities.  
We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do 
we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's 
car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on 
August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get 
their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.

As part of our membership the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee 
(DCCC) is hosting a small private dinner to thank individuals/corporations 
for their support during the 2000 election cycle on Tuesday, December 12, 
2000 at John O'Quinn's home located at 6 Shadder Way.  There is a reception 
at 7:30 p.m. and dinner is at 8:00 p.m.  Representatives Dick Gephardt, 
Martin Frost, Gene Green , Ken Bentsen, Jim Turner, Nick Lampson and Sheila 
Jackson Lee will be in attendance.

Do we have anyone that is available to attend this event?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

I agree.  It doesn't appear that we have the need for his skills that we had 
even a few months ago.  I see that you are in contact with Michelle Hargrave 
about next steps.  Anything you want me to do at this point?

Have also today spoken to Anthony Duenner, finally.  I am afraid the message 
for David is that we should be thinking about his exit.  I cannot see much 
mileage in putting him in front of Cliff.  Do you agree that we should be 
discussing exit package?   thanks  mcs

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Rebecca

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?

Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably 
already have this, Lisa).  This organization represents perhaps the biggest 
near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will 
require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory 
fora, and perhaps new countries.  From time to time, I'm sure we will all be 
called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive.

Steve,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call 
out" number from the charts ... specifically,what happened to microsoft's 
turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 
12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?

It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color 
scheme looks good.

I sent before i looked at the distro of this message - so sorry, G
	
	

all;
Attached are the screen shots to give you an idea how the red/green color 
coding for rating movement from mid year ratings will appear on the screen.  
Is this more of what you had in mind?   Let me know what you think.  G

Also, can you please confirm my understanding that the tenure color coding is 
TENURE AS A VP (AND MD?) and not tenure in the organization? 

 

Mo - please set up a call

Dear Steve:

I have given some thought to the ideas you and I discussed regarding a 
website to promote a light-hearted view of some of the more absurd activities 
of the anti-deregulation and monopoly forces in the electricity battle.

I think my White House Writers Group colleague Michael Long would love to 
take this on.  He has an eclectic background: he spent considerable time as a 
stand-up comedian, then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator 
Fred Thompson.  He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard 
taking the air out of Herblock, the Washington Post editorial cartoonist.

(His bio is on our website: 
http://www.whwg.com/Firm/WritersBio.cfm?StaffId=19. )  

Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas, and has 
expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients, including 
high-profile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates.  I believe he 
could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of 
humorous stuff you have in mind.  I would work closely with him to make sure 
we were getting the issues right.

I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael "loose" on the 
material.  He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and 
elsewhere, then come up with some preliminary material, including a few 
suggestions of how we should format it for a website

If you think he has the hang of it, we could have a longer discussion about 
how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update 
the material.  

December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give 
this a try.  Let me know what you think.  I?d be happy to set up a call with 
the three of us.

I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue 
to work together.

Best,

Daniel

I need your advice on an internal distribution list for the notice.   Thanks,

Don't forget the Corporate Development Holiday Luncheon tomorrow at Brennan's 
at 12 Noon.  See you there!

Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, 
but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
so there is no demand response when prices rise.  

On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?

Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:

1. General
May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's 
"import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state 
infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 
80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the 
in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can 
we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the 
right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.

2. Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The 
midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest 
(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border.

We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points 
with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today 
when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?
Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.

Congratulations!
We are pleased to announce that Jim Noles, president and chief operating 
officer of Enron Wind, will assume the additional role of chief executive 
officer, effective immediately.  Jim will continue to be based in Houston.

Jim joined Enron Wind as its president in May of this year.  Prior to that 
appointment, Jim was managing director for Enron's Operations Support Group 
of Global Asset Operations and provided operations and maintenance oversight 
and technical assistance to Enron's worldwide facilities.

Previously, Jim worked with Enron International's Asset Management team where 
he formed the North American Asset Management Group to provide operation and 
Prior to joining Enron, Jim was an international marketer for TRW's Systems 
Integration Group with responsibilities in the Middle East.  Jim served in 
the U.S. Army for 25 years, culminating his career as a Brigadier General.  
His education includes a bachelor's degree from the University of North 
Alabama and a master's of public administration from the University of 
Alabama.

I left Hannon a message that we PAID for the attention we got from 
Wimbledon.  It came out of the advertising budget.  We did Kevin a favor by 
trying to leverage our media budget to create new business for EBS.  Am I 
looking at this the right way?

Mark
Kevin Hannon @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 07/14/2000 04:36:19 PM
I appreciated Margaret's update here but I was looking for a bit more.  
Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we 
received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount 
from Corp to EBS.  I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think 
about it the analysts are very focused on EBS's streaming revenue, which has 
been tough to come by.  Also it really is a net zero dollar amount to Enron 
at the end of the day but hopefully value creating to the stock price.  Hope 
this is not a problem.

	Margaret Allen@ENRON

Hello Kevin,

David Tagliarino mentioned that you were interested in capturing the overall 
exposure we received through the Wimbledon deal. I have summarized the main 
visibility we received.  There were several more "freebies" in the end, but 
they are not accounted for in the following:

We had a total of 40 thirty-second commercials that ran on NBC and TNT (the 
Turner Network). We also had 8-10 billboards which said "This portion of 
Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron, a leading energy and broadband 
services company." The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs 
by saying, "Watch this on the net at www.wimbledon.net, streamed by Enron." 
There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well.

Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN, CNNsi and several 
other networks.  We had banners streaming on up to 10 websites, including 
www.msnbc.com, www.cnnsi.com and www.wimbledon.net.  There was also a static 
banner on the Wimbledon Channel, no matter which site you watched it on 
(Wimbledon, CNNsi or MSNBC).  All the banners took you to a jump page we 
created, located at www.enron.net/wimbledon. 

At Wimbledon we had 12 courtside seats and 24 grounds passes.  I was also 
told that we had a small paid contract with FastTV.com to stream the archived 
site. We released a press release on our services with IBM, IMG, TWII and 
Wimbledon several days into the event; and EBS sent out an email to top 
clients/potential clients directing them to the site.  Business Week is also 
releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section, which features 
the Wimbledon Club as a customer. 

Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer.  

Have a great day, Margaret

Thanks for the message.

Steve, I have heard "through the grapevine" that Amy Oberg has relayed to you 
that EBS will not be doing competitive intelligence and that you were 
dismayed to hear this.  

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software 
Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive 
intelligence.    However,  EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and 
market research.  We are providing the business units with the information 
that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. 

Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate 
level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company.   You 
and I both know this is not the way Enron operates.  

I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that 
EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units -- it is 
just not in the context  that  Amy thinks it should be in.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks for stepping in and backing up for Joe Sutton on Wednesday.  I wanted 
to provide you with talking points for your speaking engagement with our new 
hire analysts during their orientation.  As a reminder, you are scheduled to 
speak over lunch on Monday, July 17 from 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the 
Doubletree Hotel in the LaSalle Ballroom.

Purpose of the luncheon:  Welcome the new hire analysts and impart to them 
our important this program is to Enron.

The analyst program is the ultimate pipeline of top entry-level talent, 
strategically deployed to meet anticipated business needs.  We look to this 
program to provide the company with our future business leader.
The program is a premier partner in providing exciting career challenges in 
areas of Finance, Origination/Structuring, Technology, Risk Management, Sales 
and Marketing, Trading, Valuation, and Accounting. 
The analyst program is also an avenue for providing the solid foundation of 
knowledge and skill needed in a competitive and dynamic global corporation.
We are very excited to have you on our team.  This is a very exciting company 
that is always reinventing itself.  The opportunities are endless.

There will be 75 new hire analysts attending this orientation.  Other than 
the recruiting process, this is their first impression of Enron and Senior 
Management.  The first week of their orientation will consist of 
presentations given by all business units/operating companies.  Weeks two and 
three will consist of technical training (i.e., modeling, valuation, working 
styles, communicating effectively and computer training).  Additionally, we 
have social events scheduled to allow them to network with peers and 
management.  Additionally, I have attached a calendar of the orientation for 
your review.

Steve, let me know if you require additional information.  Thank you for your 
support in our new hire orientation efforts.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts  

I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that 
stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission 
structural issues.

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to 
support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a 
serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for 
years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation 
itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on 
making progress at FERC and in other fora.

I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be 
such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that 
we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through 
committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into 
something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we 
should go that route.

I look forward to the discussion.

Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON
07/17/2000 02:20 PM

Joe:  thanks.  Allison is arranging a brief (thirty minutes) Conference Call 
for sometime tomorrow  so we can assure that we are all on the same page on 
this issue.  Although we had supported the policy agreement, we had been on 
record to oppose for political reasons the bill's movement on a stand-alone 
basis since policing the grid does nothing to address the essential 
transmission structural changes the market is crying to have addressed in 
order to provide reliability.  However, given Jeff Brown's efforts, the 
political need for inoculation and other political developments, it is timely 
to once again discuss Enron's position.  I look forward to our call sometime 
tomorrow. Cynthia

FYI.  Thoughts?  JOE
janderson <janderson@elcon.org> on 07/17/2000 12:34:47 PM
Joe,

It is my understanding that you were on the call for a short time this
morning of the group dealing with reliability language.  The discussion
covered the chances of stand-alone reliability legislation.

Where do you stand on this issue?

As you are aware, ELCON has been opposed to any kind of stand-alone
legislation -- including reliability.  At first, we were not strongly
opposed to the stand-alone reliability piece.  However, we have become more
opposed as time has passed and we have seen how the vertically-integrated
recalcitrant utilities have been able dominate NERC and stifle any
progressive market-oriented movement.  We think things would be as bad --
if not worse -- with the stand-alone creation of NAERO.  The establishment
of NAERO -- alone -- would not be good for the development of markets.

Given this, we are concerned about how things are going.  However, we
aren't doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective.  We are
open to ideas.

John

 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
"go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.

Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions?  
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via 
email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).  
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees 
to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be 
played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart 
representatives will be playing for great prizes.  

I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage 
your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your 
help and HAVE FUN!

Any follow up questions or India press about the bloomeberg story I sent you 
yesterday?

Sanjay: Some information of possible interest to you. I attended a meeting 
this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups 
promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming 
WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week 
and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee 
looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was 
among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have 
an interest.

Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her 
the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send 
her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. 
One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of 
these items to Delhi. 

Joe

Joe Hillings
09/08/99 11:57 AM
Sanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and 
involvment.

A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services 
Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include "energy 
services" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 
2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among 
the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and 
cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, 
investment, etc.

This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him 
about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. 
After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other 
companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy 
services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them 
in India and possibly abroad.

Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the 
services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees 
with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with 
companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask 
that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me 
that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key 
person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make 
such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.

I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I 
distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to 
Sudaker today.

Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in 
this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to 
have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.

Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get 
something done in October.
Joe

PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World 
Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I 
have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but 
not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to 
participate.

Joe asked me to get in touch with you regarding Indian media 
reports/inquiries on possible sale or sell down of Dabhol and to discuss a 
possible statement in the event we get additional inquiries.  Give me a call 
- 713-853-1586, home: 713-621-6550; pager: 888-906-9761.

I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.  This gives 
them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got 
price protection".

On the messages we need to include Mark's top three:  1) price caps cause 
shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together)

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

Jeff Dasovich on 07/18/2000 10:07:00 AM
Here's a draft.  Given sense of urgency, I tried to develop a target for 
folks to shoot at rather than The Perfect One-pager.  So please fire at 
will.  In particular, need PR to fill in "Media Approaches" and "Key Message 
Points."

Best,

I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives 
them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting 
price protection.

The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause 
shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better 
solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long 
term problems.

On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the 
fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of 
conservation and demand side management technology today (including its 
availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you 
don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday.  Our 
amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from 
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.  The BLM made 
a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key 
Senators and staff and they got nowhere.

Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House 
Conference members.  Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the 
key Republicans in the House.  We've already recruited the important 
Democrats.  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at 
least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.  We trust 
he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, 
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- 
at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even 
meeting to discuss the issue.

We continue, though, on several other fronts:

1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and 
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know 
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest 
Service have not gotten the message.  Our position is that we'll be satisfied 
that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood 
EBS build is retracted.
3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the 
longer-term issue next session.  We have no trouble finding champtions eager 
to own the issue
4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same
5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 
companies and associations now actively engaged.  Enron chairs this 
initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and 
stature as a serious communications player.
6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from 
the end-user perspective

BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We 
don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at 
this point.  So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the 
full court press.

I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any 
announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the 
group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.  We will do 
nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.  the 
best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the 
original announcement, not after the group gets underway.  Can we get in 
touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?

Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON

Jeff:  I have followed up with other DOE politicals who advised they will 
meet this Thursday with Bob Gee to finalize and approve his speech to NARUC 
on Monday, July 24th.  It is looking positive that he may be positioned to 
make the announcement Monday.  However, DOE will likely need to revisit some 
folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some 
of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on 
business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet  like 
APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.)  
Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability 
Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA 
Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only 
four meetings.  I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary 
Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week.  I have also 
discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.

Jeff Brown@EES
07/18/2000 12:45 PM
Cynthia and I met with Bob Gee regarding a potential role for DOE in creating 
a national standards board.  Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a 
"Blue Ribbon" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this 
issue.  In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a 
balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue.

We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure 
(governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization 
(retail, wholesale, gas, electric).  Bob plans to follow-up with us next week.

Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the 
government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective 
environmental records?  It seems to me that even though we are having our 
share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government 
did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up 
efforts.   Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such 
information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an 
analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging 
overly punitive action by the government.  What do you think?

I still need to talk to you about our public message in India.  I am on my

Hi guys.  My friend, Polly Traylor, is an editor at the Industry Standard in 
San Francisco.  One of her colleagues -- Michelle Rafter --  sent me the 
email below requesting an interview for an Enron story she is working on.  I 
have not spoken with this writer and am forwarding it to you for follow up. 

Hope all is well.  Call me if you have any questions. 

Hi Janel:

My name is Michelle Rafter and I'm a writer for the Industry Standard. I work 
with Polly Traylor who
suggested that I contact you for help. I'd like to talk to someone at Enron 
for a story I'm doing
for the Standard on Internet CEOs, including CEOs or presidents who've led 
traditional companies
into successful Internet ventures. I first need to identify who at Enron that 
person would be, i.e.,
who's most responsible for the success of the company's Internet ventures: 
Jeffrey Skilling (he got
the most ink in BusinessWeek's story in this issue), Kenneth Lay, or the head 
of EnronOnline. Then I
need to talk to someone who could help coordinate a phone interview with me 
(I'm in Los Angeles so
this would be a phone interview). Can you give me some suggestions? Ideally, 
I'd love to do an
interview this week, but have some flexibility.

Thanks so much in advance for any help you can give.

Will we capture these "accelerations" in our accomplishments?
Mark Schroeder@ECT
07/19/2000 07:44 AM
Several recent developments, and in the interest of economy (mine!), I am 
copying all of you, who will have varying interests in this.

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, 
October, and by 2002, October for gas.  Sadia, you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.  Margaret, FYI to 
you, too.

Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.  Paul H., suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002.  Sadia, I think this is 
again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.  Margaret and 
Kathryn, also note.

Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
"not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation".  I may take 
issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.  Can you work with 
Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for 
my review (and presumably your's, too)?  thanks

Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions.    
thanks  mcs

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.

Steve:  per your voicemail, we do not have a date yet but should have it 
before Congress leaves next Friday.  I'll let you know as soon as it is set.  
As you can see, I disagree with Mark per the attached e-mail I sent him 
earlier today.  I do not think it should be Jeff Skilling.  Mark does not 
appear to concur with me.  Perhaps I should go ahead and express our interest 
to testify and then we can have a conversation with the team to decide who 
should do it.  I was just trying to not waste a chit and ask for a spot if we 
had no interest.  We can determine who and what later.  So, before I ask the 
Committee, we DO want to testify, correct?
Cynthia Sandherr
07/19/2000 12:00 PM

Mark:  I disagree.  The field hearings are not as high profile as a D.C. 
hearing.  Further, we can wait to see who PG&E sends and others.  Likely the 
California utilities will send their CEO's so if we need to be on the same 
panel with them we would need to send Jeff Skilling.  But, tactically, we may 
not wish to do this?  Otherwise, we can go for a technical person or for 
someone like Steve Kean......this will be for local press and politicals more 
so than federal (I doubt that more than 4-6 Congressional members even 
show.)  Again, we have not been asked to testify.  I was just trying to 
ascertain if we were interested to be asked.......let me know  your further 
thoughts.  thanks.

I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.  Because energy 
and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets 
involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, 
labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to).  
That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the 
business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which 
business strategies will be successful.

Vince Kaminski suggested I contact you, I'm the Gov't Affairs rep for NNG in

emphasis in regulatory politics, specific to energy and telecom market 
convergence and the public interest. I'd welcome any advice or suggestions 
you have regarding other potential area's of research, based on your 
professional experience in the public policy arena.

I appreciate any guidance, I'm in the earliest stages of forming my advisory 
committee and curriculum of study. My supervisor, Mike McGowan, sends his 
regards. 

My message was sent before I finished it.
I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay  
--  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) 
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their 
business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating 
to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with 
the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but 
also some substantial and interesting differences.
Good luck with your studies.
My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.

Steve and Mark:  

I arrived in the US on Saturday with a good feeling about what appears to be 
a successful resolution of the Chorety crisis.  Under Steve Hopper's 
leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.  During the 
crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael 
Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached).  
At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the 
site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and 
discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing 
inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   

I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident 
Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in 
response to stakeholder concerns.  The Plan was updated daily by the 
Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every 
meeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement 
the Operations Report.  

I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early 
stages of the crisis.  It was extremely helpful.

Regards, Keith

In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally

	We have already submitted our budget for PR, Govt' affairs, Facilities, corp HR etc.  Does the process below affect my numbers (please say no).

		 -----Original Message-----
		The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

		We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

*	Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

*	For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

*	The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

		If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

	Steve - would you like to see these when we send them to the pipeline people?

In response to the possibility of terrorist actions in retaliation for ongoing U.S. military operations against sites in Afghanistan, federal authorities have taken the following actions:

1) DOE has increased its security condition from SECON-3 to SECON-2.  Per DOE, SECON-2 "is set when a terrorist incident occurs or intelligence information is received indicating that some form of terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection measures to be put in place."
2) NERC has gone to its highest threat level, Threat Level 3.
3) DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety has opened its Crisis Management Center.

In addition, the Energy Security Council, while noting that no specific threats against any infrastructure have been been identified, today urged participants to maintain the highest levels of vigilance and evaluate whether additional security measures were warranted.

I have been forwarded this message, quite to my surprise...considering my reputation.  I should probably not have sent this to you but I will concede to the humour.

Steve- I spoke with Gay this afternon.  She gave Karen a very rough
earnings release this morning.  It needs a ton of work.  Butts says
numbers not available until at least Wed.  We should be able to sit down
amd discuss the conference call "items" with you late tomorrow.  We can
talk this evening.  Thanks.  MEK

I'm meeting with Jerry Patterson today.  He is running for Texas Land Commissioner.  Jean said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that Ken has made a personal contribution.  Eliz - please tell me what we have given -- PAC and corporate, if any.  Sally - could you tell me of Ken's personal contribution?

Good update.  Please put me on the distribution list for future installments.
What about the net benefits test?  Will the rate agreement suffice?  call to discuss.

Thanks for the update. My only concern is that we should really try to go for a much shorter time period for Oregon.  I would think about 6 months.  After all, that is NWN's attraction.  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months.  Paul, can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board?  Thanks.

Three matters:

1.	Conference call with Staff.

Particpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE's rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.  

	Timing.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.

	Financing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.  

	Other Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.  

	Process.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.  

2.	Other parties

	Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.  

	We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.

3.	Rate Conditions.

	We're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.

	Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny).  

	PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.  

4.	FERC Review

	We're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis.  A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week.  

--end--

I've talked to McConnell, Shankman and Reck and gave them my OK.

	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  

Below are a few points for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff
 

 

I think this would be awkward given the large number of Business units

Mary -- We had talked about having the business unit CEOs talk about the two or three slides covering their business.  I think it would be a good way to broaden the management team and give them exposure with employees.  Could we work that in?  thx. kd

Steve/Karen/Cindy:  See Ken's response below.  

Cindy, let's talk about the survey results.

Also, Steve, I hope we can talk about our business strategy.  This is something employees have asked us for.  Can you help me with this?  Thanks.

Mary:

We'll key off of the 3rd quarter financial presentations but add 3 or 4 slides on employee survey and what we're doing about it.

Ken

Ken, Greg and Mark:

Our next all-employee is scheduled for Oct. 23 at 10 a.m at the Hyatt Regency Houston.  Steve Kean asked me send you a reminder about the meeting and for you to be thinking about messages for both our investors and our employees.  This will help when compiling the presentation slides.  

Also, please let me know if all of you plant to participate in giving the presentation.  Thanks.

Attached is my resignation from the PAC.

 

Why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses.  We have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing.  We simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced.

What do you think about something like this in response to the layoff question?  It could become our new "standard corporate policy."

Karen -- 

Here's the safest statement I know for our situation as it relates to employment:

"We do not speculate about future employment levels.  If and when we have ever have changes affecting employees, we tell them first."

(Of course, we'll need to pretend that we didn't break the Europe layoff on Dow Jones!)

Vance

fyi

The ALJ issued his initial decision on the CPUC complaint case today.  As was widely expected, he found that El Paso and its merchant affiliate, El Paso Merchant, were guilty of affiliate abuse.  However, he did not find clear evidence that they were exercising market power.

The ID is attached.

 

Packet is on it's way by fed ex.  Maureen will call the organizers.

Send me the details, but it looks a.o.k. for me on the 19th.

wanted to make sure you saw this
I understand you are working on a "test" of our evacuation procedures.  I am very concerned about this given the density of our floors in our old building and also, given the amount of people we have in the new building, with its on-going construction.  When are we going to have a "drill " of some kind--the sooner the better for our employees peace of mind. Thank-you,  Beth

I'm sure you are aware of this, but I am passing along just in case.

I had not seen this in the Enron Mentions...and am probably glad it didn't appear.

please reply to Lucy.  thanks

Are there going to be any security measures taken for those of us in 3AC?
I hope so ? it would make us all feel safer.

      -----Original Message-----
     Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
     Some  of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
     personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
     be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday
     activities.   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
     to  increase  your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize
     disruption to our day-to-day business.

     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp.  Security  resides  in  our
     business  controls  organization.   You  can contact this organization
     through  their  website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>),  by phone
     (713-345-2804),     or     by    email    (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
     <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director,
     Business  Controls,  leads  this  organization.   Please  feel free to
     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions, or to
     report security threats.

     We  have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel
     advisory.

     Access to the Enron Center

     Over  the  next few days, the following access control procedures will
     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  (and  other  facilities  where
     practical):

          ?   As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
             the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to
             the bearer.

          ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present
             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S.
             driver's  license,  U.S.  or foreign passport, or some form of
             U.S. federal, state or local identification).

          ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must
             completely  fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without
             a  valid  photo  ID  (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign
             passport,  or  some  form  of  U.S.  federal,  state  or local
             identification)  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron
             Center.

          ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron
             employee or badged contractor at all times.

          ?   Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an
             Enron  employee  or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's
             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged
             contractor,   and  escorted  to  their  appointment.   At  the
             conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor, the visitor
             badge  collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the
             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged
             contractor.

          ?   Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines; report
             suspicious  activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open
             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors
             open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be
     instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that all employees be patient during
     congested  times  in  the  lobby.   As we proceed and obtain increased
     guard   personnel  and  equipment,  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to
     decrease.   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted
     for the security of all our employees.

     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we have two important
     recommendations:

          ?   While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided.   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia,
             Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia,
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In  addition,  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West
             Bank,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be
             very carefully considered.

          ?    For  non-U.S.  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States,
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation.
             There  have  been  several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights.  As  a
             result,  we  suggest  that all non-U.S. citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport, Form I-94 and
             Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of  18 to carry his/her "registration" documentation
             with  them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card,  Form  I-94  card, Employment Authorization Card, Border
             Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card. Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   "registration"   documentation,  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere, it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status.

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

We are setting up a process to respond directly to these and other comments, questions and concerns.  Our success depends in part on our responsiveness to these observations.

Steve and John -

Points well taken.  Please address the concern and respond to Aaron.

Ken

Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

Aaron Berutti

STEVE,   I AM THE OFFICE MANAGER FOR THE ISC AND HANDLE SECURITY AND SAFTEY

SECURITY MEASURES FOR THE ENRON EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN 2 ALLEN CENTER AND 3

     Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
     Some  of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
     personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
     be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday
     activities.   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
     to  increase  your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize
     disruption to our day-to-day business.

     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp.  Security  resides  in  our
     business  controls  organization.   You  can contact this organization
     through  their  website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>),  by phone
     (713-345-2804),     or     by    email    (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
     <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director,
     Business  Controls,  leads  this  organization.   Please  feel free to
     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions, or to
     report security threats.

     We  have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel
     advisory.

     Access to the Enron Center

     Over  the  next few days, the following access control procedures will
     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  (and  other  facilities  where
     practical):

          ?   As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
             the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to
             the bearer.

          ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present
             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S.
             driver's  license,  U.S.  or foreign passport, or some form of
             U.S. federal, state or local identification).

          ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must
             completely  fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without
             a  valid  photo  ID  (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign
             passport,  or  some  form  of  U.S.  federal,  state  or local
             identification)  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron
             Center.

          ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron
             employee or badged contractor at all times.

          ?   Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an
             Enron  employee  or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's
             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged
             contractor,   and  escorted  to  their  appointment.   At  the
             conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor, the visitor
             badge  collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the
             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged
             contractor.

          ?   Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines; report
             suspicious  activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open
             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors
             open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be
     instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that all employees be patient during
     congested  times  in  the  lobby.   As we proceed and obtain increased
     guard   personnel  and  equipment,  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to
     decrease.   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted
     for the security of all our employees.

     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we have two important
     recommendations:

          ?   While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided.   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia,
             Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia,
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In  addition,  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West
             Bank,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be
             very carefully considered.

          ?    For  non-U.S.  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States,
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation.
             There  have  been  several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights.  As  a
             result,  we  suggest  that all non-U.S. citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport, Form I-94 and
             Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of  18 to carry his/her "registration" documentation
             with  them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card,  Form  I-94  card, Employment Authorization Card, Border
             Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card. Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   "registration"   documentation,  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere, it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status.

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

In my email inbox I have a few expense reports for me and John Brindle.  Please review and approve John's.  Please check on mine:  they show that they are paid but on one it looks like they paid double.  It may be that the first one didn't go so they reissued it, but I just want to make sure that it was paid and only paid once.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

here it is

 

What do you know about this guy?

Hi, Steve.  I hope all is well.

Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson.  Apparently, he's running 
for Texas Supreme Court and he wanted to know if this guy "lives the 
values," so to speak.  He hasn't called him yet, but just wanted your 
perspective on him when you have a chance.

Jeff is traveling at the moment, but you can e-mail me or Jeff directly at 
jeff_skilling@hotmail.com.

Thanks for your help.  SRS

I like your revised version.

I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think?

 

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Our information is that the emergency phone number is 3-6200, but your
message indicates that it should be 3-6300 (see below)......which is
correct?

           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very carefully
           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act

           asking  domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current

           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

I like the first opening paragraph better.

Also, please don't use the term "corporate relations".  I think "community relations" works fine and won't create as much confusion with public relations, corporate communications or other functions.  thanks

Here's the latest draft of the Organization Memo and the Org Chart.

 << File: Organizational Announcement 10.10.01 (Draft).doc >> 

 << File: C_olson_orgcht16.pdf >> 

I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.  Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we'll put it in front of derrick.

Justice Jefferson is the first African American Justice on the Texas Supreme Court.  He practiced appellate law (he has twice argued and won before the U. S. Supreme Court.)  He is very well respected.  
 
He called me late Tuesday asking for a campaign contribution.  I called Jim Derrick who is traveling until Friday.  Jim indicated that he was supporting Justice Jefferson.  
 
Do we give money from our PAC budget for Supreme Court Justices or does that go through Jim? I need to return Justice Jefferson's call and let him know if we can support him. What do you think?  Thanks, Jean

Steven,
 
I enjoyed meeting you today and thanks for your thoughts and insights into Enron.
 
I look forward to meeting some of the business unit leaders and Mark in ten days.
 
See you around the neighborhood.

Thanks for your message.  We met about the fire drill process yesterday
and will have something shortly.  One of the issues we are facing is the
absence of "floor wardens" -- people who know the procedure and can help
it move smoothly if there is a problem.  If you are willing to
volunteer, contact mike terraso.  thanks

Mr. Kean,
I want to thank you and your group for keeping us informed of new safety
rules so we all understand the reasons for the changes.  I have 1
question.

Will you be sharing/reviewing/revising fire drill/building evacuation
instructions.  In the past, our fire drills have instructed us just to
go
to the door of the stairwells.  If we really had to evacuate the
building,
where should we go after we exit the stairwells and building?  Would the
recommendation be to wait in the park area in front of ECN, walk towards
an
area that is not near high structures, a freeway underpass, etc. or is
that
decision left to our discretion?

Thanks, Lillian Villarreal - ETS IT group

           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States,
corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There
have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside
in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for
documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we
suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the
United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien
status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.
We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry
their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status
as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration
Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality
Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry
his/her
           "registration"  documentation  with  them at all times. This
can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card,
Employment
           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a
Temporary
           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically
been
           asking  domestic travelers for "registration" documentation,
but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and
current
           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of
your
           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on
the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Steve, I was planning to piggyback this onto a trip to Washington in November and make the presentation myself.  Mike

Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson?

Mike,

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation,
given our relationship with the Wharton School. I  think it can be somebody
below Steve's level - the occasion does not justify allocating
time of a senior executive.

Vince

Vince, What is your opinion regarding the value of making a presentation?  Mike

Please discuss with Vince.  I don't know how to engage relative importance

Steve, if you think it would be of value to have someone speak  on at the Wharton School Energy Club, I can develop a presentation addressing the topic Global Warming and the Energy Industry.  Mike

Look at the topic below.  Should we send somebody?
Steve,

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

Vince

Vince:

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Michael

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

Stan Horton called about the production tax credit for Enron Wind. (Enron Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to Mark Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for Stan as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.

Here is the most recent update I have.  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing.
The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).  Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.  Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe.

fyi....

Amit - Congress is on recess until September and will not adjourn in October as planned.  We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December. 

The PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package (it was part of the tax title).  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October.  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well.

Now to the timing, it is unclear if the energy package (with the PTC extension)will move before Congress adjourns for the year.  If it does not, then Congress can pass what it calls an "extenders package" which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.  If that were to not happen, then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December 31, 2001.  Any of theses scenarios is possible.

While nothing is 100% when you deal with Congress, I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next.  The question then becomes for how long.  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate.  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers.

Let me know if you need additional information.
 

Chris,

We wanted to get an update on what was happending with the PTC in Washington.  Are we still on track to get an extension before Congress adjourns in early October?  What if any impact will the debate surrounding the reduction in the budget surplus have on the PTC?

thanks

Amit Walia

				Linda and I are following the PTC for Corp. out of DC.  Ed Coats in Enron Corporate Tax leads from Houston.  We have a Bracewell Patterson attorney in DC retained to support our corporate tax efforts on Capitol Hill.  

				Enron Wind also has a lobbyist dedicated 24/7 to this effort.

				Chris,

				Thanks very much for the prompt reply.  This is exactly what I needed.  Who is working this in-house?  Do we have any outside resources devoted to it?

				Mark

					 -----Original Message-----
					Mark - I left a voice mail on your cell.

					The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2001.   The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.

					The question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:

					1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.

					2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an "extenders" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.  In this scenario, the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest.

					Mark, this is Congress, so anything can change.  

					Call me with any questions at (202) 466-9158.

Absolutely ... Im sorry I saw this so late... we could have talked today.  Let's talk Mon

Hi  Steve,
 
I was wondering if  you would have 30 minutes to meet with me sometime in the near future for  confidential reasons. You asked me on Monday if everything is "all right" and  the answer is "not really." I request this meeting for personal reasons, more on  mentor basis, than employee to employer. 
 
Would that be  possible? If so, I would also request that we meet early in the morning, or on a  conference room on another floor. It is difficult to meet on this  floor without everyone immediately knowing/questioning your intentions.  
 
Thanks for you time,  Margaret
 
 

I assume you get these; if not, you should make sure you are on the list.
We have been notified by Trizechan Properties that there will be a scheduled shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center on October 27th at 4:00 P.M. The outage is scheduled to last for approximately 4 hours. I will forward any additional information I receive.

we will need to get new business cards
Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Request: Is ICE regulated by the CFTC?
Response: The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission only to the extent the markets are made on the exchange for products that have already been designated futures contracts by the commission. 
 
ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house, the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange, would clear cash-settled U.S. oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U.S. natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub. Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial.
 
The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA),  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements, contracts, or transactions before the date of enactment of this section. This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective.
 
DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges, as well as electronic-only exchanges, have been approved by the CFTC. Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street, Inc., appear to be pending.  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY EDITS TO THIS Email.  I want to send it to the DC staff.

Out of super super precaution, Enron security and others in Houston have recommended that personnel in the DC office be tested for Anthrax exposure.  They do not think there is a problem, but nonetheless recommended that we take this step.  I am awaiting word on where we should go for the test.  Also, please let Carolyn Cooney know if you have had any visitors to the DC office, who have been to Capitol Hill in the last three weeks. 

Again, this is strictly out of precaution, as we strongly believe there is NOT a problem.  In the meantime, while normal business will not be possible with Capitol Hill, let me encourage everyone to continue working on those internal projects we can get done and have been waiting for a quiet moment to do so.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):

Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood
A "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.

Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.

Attached for your review and any comments is a draft legislative action plan of initial steps to be taken on RTOs when Congress returns next week.  We will also be sending this draft plan to our lobbying consultants for their input and discussion at our meeting/conference call next Tuesday afternoon.  As always, your input is much appreciated.

I didnt select them.

Steve, I requested the attached file from Mike Cacace of Fortune after Meredith and Vance told me they received a survey for this year's Most Admired Companies (the one that has ranked us most innovative for the past six years).  Did you select the people on this list?  It seems odd that Vance, Meredith and Mark are included this year.  Also, Rebecca Carter and Jeff Skilling should be deleted.  It appears that these surveys have already been mailed.  

Hi Mary,

Please find the attached list of executives and directors that are in our
database for the 2001 Survey of Corporate Reputations.  Please review and advise
if there are any changes.  There can be a maximum of 10 executives and 7
directors.

Misha please handle. 
Dear Ms.Olson: 

I was speaking with Missy Stephens yesterday and she told me you would be the 
appropriate person to address this request. 

I am excited to be working on many development and event projects, and it is 
in that context that I write. 

I know you are familiar with The Houston Forum's long-standing reputation as 
the preeminent speakers forum in Houston. I know they welcome your support 
and sponsorship in any way you deem appropriate, but we hope Enron is able to 
participate as a program underwriter and/or sponsor. The following is a list 
of the confirmed speakers over the next several months as well as those 
pending for 2002: 

1. The Honorable Alberto Gonzales, Cousel to the President George  W. Bush 
will join us for a luncheon program on Sept. 7th at the Houston Club. This 
program is being done in conjunction with the Houston Bar Association. 

2. Robert Reynolds-Vice Chairman and COO of Fidelity Investments is 
presenting on September 19th in a late afternoon event at the Junior League. 

3. Septemeber 24th is our Energy Roundtable luncheon program-moderated by 
Matt Simmons of Simmons & Co.-at the Hyatt Regency. 

4. On October 3rd, we host Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand-the director 
General of the World Trade Organization. This is a luncheon program to be 
held at the Houston Club. 

5. November 13th we will welcome presidential historian and analyst, Michael 
Beschloss. Dr. Beschloss will discuss his most recent publication on the 
tapes of President Lyndon Johnson. This will be a very popular event and 
there are special sponsorship opportunities attendant with it. 

6. On December 6th, we are pleased to host The Honorable David Ivry-Israel's 
Ambassador to the United States. This afternoon program will take place at 
the Junior League. 

7. March 11, 2002, is the date for our luncheon program at the Hyatt Regency. 
Our very special guest will be the Honorable James A. Baker III, 61st U. S. 
Secretary of State. This event will certainly sell out. 

8. State Senator Rodney Ellis will join us on April 28, 2002. 

Robert Bartley, Editor of the Wall Street Journal, will be speaking in 2002, 
but the date and venue are pending. We are also planning on hosting the 
Honorable John Breaux, U. S. Senator, and Cabinet officials Paul O'Neill and 
Spencer Abraham. 

If I might, let me share with you the particulars of the sponsorships and 
underwriting options available to  you. 

A sponsorship of $10,000 will enable you or your designee to introduce the 
speaker from the podium. You will also be given 8 memberships for a year and 
2 tables for the luncheon that you particularly sponsor. Additionally, you 
will have your logo on the program on the day of the event as well as on the 
website that enumerates all of our programs. You and your designees will be 
able to attend all private receptions before our events. 

A $2,500 sponsorship will provide Enron program logo exposure on the day of 
the event, a free table for 10 on that date, an invitation to the private 
reception prior to the event and a presence on our website. Finally, you will 
be given 4 complimentary memberships for a year. 

A donation of $1,000 will enable you to place your logo on our program on the 
day of the event. 

All of your sponsorships/donations are tax deductible and you will be 
identified as a sponsor in all of our corporate literature for a year. 

The November 13th program with Dr.Beschloss provides, as mentioned, special 
visibility. In addition to all things inherent in the $2,500 sponsorship, a 
$7,500 donation gives that particular sponsor a chance to print and insert 
corporate bookplates in all of our speaker's books to be sold at the event. 
You will also be able to separately sponsor a dinner with Dr. Beschloss and 
the guests of your choice. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to visit 
with  you in person if you would like. Again, thank you for your time and 
consideration of these high profile programs. I will follow up on this note 
in 2 weeks. 

Sincerely, 

Sherry Solomon

FYI.  I am definitely not responding to this
Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a "friend of Enron" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

[Kean, Steven J.] I'm copying Karen ... thanks for the heads up.  My view is we probably won't want to expend resources or Ken's time on this right now.  It looks like a story that can wait a bit. 
[Kean, Steven J.] 
 --Original Message-----
Steve, FYI.......think I should get Karen Denne involved????
Cindy  Thanks.  Let me give you a heads up.  You may be called by Bruce Nichols of the Dallas Morning News/ Houston Bureau.  He is an old friend and probably the best reporter in town.....and a big Ken Lay champion.  He's doing a story on the impact of Ken's current intense involvement in the company on his civic leadership.  The question is whether or not Houston was losing Ken's leadership because of his current Enron involvement.  My response obviouly was that the community benefitted greatly from his leadership during the many years that he served as the CEO, so the current situation is familiar territory.  I gave him your name because of your role.  Bruce is very supportive of Ken, and attended the press conference a couple of days ago.
 
Bob

Bob I will keep you posted!!!!!

Cindy--- look forward to seeng you today, although I will be a little late. The funeral for Bob Braden is this morning.  Bob chaired the Greater Houston Chamber, and of significance to me personally, Rice Center.  
 
We discussed Enron's representation on Central Houston's board.  Alan likes very much the Greg Whalley suggestion; so please go with it.
 
New adds to the board include:
Fred Burns, Chairman, Wortham Foundation
Jim Flores, Chairman & CEO, Plains Resources
Bob Harvey, Vice Chairman, Reliant
Bob Onstead
Al Bledsoe, Managing Partner, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (Al served previously in his Coopers capacity)
 
Pending (as soon as their companies join) are Jim Hackett, Chairman & CEO, Ocean Energy, and Mike Morgan, President, Kinder-Morgan.
 
Good luck with Greg; I am available on a moment's notice to meet with him.
 
Bob

Please look into this
Steve,

Info. from my folks (below) about not being able to access ENRON investor
website for conference call.  You might want to have someone check it out.
 

I understand from Ken's office that London has been cancelled.  I'd still
like to come down and talk to you and your folks.   Let me know when would
be a good time.

Harry
Harry, We ended not being successful in accessing the Enron web broadcast,
either live or archived. 

We could reach the page where one then clicked to enter the broadcast but
was not able to enter the broadcast itself, always getting an ERROR
message.

We tried to access both the Enron live and archived broadcasts, using 6
different computers including the web via Bloomberg, using three different
ISPs, and also three different platforms:  Windows, Windows NT and MAC. 
We also tried both RealAudio and Windows Media Player on each computer. 
We took the extra step to download the fresh versions of RealAudio and
Media Player, to make sure antiquated software was not causing our
problem. We tested the software packages on other sites, where each worked
fine.  Four C&W persons tried independently to access Enron's braodcast,
to make sure we weren't simply replicating an error on our part.  After
all this, still nothing. 

Redraft (confirm):

	Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.

	Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

whaddya think???

Please look into this and give Shelley a call back

With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:

1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....

We can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else, but the money to Brown is out the door.
I would still like to see the data.

Steve:

If I can get you current polling data that indicate vulnerability on the part of Brown, would the PAC reconsider providing support?

Jim

Bob Eury is asking Ken to lend his name and encourage employee support for light rail. Rosie please confirm with Ken, but I think he should allow Bob Eury to use his name in support of the mainstreet light rail project campaign (yes on prop 1 and no on prop 3), but I would say no on employee support (attending rallies etc) right now.  We have too much to do right now.  Assuming he agrees, let Misha know. 

Got your msg. Call me at 832.865.2445.

Nice work.  Thanks

Sue spoke on a panel today at the Valley Industry & Commerce Association (San Fernando Valley).  Marathon also attended and sent the following:  

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra

No, but thanks. 

Some additional background on the California refund issue.  Consistent with what we discussed; just some additional detail.
Steve,  

Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in, regarding the California refund case, and I passed the following along to him by phone:

Status of the refund claim:  

The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress, and the final claim at the FERC-ordered settlement conference, were approximately $38 MM.  The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar, although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us $1MM!  A review of their claim revealed errors.  I asked Charles River Associates to re-run the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a $57MM figure.  Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO.  However, I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time.  I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December 7, and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it.

Points summarizing the proceeding:

The California refund proceeding at FERC, unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding, contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds.
Issues to be decided by the Judge include (1) the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price (2) the amounts owed by each seller and (3) the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation.
This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISO's data.
Due to deficiencies in the data, it is also difficult to assess potential exposure. The California ISO's claims have thus far been erroneous.
Hearings are scheduled to occur on December 17-21 and February 11-15. The Judge's ruling is expected on March 8, 2002. 

Timing of the FERC Order:
It is difficult to say how quickly the Commission may rule after receiving the Judge's certification of findings and record on March 8.  Arguably, they could act very quickly due to the limited scope of the proceeding and the fact that the Judge's findings will likely be limited to the three issues described above.

Let me know if you need any more information.  I will copy you on significant memos in the case.  Regards,  Ray

Thanks so much for the message. I am hanging in and hanging on, as is everyone else. I have never seen such courage and strength in an uncertain environment. Thanks for your offer.. You hang in there too.

No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.  Thanks

Thanks, Steve. Do we need to change Cindy Olson's title? Let me know.

We should include David Oxley -- VP of human resources.

Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic "Save the Date" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

Note to Steven Kean

The July Update to the Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index),
published twice a year by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
(CAEM) shows Texas, Maine, and New York are making the most measurable
strides in promoting sustainable competition among electricity providers, as
customers throughout Pennsylvania retreat to their default providers due to
increasing wholesale prices.

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by
22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, today
released the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
in a 187 page report.  Key results included:
		 1. Pennsylvania		 		 66
		 2. Texas		 		 		 65
		 3. New York		 		 		 64
		 4. Maine		 		 		 62
		 17. California		 		 		 34

"These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on
which electric competition can grow," said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center.

"While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to
Pennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning to
their original utility suppliers.  It underscores how important it is to put
the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit
over the long haul," Malloy said.

In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Alberta
actually would rank above all the states with a score of 68.

The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinion
indicated that their commission is not "less likely to take action on energy
restructuring as a result of the California crisis."

CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whose
mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the
competitive model of regulation.

OK

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Jo Ann,
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in the group 7/16)
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   

I hope this "pleads our case" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. 

Thanks,
Deana

=09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and =

rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz=

spection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L=
aPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide =
only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

=09We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received =
inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia=

.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to th=

In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a=

=09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol=

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Great news.  With respect to the Commissoners, I think it makes sense to go back through Ellen and ask if she could set up meetings with a few commissioners ater the staff briefing.

Susan got it done -- it'll be Thursday, July 26, 1-4 p.m. at FERC (a room on
the 3rd floor?).  Susan has talked with Bill Albrecht.  He'll probably be
coming in on Wed. p.m. Steve, any ideas about a Commissioner strategy?
(invite them to attend, if the FERC folks agree; ask the FERC folks to do
the inviting; ask the FERC folks to help set up meetings afterwards or a
follow on if they like what we do and think it useful for Commissioners; try
to do a walkaround -- that is, offer to have Jerry, Bill, Susan visit
commissioners individually Friday a.m. after the course or Thursday a.m.
before the course?) Wendy

Welcome and thanks for contacting me.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  I'll ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks.  Maybe we could have lunch?

Also, my wife is working with the Dean of the Rice engineering school on a history of engineering at Rice.  If your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in Houston, we may be able to help out.

Steve,

How is everything?  I hope all is well.  I just wanted keep you updated on what I am doing.  I started with the 2001 Associate pool on August 6.  Currently, I am assigned to the East Power Fundamental Group under Lloyd Will.  I am doing fundamental analysis for the power traders and not surprisingly, most of the traders are not fond of AEP.  I think it's a good rotation in that the knowledge I gain in this group will help me immensely in a more commercial role in the future.

I am very interested in structuring and M&A work, at the same time trading is also something I would love to do should such opportunity become available.  I will try to look into the trading track program once I get settled here.  My wife is currently finishing her Masters degree at Columbia in Electrical Engineering and will look to find a job in Houston once she obtains her degree.

I will keep you updated on my future progress and please let me know if you have any suggestions.

As you requested, I have  prepared a list of my preferred public policy contacts for  California.  It is composed of professionals from an array of public,  private and non-profit backgrounds.  I have worked in some capacity  with each of these people and most I know quite well.

Bonnie:  Please forward to Michael Kirby.
I think the draft looks good.  Could you also prepare a draft of the letter we discussed yesterday to convey the proposal to the committee?

Attached is a draft Nonwaiver Agreement per our telephone conferences of yesterday after the meetings with Senator Dunn.  I am available in my office for a conference call to discuss this.

Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.  Most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.

Could you forward this to Palmer ... for some reason my address book doesn't pull him up when I'm off the system.

 

I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone.

Wanted you to be aware that Mayor Brown is inviting Jeff to meet with him, either in San Francisco or elsewhere.  Please advise, but I know that Jeff would probably not travel to California.

Mark Koenig and Andy Fastow will discuss meeting with Mayor Brown on the CalPERS issue.

Thanks,
Joannie

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City & County of San Francisco

Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.

Steve-

We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years.

I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts.

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like.  We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes.

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.  Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort.  Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded efforts.

What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy.

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time.

Thanks.

Mike

I'm glad things are moving forward.  I've talked with Dave briefly and will follow up with him again.

Please respond to kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net

Steve
 
As planned, I spoke with Jeff this morning.  It was a great call.  I am really excited about what is ahead.
 
We discussed the "title" issue.  I don't have any problems.  We should go with what is the best way to enter the organization.  
 
Jeff said he was going to touch base with Dave this morning to move the process forward.  I can't wait for my interviews and to join the team. 
 
Thanks for all of your help.
 
Kevin

Thanks for getting on top of this.  Please get the word out to the HR team leaders as soon as you know more.

Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.

I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will not be affected.

I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up immediately)

UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
Prudential (another option with internal connections)

let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Aaron

I'm still a junkie .... please email copies of the orders.

See last point:  MIT would like to talk to us about energy procurement and management.  Could you put someone in touch with them?
FYI -- He also responded back to Intellibridge accepting particpation in the Steering Committee.  What a nice guy!

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing=20

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and =
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreemen=
t with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure na=
tural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is=
 $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal an=
d state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast=
 of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. =
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas dis=
tribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as th=
e NNG system.=20
"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective=
 solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin," sai=
d Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Nort=
hern Natural Gas. "This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers=
 to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, e=
conomical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved."=
=20
"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still r=
ealize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market," sa=
id James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. "The purchase of the=
 Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost=
-efficient natural gas service to our customers."=20
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipe=
line from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile la=
teral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian P=
ipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the =
current Northern Natural pipeline.=20
"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers," said George =
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. "The Eagle line purchase by Wis=
consin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to bui=
ld the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better e=
nvironment for competition in the natural gas marketplace."=20
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for=
 regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new =
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. Th=
is new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be loca=
ted near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed durin=
g the construction of Guardian Pipeline.=20
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area capac=
ity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to uti=
lity customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximat=

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a furt=
her influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under p=
ressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex.=20
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from T=
hursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought tota=
l stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in ea=
rly trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slight=
ly in later trade.=20
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise,=
 in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large sh=
ort positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread,=
 which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures con=
tract will switch over to cash Monday.=20
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday.=20
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in th=
e near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery=
. The opposite situation is called contango.=20
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, =
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analy=
st with Barclays Capital in London.=20
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week.=20
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Do=
w Jones Industrial Average, dealers said.=20
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,=

However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and g=
eneral bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, =

On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the ben=

Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR26=
5/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade.=20
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well do=
wn on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing c=
ountries are also expected to fall.=20
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilsee=

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the=

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''

=09=09 Modern Metals, July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its atten=
tion to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Ind=
ustry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characte=
rize Enron as a "non-event." By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, =
and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word "Enron" in =
a room full of metals executives is like screaming "fire" in a crowded thea=
ter. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough=
 to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenue=
s of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a clai=
m (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"=
), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentat=
ion from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at th=
e SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treatin=
g their service center customers as "annoyances"), industry leaders rushed =
to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or p=
artner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggres=
sive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mil=
l executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are =
opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downr=
ight resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--st=
ill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying i=
s true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has genera=
ted would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Alt=
hough products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platf=
orm--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a =
formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, th=
e absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed in=
vestment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation,=
 and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's an=
swer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward=
 contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long produc=
ts are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. En=
ron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel transactions=
, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certa=
in grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be =
bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relat=
ionships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been off=
ering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. "Be=
fore you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be ab=
le to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," McMa=
hon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that." The=
 company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel c=
onsumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Her=
mans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.=
S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for =
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delive=
ry at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different=
 marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast=
 (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price=
 spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company=
 closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. "It's a big p=
ortfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply a=
nd demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term c=
ontracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the =
equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from som=
ebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. =
All of those combined is how we do our business." Steel mills can benefit, =
McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year "physical off take" with Enron,=
 thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specific=
ation. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and=
 use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whet=
her mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being=
 bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive pr=
ivately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chair=
man, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. "What we need =
to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make=
 a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and =
equipment," he stated. "I define true value as helping the industry to beco=
me stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility =
at $200 a ton." Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment i=
n a recent New Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $3=
20 [per ton], great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers=
 down your throat." For the service centers Service centers, McMahon sugges=
ted, could benefit immediately. "The only way [distributors] are able to he=
dge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," he explained. "That takes c=
apital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives th=
e exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. "We can hold=
 those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the servi=
ce centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somew=
hat certain." "I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industr=
y . . . " commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indian=
a. But he pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If =
they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of w=
hether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up=
 with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing f=
or some people and a non-event for others." Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed=
 out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service =
centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, "One of the terrib=
le things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term p=
ricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is=
 going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any =
one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals."  In a down market=
, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in =
orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude fro=
m customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reduct=
ions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings integrity to both =
sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very big plus for the=
 steel industry." But integrity, another Midwest service center exec counte=
red, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a prof=
iteering carpetbagger, "trying to make a buck in between the producer and t=
he user. That's all we need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to sq=
ueeze out a few more dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have=
 to deal with it." Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, =
indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducin=
g new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offend=
ed by somebody picking the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel marke=
t in the current economy. "What do you think the mills are going to do when=
 you come to them for just the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern w=
ould be that the price would go up on [those items]." McNeeley also questio=
ned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. =
"In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is a=
ccounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment," he rel=
ated. "Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company=
 surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distri=
butor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?" Only just begun Questions=
 abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As =
one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to deal wit=
h problems?" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supp=
lier, Dave Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficu=
lt to implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil siz=
es, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers=
 require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all i=
ssues that might complicate commodity sales." Delivery is another issue. As=
 a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery,=
 but as one service center source said, "the guarantee is good when the mat=
erial shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint=
 a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?" =
Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. "T=
hey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it=
 to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research a=
nd a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too =
much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar =
to the LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] t=
o start with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don=
't see that as the way the market will develop." McMahon has been consisten=
t in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer=
. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. "We know the=
 products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill =
or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. "It's not an 'if', it's=
 a 'when'." The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, a=
nd what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the de=
bate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic but=
ton. As Don McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a sp=
eech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and=
 he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now." =09

Jim and Ken --

Attached is an article for eBiz (our biweekly online newsletter), which we are scheduled to launch at 7:30 a.m. Friday.  Kelly Kimberly has reviewed it, but has asked that you view the article as well.  Since only EBS employees received your memo about the restructuring -- and the rest of the employees did not receive any communication -- it is extremely important to provide information through this vehicle.  

Please let me know of your approval or if you have any questions.  

Thank you.

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b=
ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to cr=
eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag=
ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg=
 relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi=
ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter=
connections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create=
 an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open =
transmission system.

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, =
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with t=

Enron Wholesale Services - Office of the Chairman

 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 
http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number.

I think this is an excellent letter.  I agree with Sue's comments and have included her changes on Page 3.  All changes have been marked in this version.

 

Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business.  Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings outlook,"  said Skilling.

My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading.

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday =
to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press =
reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in Sept=
ember, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The curren=
t document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly =
considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of=
 the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate enti=
ties.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable w=
ith the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibilit=
y for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect pri=
ces in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blen=
d the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that=
 is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industr=
y participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate disc=
rimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to a=
ct due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso=
 case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affect=
s the California market, both gas and power.=20

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a "Pat Wood" Commission=
 is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer =
community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  th=
at the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at t=
he affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting tha=
t he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Jo=
e Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community =
has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfort=
able with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a=
 lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Co=
mmissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits. =
=20

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranpor=
tation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our markete=
rs believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors=
 in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport c=
osts.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that m=
ore education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.

As discussed.

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

HERE IS THE MOST RECENT STATEMENT WITH STEVE'S COMMENTS.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

I love you.  Call me.

The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility an=
d then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why t=
hat makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most=
 efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competit=
ive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic reg=
ulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the =
business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relie=
d upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distrib=
ution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set p=
ricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a =
great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for =
lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign c=
ontributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policie=
s simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  =
The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relativ=
ely low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of=
 the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect t=
o rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any =
more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "re=
tailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Com=
petition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices a=
nd terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of =
service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign=
 contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the =
legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading=
 in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be =
perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents h=
ave a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's clai=
m of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exer=
cise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel=
 is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific =
reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxerc=
ise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we co=
uld suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a =
claim under such circumstances.

Has this previously been covered by the Office of the Chairman budget?  If so, please handle; otherwise let me know.
Steve --
 
A question aimed far below your pay grade.  Our most recent invoice to Enron (dating from April) has not yet been paid.  Our accountant, Paul Hart, reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to direct the invoices says he is no longer the appropriate person to approve it.
 
Any guidance on to whom we should turn?
 
All the best,
 
Nelson
Nelson:
 
We spoke to Enron's accounting dept who said that the invoice is still in their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices have been sent) said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The accountant asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your thoughts.

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site an=
d team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to=
 build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that=
 require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far=
 more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleague=
s might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire we=
ek for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Na=
turally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wro=
ng time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which comp=
ounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2=
, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the tra=
vel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international e=
mployees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be in=
cluded in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizat=
ions, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expe=
nses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff

(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In =
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform =
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the foll=
owing will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial an=
d non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must b=
e communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified=
 include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the =
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefe=
r that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that=
 is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work=
 is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to=
 justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So pleas=
e pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Federal price limits backfire=20
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps=20

01/07/04/MN186091.DTL =20
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal re=
gulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly impos=
ed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of bla=
ckouts in the two states.=20
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling black=
outs yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackout=
s in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduc=
e air conditioning.=20
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take =
a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revis=
ions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during s=
hortages.=20
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for t=
he California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of =
dollars to keep the state's lights on.=20
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.=20
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet =
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat=
es during periods of high demand.=20
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the ex=
pense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electrici=
ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said=
 Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e=
nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =
no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont=
rols are in effect.=20
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=
t having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."=20
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when =
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab=
out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, =
a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee=
s the state's power network.=20
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after=
 Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting=
 heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li=
ghts.=20
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=
t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th=
ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had=
 in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potenti=
al for unintended consequences."=20
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=
- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin=
g, under capped prices.=20
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=
2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because=
 of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=
ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.=
=20
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t=
hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal=
 regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit=
hhold output.=20
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"=
 said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=
 that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal r=
egulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let suppl=
y and demand determine costs.=20
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac=
k on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu=
mber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge=
ncies.=20
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."=20
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the com=
mission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for wh=
en the commission might come up with a response.=20

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, ge=
nerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state wa=
s nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the =
first time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
 table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
 uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy =
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for =
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=
=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca=
lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll=
ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia=
ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark=
et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p=
rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A=
nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap =
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind=
 of certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark=
ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s=
tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou=
ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=
ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=
lant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Indepen=
dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When =
there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=
ished during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=
rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent=
 of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=
ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=
ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=
ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou=
t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s=
ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev=
eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af=
ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su=
pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif=
ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat=
e's electricity since January.
     At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us t=
hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going=
 to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s=
ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m=
eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since =
May 31.
     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=
nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=
mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=
es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
 grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=
ntly drove away sellers, Hart said.
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
 the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=
ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=
 backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
 Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=
 of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =
a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=
ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=
en it should take effect. They got no answer.
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=
ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=
uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=
t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=
ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=
tely.
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =
had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in =
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr=
eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea=
ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this =
summer.
     "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said=

I am looking for some help in identifying the right person(s) at: Enron
Corp., for an introduction of our software solution.  Steven, if you could
take a moment and point me to the appropriate contact I would greatly
appreciate it.

Summary of eProvisioning:
 
eProvisioning radically improves people's Time-To-Productivity by
transforming the disparate activities that allocate IT resources to people
into a secure and automatic process. Once provisioned, these resources
remain digitally connected to each person as they move through the business
cycle and are dynamically updated as necessary. At the appropriate time,
they are systematically, securely and automatically removed.  

Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and access
complete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one,
and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave.
In addition, by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities,
organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise,
and better respond to emerging market requirements. 

eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability to
quickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of the
eProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and tracking
capabilities. As business relationships between organizations expand,
Business Layers technology provides the framework for integration and
interoperability between eProvisioning partners - suppliers and service
providers, devices and applications - which are the digital foundations of
the Internet economy. 

Please, if you could give me a few minutes of your valuable time or guide me
to the right person to describe the significant benefits of what we offer."

Guys, we have a unique capability at this time (ie) me in EES and Greg in EWS to have a singular voice in the regulatory market.  I would recommend a policy committee be formed including Greg, Dave, Janet Dietrich, John Lavorato, Tim Belden, Kevin Presto, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean that meets on a regular basis to review and approve our regulatory agenda, policy and tactical moves on a regular basis.

Thoughts.....?

I know we got a lot of grief on the Hill when we had our fight with UC/CSU.  Now we have settled and this release will go out (with some modification) today.
Attached is a draft of the UC-CSU-Enron press release concerning the settlement agreement.  Please review and let me know of any revisions or suggestions.  We would like for this to go out tomorrow if possible.  We're still waiting for a quote from CSU.  I'll make sure you see that as well.  Thank you.  Max

  

Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings?

Attached is a draft of the UC-CSU-Enron press release concerning the settlement agreement.  Please review and let me know of any revisions or suggestions.  We would like for this to go out tomorrow if possible.  We're still waiting for a quote from CSU.  I'll make sure you see that as well.  Thank you.  Max

  

Has this gone to Ken yet.  If not please send.

This is the new "Final" version.  The difference from the earlier version is - a few slides were taken out and the order of the remaining slides were rearranged.

Please get a copy of this new "Final" to Ken Lay.  

Thanks.

This is the final version, including the changes Jeff just requested.

 

Ursula

per my voicemail
Just in case you wanted a copy too.

Please see the attached.

 

Sorry for the delay (I had major e-mail problems).  The memo looks good; let's get it out.

 		

Steve,
As you know, we have developed a memo to be signed by Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling reaffirming our EEO, Harassment Prevention and Fair Treatment policies for 2001.  The final version is attached for your review, and if acceptable, to obtain the needed signatures.  

The memo has been reviewed by Cindy, the Legal Department and the OLER group.  Once signatures have been obtained, return the signed memo to me so that our group can begin the distribution and posting of the memo to all US employees.  

Please call me at x37921 if you have any questions.  The signed memo can be sent to me at EB1669c.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

 

Regards,
Sandra

Yes, Phillippe left to join a firm in New York -- I don't know who.

Steven,
I hear Philippe is leaving for Putnam, any truth to this?  I've been unable
to contact him directly.  Thanks in advance.

The California Chamber of Commerce received a call from someone at the
CPUC who requested that they send as many customers as possible to
testify at Tuesday's hearing in favor of direct access.   The Chamber
has requested the same thing of Enron.

Rep Scott McGinnis (colo) told Ken that he would like to be briefed on the California and broader energy situation so that he can speak out on the issue.
Also, don't forget that we need to go see your buddy Newt!

Here is the slide presentation we were talking about this morning.

Steve,

Good talking to you again today.  Here are the slides based on my 
(mis?)interpretation of Teresa Amabile's work that I presented in April.  I 
think it would be great to get her to speak at your management conference.

  =20
=09Subject:        17/7 - 7:00 p.m. - Update: Emergency=20

=09The situation continues to be stable.  CLHB has reinitated LPG operation=
s to LaPaz, but continue their inspection.  TR will not reinitiate gas or c=
rude export operations until we have completed our inspection.  We have for=
med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.  It=
 could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we =
get a progress report in the morning.   All crews available systemwide are =
mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority co=
ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano.  The three stations in the altipl=
ano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.  Other supervisors throughou=
t the system have been advised and are on alert.

=09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and =
inspection action plan.  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (t=
he regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute ene=
rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz=
's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in=
spection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L=
aPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide =
only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

=09We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received =
inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia=
ns this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system=
.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to th=
e volatility of the issue in LaPaz.  Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed w=
ith the message.

=09We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack=
 should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.  =
In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a=
 notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s=
afely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne=
cessary.

=09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol=
utionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.  Morales has had co=
ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we'=
re still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, o=
r if it is against government.  Morales has just joined forces with another=
 rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro=
w.  Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as=
 a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, proba=
bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.  The po=
litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int=
erests looking to fill the leadership void.  We're watching this situation =
closely.  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for =
at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational si=
tuation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

=09At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li=

 have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had=
 a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  Th=
e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediat=

=09However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 day=

will notify the Enron Crisis team.

=09We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized =
a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw=

No change.  The plan is to make the changes effective 1.01.02.  We need to discuss the communication of the changes.  My recollection from one of our earlier conversations is that this is considered a benefit change and therefore must be communicated.  Is that right?  Is it all employees or only US based?

I am finalizing the severance plan restatement document for the August 13 Comp Committee and Board meeting.  Can you confirm that the changes approved by the Policy Committee are still intended for rollout effective 1/1/2002 with communications to employees during our rollout of 2002 benefit plan changes?

Steve,

Please see attached a background note and update relating to the LME fine issued to Enron Metals.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or would like any further information on this.

Regards

Julie Green

 

I have a question related to your former responsibilities:  As you know Terry Thorn had significant involvement in the IGU (I believe he is still Chairman).  With his retirement (eff Aug 1) he is asking Ken Lay about the possibility of continuing on behalf of Enron.  My inclination is to simply resign the Chairmanship, but there are other options: let Terry continue (I think I know your view on that), or replace Terry with another Enron person.  What do you think?

Call at 5:00 today (3:00 your time), if you can.

Steve
 
Good news.  As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week.  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership.  She explored my views about doing business with government.  Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26.  
 
Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16.  In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday.  (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.)
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet?
 
Thank you for your all of your help.  I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.  
 
Kevin

Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.

Good afternoon-

I have pulled the information that you requested and the attached document outlines the findings.  Per your request, the data compiled is a sampling of soft money donations for the 1998-2002 cycle for the Energy, Financial, and Pharmaceutical industries.  This was ready for you last night, but I decided to dig a little deeper and have provided additional data that you may find useful.

I looked at the specific industry for the companies that you requested and then I backed up to the "Overview" for the industry.

In "The Center for Responsive Politics" website, the "Top Recipients" are based on contributions from PACs, soft money donors, and individuals giving $200 or more. Due to the voluminous nature of the Top Recipients listed, I printed them out and they are available for your perusal.  On the spreadsheet, I continued the analysis on the Top Recipients and what was donated, in the election cycles 1998 - 2000, across the 3 industries.   Because you asked for a combination of Oil & Gas Companies and Electric Utilities, I showed Electric Utilities and Oil & Gas data, separately and then combined.  

Numbers that are listed in "bold" indicate the group who had the largest donations within each research area.  The split on the "Top Presidential Democrat and Republican Candidates" are calculated from the "Overview of Sectors '98 - '00".

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

 
Thanks!

Please pull information on the soft money federal contributions by the following organizations:

Duke
Dynegy
Mirant
Southern
Williams

Various financial institutions

Eli Lilly and other pharmaceuticals

We're interested in their overall spend, their party split, and the individual candidates they're contributing to.

Thanks.

I take your point, but to clarify my intent in gathering this information: I'm not making the case for a different "tilt" to our giving; I was looking for information about the total giving (including individuals) by companies which share a common viewpoint and may face some of the same risks that we face if the democrats continue their runaway campaign of corporation bashing.  Pharmaceuticals were included because Ken sits on Lilly's board and wanted a closer look at that sector.  Ken asked for the information because he is at least thinking about making an appeal to the business community to send some of the same strong messages we are beginning to send.

I'm not sure of the context of your Email to Ken, but I wanted to emphasize one point on the data you've put together.   The Center for Responsible Politics' numbers include individual contributions.  Thus, if you look at Enron's so-called split, under their analysis Enron splits its $ much for favorably for Republicans than in the numbers underpinning the pie charts contained in the material I distributed.  Unlike the Center's numbers, my charts do not reflect giving by individuals working at Enron.  Most of our individual $, which is significant, is given to Republicans.  Consequently, as I understand the history of our giving, part of our thinking on splitting soft $ is to offset the overwhelming individual $ given to Republicans.   One last thought is that I understand the split recommended in our proposed budget  is much more Republican than it has been in past years.  Hope this helps.

Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).

Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of "spot" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.

We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.  

RA

We are verifying the below numbers but believe this to be in the ballpark. We have a huge challenge to undertake the follow-up here over the next 3 weeks.

I made some modifications, but we may want to make more ... I think we need to emphasoze the reasonableness of our offer.  The audience should be redefined as the Senators, not just the members of the committee.  Let's discuss.

 

Thanks for your interest.  We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message.

Hi,

I would like to participate on the Employee PRC Committee. I am an analyst who has been at Enron for two years. I have recently come out of a group where I think the PRC process has been misapplied not only to me but many others. I think there is too much "smoke" in this process, especially at the analyst level where we don't participate in PRC meetings even at the group level. I have many other concerns about the current process that could have me typing away here for the next hour , so please consider including me in this.

Thanks,

Avinash Jain

JoAnn Hill is on vacation; I'll look into it.

Steve

I still haven't received an explanation.

Ken

Could you please provide Ken and I with the explanation

--Steve- Did you get my earlier email re: this last week?

Ken

I found out at a meeting last Wednesday from an employee of another department that my title had changed from Manager to Sr. Specialist in the Expertfinder. I returned to the office and found this to be true. I called Joann Hill in Corporate HR and met with her on Friday. She advised me that there had been a study which re-classified several of us on EPSC. We were not informed prior to this happening. I was further frustrated because when I was transitioned to this department in April . I met with Bill Donovan and Lou Casari and was told that nothing would change about my title or responsibilities. EBS would be my primary client and I would be charged back 100%. When I was transferred my team was assigned to managers already in the department. I was not told that my title was in jeopardy. I am still responsible for Julie Stockham as a report in Portland although she is in Phillip Lord' s cost center. Joann was very gracious and agreed to investigate and let me know.

This is a setback I had not anticipated especially after John Echols ad advised me I was next for promotion

Thanks for your support.

Ken -- the process description (i.e. where Brown could play a key role) is discussed in the middle of the update document.

Rosalee:

Attached are the materials that Steve asked me to send you to forward to Mr. Lay.  Thanks very much for your help.

Best,
Jeff

  

Ken is talking to Willie Brown today.  He will encourage him to get involved as a facilitator for a comprehensive solution to the California problem.  Ken would like to have the following information to provide Brown perhaps next week:

Listing of who is owed how much in California
Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists
Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.

The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this.

See attached.

Just fyi -- Amabile did not present to Enron management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting.  Some of her work was presented by her colleague and Enron Advisory Council member -- Pankaj Ghemewat.

Professor Amabile,

I work for Enron, a leading energy company based in Houston.  I believe you recently presented some of your research on creativity and motivation to members of our management team.  I am responsible for preparing the business agenda for Enron's annual Management Conference.  Scheduled in San Antonio on November 15-16, the two-day meeting brings together more than 400 Enron executives.

Enron has been named most innovative company for six consecutive years by Fortune magazine.  However, this year has been challenging for the company.  External market issues and internal restructurings have resulted in a depressed stock price and low moral among employees.  

Your insights on creating a motivating work environment and stimulating innovation would be especially interesting at this year's conference.  If you are interested in presenting to our group, I'd like to explore your availability the morning of Friday, November 16.

Please feel free to respond to my email or call me at 713-853-7727.  I look forward to hearing from you.

	As a valued member of the RFF Council, we thought you might
appreciate knowing that Resources for the Future President Paul Portney
has been asked to appear on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" this Wednesday
(August 15th) between 8am and 9am for a live, hour-long interview.

	It is a unique and unprecedented opportunity to enlighten a
national television audience about RFF itself - its mission, research,
history and future goals, much of which you have helped to support.

	C-SPAN's request for the interview followed intense media
coverage of Dr. Portney's work chairing the National Academy of Sciences
committee on fuel economy standards, and Katherine Probst's
widely-reported study on the future costs of Superfund.

	You can also access the interview online at www.c-span.org and

I wrote some comments last night.  Maureen will fax this am.  As you will see, I have some deep concerns about the story -- content and the prudence of doing such a story.

Steve, you may be aware that we are featuring an article on the PRC process in the Enron Business that we're editing now. The issue is due to be published in two weeks.

Karen has made her comments on the story; I'd appreciate hearing what you have to say.

I haven't reviewed the story yet with HR (David Oxley is my contact).I've made sure that the story is balanced, accurate and fair. My fear is that HR will not want us to publish any negative comments on the process. If so, I think they would be overlooking an effective and credible method of communicating why the PRC process is so important to how Enron does business. 

Sarah has already discussed with Beth Tilney that we will publish another article in the next issue when the Culture Committee's recommendations on PRC are fully developed and ready to be implemented. 

We are working on a tight deadline, and I suspect the  review process will be lengthy. I hope you can return it sometime Monday.

Thanks,
Jeannie

Jeannie, et al -- I like this story.  I think it's very balanced, but very long.  Is there any way to break out a sidebar? Like maybe the PRC process -- what it's like in the room.  See my edits --- there are some holes, and i think it's too long on the anecdotes and quotes.  I'd like Steve to take a look at it.  Let me know if I can do more to help. thx. kd

Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

See below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.

here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
pollster for President Bush:

Gray Davis

FAV             48
UNFAV	       44

STRONG UNFAV     28
STRONG FAV          15

RIGHT TRACK         34
WRONG TRACK      49

DAVIS  		40
RIORDAN          39

Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
situation politically.	

I left a message.  Ken has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys.

Steve, I gave this fellow your phone number if he decides to call.  Would you like me to route these somewhere else?  It was all I could think of late last evening.  (I should have already forwarded our phones to voicemail!).

Rosie

Ken,

Rosa Lee indicated that e-mail would be a great way to initially communicate
with you regarding the announcement during the Astros pre-game show that
your CEO stepped down today.

When you are ready to evaluate your options to staff the position, my CEO
and I would like to meet with you to discuss Allen Austin Lowe & Powers'
capabilities to do a thorough retain search for this position.  Two salient
points are: 1) We have filled 100% of our retained searches, and  2) We
guarantee our candidates for one year.

Allen Austin Lowe & Powers has done work for Enron in the past and is
located here in Houston.

I can be reached on my direct line listed below or on my cell at (281)
923-4563.

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (=
"Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str=
ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  =
He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and=
 the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer=
ely to entertain.

=09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f=
ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy=
 the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl=
y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make=
 choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i=
ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically=
, the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity=
 market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a=
ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t=
he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange=
les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand=

kets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are =

Steve, Joe Andreis markets a computer technology curriculum for grades k-8.  The cost of the materials for the teacher is normally $50 but they will let Enron buy it for $35 and put it in the classes/schools of our choice (and they will put our name on the material).  We are using this curriculum at the Sidney Gutierrez Charter Middle School and it is great.  Can you forward this to the right Enron person so that I can investigate Enron's possible support of this? thanks.

Leslie,
 
Just a short note to reiterate my efforts in  finding a company that would purchase and place the TechnoExplorers  curriculum into schools across the country as a public relations effort and sign  of good corporate citizenry in promoting education in the areas the company has  business operations.
 
I realize that only a brief overview was discussed  last evening.  I was glad to hear that Steve is considering focusing on  education.  I can put together all the necessary information that  explains the curriculum, the price, professional development training for  educators and other items of interest.  Let me know what you think.   
 
Thanks,
 
Joe

OK if I forward this to Billy Lemmons, or does he already have it?

I think #90 might be at the heart of the matter.  If we kept the class size=
 smaller, we could be more selective, pay more for the higher quality talen=
t, make more meaningful assignments, and provide for a more active mentorin=
g and development program.

Steve the comment compilation is a laundry list.  I think that some of them=
 are completely out of sync and unjustified but others are real and many re=

time to answer.  The happy ones might just have passed on this one. =20

I hope you find them relevant and/or useful. =20

I was told that William Lemons of the associate program saw this list a cou=

rent associates and the offers were higher for this year ?s summer associat=

 << File: AA_Program_Comments.doc >>=20

Comments from MBA Class 2000

1.=09We need to reconcile the difference between ENE's salaries vs competit=
ors' and other Houston companies.

2.=09We need better guidance in the rotation selection (I've seen lot of go=
od people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of =
information).

3.=09Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not, the Program itsel=
f is staffed in a very amateur manner.  There are a few really good people =
but for the most part it is just not professionally run.  Calls unanswered,=
 lots of passing the buck, and general disorganization.

4.=09If they have resources, they do a poor job of communicating them.  Whi=
le we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves, there should be an a=
ctive effort to point us to those resources.

5.=09Compensation.  The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being l=
ocked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance.  At =
the very least, this is a serious oversight. =20

6.=09PRC.  Really doesn't work.  Not an apple to apples comparison.  Heavil=
y dependent on when/where you rotated.

7.=09I could care less about Enron's reputation.  I tried paying my student=
 loans with "reputation" but they only accepted cash.  How much money can I=
 make at this place assuming the stock price doesn't double every few month=
s, in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay=
 my compensation? =20

8.=09Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term=
s of the PRC, where before Enron was penalizing the "have issues" classific=
ation of the PRC, now it feels like they are trying to get rid of 20% of th=
e pool. Reinforcing the first paragraph.

9.=09Offer of salary is cloaked and we don't know where we can end up.

10.=09I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h=
ead office. As a result, the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e=
xpectations. And obviously when those expectations are not met, we all know=
 the consequences.

11.=09The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much high=
er base

12.=09Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against?  I=
s it really Wall Street and consulting?  If so, I'd like to see the names o=
f the firms.  New York is not that expensive that the "well they're in New =
York" excuse covers all discrepancies.  It feels like we must be benchmarki=
ng against second or third tier MBA recruiters.

13.=09There's a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a s=
ecure, established, money making division in order to guarantee a average o=
r above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom =
brackets and not be fired.  That goes against the long- term reputation of =
Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks.=20

14.=09Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro=
tating but do not expect to get displaced by a 1st rotation associate that =
is placed by the AA pool.

15.=09Assignment of 1st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was=
 more of an analyst function than it was an associate function.  Why can't =
alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the=
 in coming candidate?

16.=09Manage expectations...don't need to hear about 26 year old trader and=
 Louise Kitchen's rise to fame with Enron Online...creates an expectation t=
hat those are more common occurrences than they really are.

17.=09It doesn't feel like there's a lot to do in all areas, nonetheless so=
mething between 60 and 100 new associates coming in these fall: First, why =
that many?  Second, do they know what they are getting into?

18.=09The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market =
- we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up =
for the disparity, but given the declining stock value, lack of meaningful =
rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra=
m this is becoming a much bigger issue.

19.=09Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea wha=
t the upside looks like.  Working for beans in year 1 is ok if years 2-5 ar=
e excellent.  We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft=
er the program is over.

20.=09Salary well below market (base salary and value of options/bonus) - e=
ven if they bring us up to the 2001 offers (which are rumored to be under m=
arket), we have 1 year or more experience with the class coming in and will=
 be paid the same amount?

21.=09Lack of quality rotations (cuts in EBS, EES, ect...)

22.=09Level of responsibility is well below expectations/maturity level

23.=09Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top=
 B-Schools.  Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting, but also compared=
 to specialties (brand management, etc.) that are at the lower end of the M=
BA scale.  It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not i=
ndexed by location.  Other energy companies here in town even pay more. =20

24.=09The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no=
t carrots.  There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of=
 a signing bonus 18 months after the start date.  If the Program is truly s=
pecial people should not be forced to repay anything-Enron should deliver w=
hat they advertise and people will stay.  The 18-month lock up period sugge=
sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associ=
ate and not an improvement in the Program.=20

25.=09How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe=
rformance levels?  I've got no clue but I'm wondering why it such a big sec=
ret?=20

26.=09The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota=
tions as Enron implies.  For example, if you take a rotation in an area you=
 know nothing about, you will lose in the PRC because you are still learnin=
g the job.  Similarly, if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation, y=
ou will be rewarded a PRC time.

27.=09There are too many associates and too few analysts.   Too many associ=
ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do.  Too often, asso=
ciates think to themselves, I remember doing this several years ago as an u=
ndergrad, why am I doing this again.

28.=09They should present the program for what it is -an internal labor poo=
l where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available =
and who they know.  The Program does not match people with jobs and should =
make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs, etc upon entry into t=
he program.  This is not because they want Associates to have choice, but r=
ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations=
. =20

29.=09If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting=
, we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors.  I don't k=
now what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not k=
eeping up.  Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra=
m.  When a person who didn't get into Enron but got into a competitor makes=
 materially more money from the start, people start believing they have jus=
t been sold a lot of hype.

30.=09Not enough development during rotations - even associates who end up =
learning a lot don't necessarily enjoy their rotations because they don't f=
eel part of the team

31.=09Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir=
st rotation is a moral buster as well.  Additionally, it can waste a lot of=
 time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have=
 no interest in.

32.=09Compensation - many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba=
se and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised l=
arge equity based compensation.  Also, it was very difficult to find out wh=
at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process.  Most wrongl=
y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth=
er leading MBA avenues.  How much money do people at Enron make assuming th=
e stock price performs1. Great 2. Okay, 3. Poor? =20

33.=09Responsibility - when you are getting recruited you always here the L=
ouise Kitchen, John Arnold, and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal.=
  We need to stop doing that.  Enron's slowing growth rate and failure in e=
verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we=
 look more and more like a large corporation. =20

34.=09The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let =
them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out.  I=
f this is true, why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f=
ewer, higher quality associates from the start - the process of weeding out=
 leaves everyone with a bad feeling.  More importantly, you probably lose m=
ore good people then you realize.

35.=09Trading, trading, trading.  On MBA campus visits, Enron gives the imp=
ression that there are lots of corporate development & M&A, finance, and ot=
her similar assignments available at Enron.  The reality seems that if you =
are not interested in trading for a living, you are not on the company's ma=
in commercial track any longer.

36.=09Finding a Rotation: Information difficult to get; it is all networkin=
g. This is fine, but I don't consider the A/A progrram a resource in this a=
rea at all. If no one else does, we should cut any expenses they are incurr=
ing for "rotation placement".

37.=09The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale.  You can reward the high =
performers without penalizing the good performers.  Recently, the word has =
gotten around =09that the top 5% and the next 15% of the PRC group got very=
 large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses?  This=
 distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb=
er of unhappy people.

38.=09"I find it interesting that Enron chooses to 1- adopt a business mode=
l based upon free-market economics, and 2- pride itself on its intellectual=
 capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv=
ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence.  In sel=
ecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point.  I find it paradoxical, h=
owever, that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc=
ribed as socialistic, and below market.  In a labor market where intellectu=
al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive =
advantage in the form of this asset, I can only believe that Enron is posit=
ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J. Aron, Morgan Stanl=
ey, Dynegy, El Paso, etc. decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on En=
ron is to higher this intellectual capital.  Without griping, I feel if not=
hing else, workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen=
ts we possess.  In our "sales pitch" we are told that Enron benchmarks pay =
against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street.  =
I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand=
le to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package, which leaves me bi=
tter that the sales pitch was shallow, fell short, or was deliberately misg=
uided.  Part of the problem, from an Associates perspective, stems from Enr=
on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery.  Like a company t=
hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market, punishment for such a s=
hortfall is swift and severe.  I truly believe Enron is setting itself up f=
or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly.

39.=09In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an=
d socialistic patronage, I have come to notice that more and more departmen=
ts are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the A=
ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months.  Fu=
rther, many desks, once happy with the performance of the Associate, ask fo=
r the "option" to retain the Associate.  However, no effort is made to comp=
ensate the Associate for essentially giving up the "optionality" embedded i=
n a rotational program.  In fact, many choosing to stay within a group have=
 made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time, they=
 have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o=
pting to join a unit full time.  By removing the ability of business units =
to promote a worker until conclusion of the 18-24 month period, hard workin=
g, good-fit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see=
m to be a natural fit for a full-time position, and the chance to alleviate=
 a significant source of discontent-COMPENSATION- which could be addressed =
through the immediate promotion to the Manager level.  By allowing for prom=
otion, Associates could earn enhanced compensation, and department heads co=
uld address hiring needs.  Rather, Associates leave a unit disgruntled, fee=
ling they are marking time in other units, potentially passing up an altern=
ative that may be of great interest.  Additionally, a number of Commercial =
units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are =
in their third or fourth rotation, so as to retain a "call option" on an em=
ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives.  This practice CANNOT be =
in the best interest of the Desks, the Program, or for that matter Enron.  =
By pigeonholing employees in this matter, the significance and importance o=
f rotations is greatly diminished, as is our work experience.  This is just=
 ludicrous!  Department heads aren't looking to hire externally because of =
the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade.  Rather, they are trying to =
plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary.  Again, rather than=
 pay a competitive, performance-based wage, Enron has adopted a tight-fiste=
d, socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses.  Ultimately, this will l=
ead to people seeking to "rotate" out of Enron for the compensation the mar=
ket will bare.  =20

40.=09I think A/A provides an excellent opportunity to find the department =
that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job, =
chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates, than for =
regular employees.

41.=09We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go - I doubt many=
 of the guys who went to NY had this.

42.=09We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce=
.

43.=09Salaries: Not in line with market.

44.=09Mentors: Not encouraged throughout the organization.=20

45.=09Recruiting: Disorganized, not enough student focus, trying to compete=
 with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries, sometimes unprofess=
ional conduct (rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and =
gave message 'you are not good enough').

46.=09Summer Intern Program: Not well coordinated.=20

47.=09Rotation Length: Keep flexibility. 6 mos sometimes too short (other t=
imes too long); disincents management to include Associates in longer term/=
meatier projects.

48.=09When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited?

49.=09Overall, Enron has a great group of people to work with.

50.=09Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds, ethnicity, and natio=
nalities within the company.

51.=09Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere

52.=09Overall, Enron has an excellent overall company image

53.=09I do not have too many comments. My main problem with the last team w=
as that they were extremely rigid - rigid start date, rigidity in assigning=
 groups, etc. Old group did one-way dialogues, they would not even listen. =
The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen - these are two thi=
ngs I feel are most important in running such program.

54.=09Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friend=
s that graduated with me from my business school.  They wanted (still want)=
 to work for Enron. I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res=
ponse (I believe she left Enron). I then contacted Patricia Payton. Several=
 emails, phone calls and still haven't heard from her. It's frustrating dea=
ling with the HR dept.

55.=09PRC is not a trusted mechanism.  Few people in the program understand=
 it fully, no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings, and no one bel=
ieves the results are truly equitable.  Politics appears to play as much of=
 a role as performance, if not more so, in determining rankings.  Further, =
groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r=
anked people.  For as much as individuals' success depends upon this rankin=
g, and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be, that policy=
 is incredibly inconsistent.

56.=09We are under market for compensation - everyone knows this, regardles=
s of what the program people say.  It is common knowledge that at least Rel=
iant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b=
onus.  The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin=
g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl=
at and was not well received (obviously).

57.=09Rotation placement service is not very useful.  The best way to find =
a good rotation remains through networking.

58.=09The experience, talent, and character of the associate pool continue =
to be excellent.

59.=09Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with =
virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing.  Comeraderie a=
mong the class is widespread and genuine.

60.=09The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A=
/A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d=
irection.

61.=09Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in=
ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea=
te new networks between individual associate classes.  Efforts by individua=
l associates to affect this have not been supported.

62.=09Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered, =
particularly as rotation time approaches.  This would facilitate informal d=
iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity.  Additionally it =
would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota=
tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers.

63.=09Compensation is clearly an issue.  Whether the compensation gap exist=
s in reality or it only exists in perception, there is a widespread belief =
that Enron is under-compensating associates relative to both other firms in=
 the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a=
re employed.  This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel=
y underwater options.  Base salary should be addressed.

64.=09Again, whether perception or reality, associates are concerned about =
selecting rotations in groups that are not making money.  The belief is tha=
t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units.  The=
refore, it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro=
up, regardless of the skill development it may offer.

65.=09The mandatory eighteen-month service period before eligibility for pr=
omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers.

66.=09What happened to the A/A publication?

67.=09There is no source available that provides a history of individual as=
sociates who have rotated through specific jobs.  It would be very benefici=
al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for first-hand =
information on business units of interest.

68.=09My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot=
 of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons=
ibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into t=
he group.  Once in, I know of several people including myself that get a wh=
ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations=
 prior to joining that group.  Furthermore, I believe that Associates get w=
ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr=
ee.  This is very frustrating because once your in, your in and you can't g=
et out for 6 months.  On top of that, you get PRC reviews based on work tha=
t was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assess=
ment can be made. =20

69.=09Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon=
e.  But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up=
front with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate.  In addition=
, it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very, very poorly by=
 their new groups.  This has not been the case for me, but I know people th=
at have voiced these thoughts and opinions - so I am speaking for them inca=
se they are too nervous to put it into writing.

70.=09That is about it.  I would like to see some education come out of the=
 Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron, as well as som=
e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations.

71.=09When Enron recruited us, it was so different from what it is now.  So=
 many diverse opportunities were out there.  Now, Enron is heading towards =
a pure trading house.  It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota=
tion out of trading.  But you don't need an MBA to be a trader!  In fact, A=
ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side, and we don't have an=
y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi=
ng side.  It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about "getting the n=
ext rotation at El Paso".

72.=09A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly, and=
 six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first, and =
then make meaningful contributions.  Some people think it is worthwhile to =
groom Associates, even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts, who are =
supposed to be there longer.  It is sometimes difficult for Associates to g=
et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us.

73.=09Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit=
ors.

74.=09The company's direction has changed drastically from the one I interv=
iewed for in November 2000, some of these strategies seem shortsighted and =
in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th=
e energy business in the long term; specifically:

75.=09The stated strategy of exiting all generation, exploration, and trans=
portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa=
ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street.  Also, with additional pl=
ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way, how can we expect =
to continue to grow and maintain our current market share?

76.=09Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures;=
 including Azurix, Enron International, Dabhol, EBS, and EES.  The failures=
 of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b=
een totally priced in to our stock price.  Bottom line; there does not appe=
ar to be any large areas of growth within the company.

77.=09Pay! When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from 25,0=
00 to 40,000 dollars more to do the same job; it doesn't make you feel very=
 intelligent to be working here.  Additionally, when I accepted this positi=
on I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and=
 what the determinants are of the annual bonus.  What I have heard through =
the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to beli=
eve during recruiting.  Not having any assistance and having attended a top=
 East coast school, I am almost $100,000 dollars in debt.  I was counting o=
n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck=
, but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I w=
orked as an engineer in manufacturing.

78.=09I don't see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analys=
ts and Associates. It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salari=
es, but it is also a waste of "years of experience" in the case of Associat=
es.  It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the P=
rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units. Be certai=
n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associ=
ate.

79.=09If you look at A/A as human capital, we at Enron are very long in bac=
kground, experience and knowledge. The A/A Program is "Regulation" using En=
ron terminology: from rotation assignments, to payments. I see pretty logic=
al the consequences: a lot of inefficiencies, waste of energy, the lack of =
objectivity, poor motivation or even frustration, in general performance is=
 far away from excellent. Add some flexibility to the Program: let the peop=
le choose their rotations and move without restrictions. Let them also nego=
tiate working conditions, salaries, and career path with the business unit.

80.=09PRC is unfair. I consider offensive writing in a maximum of 5 lines 6=
 months of accomplishments. I don't think a PRC Committee can better assess=
 the performance than the business unit. 360-degree evaluations, and peers =
review are ok.  Re-think the need of a committee and a ranking of A/A assig=
ned to so different business units.

81.=09I feel free to choose for a second rotation. I like the way you can a=
pproach a new business unit, introduce yourself, have an interview and gath=
ered information about the business and your position. Things may change af=
ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least 6 months. Keep allo=
wing people to search and move freely from HR.

82.=09Make staff more accountable.  Online based.  Much like the IT departm=
ent, where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure =
of with any comments.

83.=09Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Man=
ager.  Not communicated at all.

84.=09Tell people that their first rotations are assigned.  Also not commun=
icated.

85.=09I wish I had a PRC suggestion, but I need to think about it.

86.=09Don't insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money=
 but putting it in a bonus so you don't have to give us raises.  If you wan=
t to do that, give me the courtesy of being up front about it.

87.=09Some kind of database (maybe there is one that I don't know about) of=
 openings.  Would be pretty cool.

88.=09Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors - at the =
least so it is equal.

89.=09Make the development and support of associates a more important crite=
rion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents.  The commer=
cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely

90.=09Reduce the size of each incoming class - make the program special aga=
in.  Right now, I can't believe the broad spread in ability and experience =
in the associate class.  I guarantee the spread is not that high in other t=
op tier firms that hire MBAs.

91.=09With the smaller size, assign a lead commercial person to a group of =
5 associates.  The lead commercial person (a director or VP) would keep in =
touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the =
most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them

92.=09Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these =
groups know when they need a clerk, analyst, or associate.  Too often we tr=
eat analysts, clerks, and 30-year-old associates with 6-8 years of experien=
ce the same.  This happens way too much.

93.=09The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer =
to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they =
want to take and design a plan on how to get them there.

We recommended this to Ken and I believe he is very willing.  Should be coordinated with Greg Whalley and John Lavorato

What do you think?

Hello Mr. Lay,

My name is Larry May, I trade the nat gas pipe options book and report to John Arnold.  I have a suggestion:  due to the volatility in the market Thursday, most of us missed the all employee meeting Thursday.  I think it would be a good morale booster if we had an open meeting on the trade floor.  Thank you.

Respectfully,

=09Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its mana=

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (=
"Enron Goes Overboard" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a str=
ing of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  =
He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and=
 the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks mer=
ely to entertain.

=09The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the f=
ree market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy=
 the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparentl=
y rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make=
 choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the i=
ntegrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically=
, the example Krugman cites of "financialization" run amok (the electricity=
 market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with a=
ctive government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in t=
he entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Ange=
les, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squand=
ered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by mar=
kets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are =
doomed to repeat such mistakes.

David, please forward to the appropriate person.

Good afternoon Mr Kean,

The reason for contacting you today is that I am currently working a senior
US executive based in the UK.  I am confident he could prove to be a
valuable asset to the Enron Corporation.

Currently residing in London, he is now looking to make a career move which
will utilise his honed management style, and experience of developing
commercial business.  

At the moment he is the Group Managing Director of Europe's largest Telecoms
Support business which has a turnover in excess of ?1 billion.

You were in a meeting yesterday evening,  but I wanted to investigate
whether you would like to see a narrative profile of this gentleman.

Your initial thoughts would be most welcome, I look forward to hearing from
you at your convenience.

kind regards,
Darren Walsh

Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.

Steve, can you suggest an answer to these questions?  Thanks

Mr. Skilling consistently stated over the past few months that we needed to "earn our way" to a higher stock price.  Following his departure, Mr. Lay has stated that one of his top priorities would be to rebuild our stock value.  My question is, will the company have any changes to existing policies in order to facilitate this growth?  Will company spending (Teaming events, Travel and Expense Policy, Investment in new technology, and so on) be cut back in order to bolster earnings?  Basically, do we have a new gameplan (aside from the EBS restructuring) or will we proceed forward and operate as we have been.

Thanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  Mark, Jeff and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.  Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with Jeff and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by Ken's obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here.
I'm sure you have heard this from lots of people - you guys did an amazing job handling this
issue from the beginning.  All communication was well orchestrated - external and internal!!
I'm especially proud to read this article.  This is the Enron I know and love - honest, open, human
and smart!!   I'm not sure if you guys advised Jeff or if he spoke so candidly on his own - either
way it was a great job.  Thanks!!!

Enron's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge
As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post
By John R. Emshwiller

08/16/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s
plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday
as the energy giant's chief executive officer after only about six
months in the job.

   In an interview yesterday, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on
his decision to leave Houston-based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling
insisted he had resigned for "personal reasons" unrelated to Enron's
business activities.
   In the interview, he reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to
resign from the company's board or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed
the CEO's duties at the nation's biggest energy trader.

   However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his "personal reasons" were
deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business
area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company's stock
performance a "kind of ultimate score card," Mr. Skilling noted that
Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.

   Mr. Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally. "I
put a lot of pressure on myself" for that decline, he said. "I felt I
must not be communicating well enough" with investors. He felt this
particularly given Enron's strong financial results over the past
several quarters, based largely on growing volumes in its trading
business, which covers a range of items, including electricity, pulp and
paper.

   If the stock price had remained up "I don't think I would have felt
the pressure to leave," he said.

   In January, Enron topped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. It closed Tuesday, before the announcement of Mr.
Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a share. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron
traded at $40.25, after falling below $37 during the day.

   Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the depressed
stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees,
many of whom are shareholders. "People would say `What is going on with
the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been
frustrating," said Mr. Skilling.

   The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in the interview is rather
different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious, bright and
thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal had been becoming
Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the "final straw" in his decision to
leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the
deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That trip
helped reinforce "how tenuous life is," said Mr. Skilling, who has three
children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.

   While Mr. Skilling said Enron is in "great shape," his departure
raised anxiety in the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance,
lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on "uncertainty"
created by the resignation.

   Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name
two executives to the existing "office of the chairman" within the next
few days or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom
the two would be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay
and Mr. Skilling.

Steve, is this anything Enron would be interested in doing?  I seriously doubt it, but these people are relentless in wanting to schedule a meeting with Jeff (even though the dates they wanted to do it passed two weeks ago).  I received another call today.  If it wasn't E&Y, I'd just say no, but wanted to run it by you before telling them "absolutely not and please don't call here anymore!"  Thanks, SRS

Steve/Rick,

To echo Greg, I am now here and this is one of the many items on my agenda. I have been wanting to build something like this for Enron for 2 years now. I'm a big believer that an Enron Portal will go a long way to helping Enron and its various business units consolidate its vast knowledge base to make information more readily availabe across all business units with the added benefit of reducing longer term development costs.

I've touched down in the mids't of budget season :-) , so give me a week or so and I'll come see you about this.

Now that Mark Pickering is completely transferred to Houston from London and is in his office on 27 as the CTO, we all were able to meet on the single sign on/enterprise portal project with Tony Mends.  Tony has been scoping the project and determining the IT needs for the last few weeks.  As you know, Tony now works for Mark.

Mark has some very good ideas for this project and will be following up with you soon on the plans and the progress to date.

Thanks.

I haven't forgotten.  I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days.

Steve,

I talked with Cindy a few weeks ago about a salary adjustment for me (and Mary) following the HR re-org (actually this was probably end of June). Cindy indicated she had discussed this with you and that some recommendations had either been agreed or where being considered. I think she suggested she (or you) may prefer to agree a new/extended employment agreement, which I would be happy to discuss.

Either way, I really would like to close this out in the next few days since things are obviously moving on and I don't want this weighing in the back of my mind. 

If you would prefer I'd be happy to recommend, consider and approve it myself! I'm am incredibly fair and impartial, I assure you..........

I see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.  Alot of my people are outside of Houston.  Are they solicited anyway?  When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my Houston-based and outside Houston numbers.

We have extended the campaign for three more days!

As of this morning, we are at 91.69% of our goal and 70% participation.  The 70% participation rate includes those who have completed the on-line pledge process, but may not have contributed (427 out of 4,655 have chosen not to contribute).  The contribution rate is 64%.  We also have a total of 56 Alexis de Tocqueville members which surpasses last year's total of 49.  Out of those 56, 19 are new members!  The next three days are crucial to exceeding our $2.9M goal.  Thanks for all that you can do to help make this happen.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Kathy

fyi

I spoke to Allan Zaremberg, Pres. of the Cal. Chamber of Commerce.  He
met with the Governor's folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to
discuss undercollection strategies, the MOU, and direct access.  He is
not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the
Chamber's satisfaction.  The Gov's folks truly believe that the
successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even if
Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation,  Allan believes she doesn't
really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I told
him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen
agrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see
much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides.
Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that
nothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation with
Hertzberg's office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy
agenda at this time, although they have not given up.

Thanks for the list.  One clarification:  What do you mean by the sentence starting "How challenged are we really . . ."

Steve

Here are a few thoughts on the management committee meeting at the Woodlands:

I would stay away from a general reporting on what is happening if at all possible - and focus
on a few things we really need to work on as well as a few things we should remind ourselves
are going quite well.  If we only focus on the problems I fear the group will walk away a bit
demoralized.

Second - I think we should move to many things getting driven by subcommittees of the
Management committee.  And then the recommendations sometimes being approved
by the Management committee.

Here are a few subjects that we should touch on and initiate debate but not try and
solve - get them started and turn over to a subcommittee:
PRC process
Diversity
Giving the right signal to our business about the value and cost of capital
What new businesses do we have going?
Is now the right time for Xcelerator?
More detailed external financial reporting
How do we describe ourselves to the outside world and inside world?  What messages
  do we want to modify?
What are the characteristics where our business model works and doesn't work?
How well is our RAC process really working?
We are a business where our biggest cost is people and that cost has blown out
  during the last few years - do we need to think about our biggest cost any
  differently than we did five years ago?
How challenged are we really in getting substantial credit for Enron now that it 
our credit spreads.
Enron's normal new business mindset has been to overwhelm an opportunity - EBS, EES,
power.  When this works it really pays off but in today's financial markets is a more conservative
approach warranted?

Anyway those are just a few ideas.  One of the things we might do tomorrow is solicit 
ideas from the entire committee (in writing) and work on those items of most interest.

John

I.m travelling and just picked this messahe up.
 
I don't know if Vince called you, but from a University Affairs perspective, (and I'm pretty certain A/A would agree) , Unless you just happened to be planning to be in Philadelphia, I would NOT feel any pressure to accomodate this 'Wharton energy club' speaking engagement request.  We've got a lot of exposure at Wharton already and I'd just assume save a request for your time for a more strategic opportunity.
 
In either case, let me know if you want me to respond for you.
 
Thanks!

Many quotes from KP -- the Eastern Power Markets Oracle.  On balance a good article.  Thanks for helping out.
Traders, Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires 
By Dan Morgan
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, August 23, 2001; Page A01 
Last of three articles
ATLANTA
Ever since steamboat captain W.P. Lay founded Alabama Power Co. in 1906 to develop electricity along the Coosa River, utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose: so southerners could have power and light.
Now a bunch of outsiders, who buy and sell electricity but don't have a single retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line, have their sights set on those wires, and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration.
Aided by supercomputers, and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks, the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nation's power grid, then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder. But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand, they want to remove what they contend is a "wire curtain" around the South. That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new, federally supervised regional authority.
"The monopoly is the wires, and that's where the battles occur," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was chief executive of Houston's Enron Corp., the largest of the power merchants, until he resigned last week.
The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation.
In 1992, with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid, Congress opted for a competitive market. The plan was to dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand.
Now these new merchants of power, along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world, have become strong advocates for a free-flowing, national electricity market. But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation, they are running into resistance from traditional utilities, exemplified by Atlanta's Southern Co., now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities.
At issue is how fast the federal government, in the wake of the California electricity crisis, should push for yet more changes.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recently stocked with President Bush's pro-market appointees, ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities. Those authorities, in turn, will build new transmission lines, do away with bottlenecks, set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all. Next month, the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry.
But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South, according to executives at Southern Co., whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north Florida. Southern Co., Chairman H. Allen Franklin said in a recent interview, "will not go blindly" into the system proposed by FERC.
Although unfettered access to Southern's 26,650 miles of lines might help long-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron, company officials say it could mean congestion, power outages and higher prices for their 3.9 million retail customers.
"When California was restructured, it was thought there would be massive savings," Franklin said. "Well, there haven't been."
Building the Power Trade
If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity, a visit to Houston dispels them.
In the city's energy alley, Enron Corp. -- with annual sales of more than $100 billion last year, double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor office building adjacent to its 50-story tower. Enron's competitors, Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy, are a few blocks away. Duke Energy North American, merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power, has settled in as well. And Calpine Corp. plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story building near Enron.
These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market, which now handles about a quarter of U.S. electricity output. But it is still a work in progress, fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South.
In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market, the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas. Many did. Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast, which had long endured high power costs. To spur competition, California and some northeastern states went further, requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers.
Many states went further still, ending their utilities' long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider.
The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling, in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity.
Enron, formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies, was quick to seize the opportunities. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a former official at the Federal Power Commission, FERC's precursor, during the Nixon administration, had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the 1980s.
As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s, Lay and Skilling, a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School, began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets.
Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989, Skilling recalls. Independent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract -- then sell the electricity back to Enron.
"We started creating forward and futures markets" using "a lot more financial engineering" than was required in other commodity businesses, Skilling said. By the late 1990s, Enron was buying the output of generating plants days, weeks, months and even years before it was produced, using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold.
During the past five years, Enron has been one of the nation's fastest-growing companies. Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this year, although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 high of $90, mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity. Investors pushed the price still lower after Skilling's departure last week.
Southern Inhospitality
Like other merchants, Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition. But the Southeast remained less-friendly territory.
Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation. Florida goes so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market.
The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas. The web of power lines, tied to the utilities' coal-, nuclear- and gas-fired generating plants, reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles.
For Southern Co., its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride. In 1997, it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report.
Clustered around its borders are Entergy, another huge holding company that serves Louisiana, Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas; Florida Power & Light; Carolina Power & Light; Duke Power; and the federal government's centralized power giant, the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices. Prices run 15 percent or more below the national average, thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels.
FERC, in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000, required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time. The message, a former official said, was "they couldn't use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market."
But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed, plant-to-customer systems.
A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region's utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region.
FERC investigators cited Southern Co.'s refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc. connect to its transmission lines in Alabama. Southern said the added load "would cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply."
In that case, FERC denied SkyGen's request for relief.
Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southern's territory have become possible. But he said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly. Also, he said, Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid. "If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co. to Jacksonville Electric, there'd be zero available," Presto said.
Of the overall situation in the Southeast, he said that the utilities "give you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load [retail customers]. So you have a huge highway that's supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn't available to the wholesalers."
Southern Co. Chairman Franklin dismissed as "unfounded" the complaints of the merchants, and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Co.'s lines say they generally have been treated well.
Robert Johnston, president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), which supplies power to 48 towns, took issue with the notion of a wire curtain.
"The market is growing in Georgia," he said. MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers. It also has its own generators producing power at four sites, though Southern Co. has an interest in all of them.
"There's not a grass-roots interest" driving the reforms, Franklin said. "It's the wholesale players."
While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast, though, Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market. Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year, Mirant Corp., Southern Co.'s marketing subsidiary, competed in California, the Midwest and the North, supplementing leaner profits from Southern Co.'s regulated units.
"Southern's strategy has been clear: Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home," said Allen Mosher, director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association.
Well Connected for Battle
The next move is up to the federal government.
Next month, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission, so that "vested interests" will not be able to "manipulate the use of the transmission system" to benefit their own plants, Bingaman's office said.
In the House, key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), whose state is home to Southern Co.'s western neighbor, Entergy, and Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee, who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility TXU.
Last week, Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., a Mississippi prot?g? of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), to handle regulatory and government affairs.
Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign, Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie & Associates.
Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), the hometown Houston congressman, though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay, an enthusiast for electricity deregulation, can bring to bear.
Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meetings that DeLay sponsored, but did not attend, could not reach consensus on electricity. As a result, the energy bill passed by the House on Aug. 2 skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability.
Bush's election, and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market, clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants. Bush's first two appointees to FERC, Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell, moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck.
Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas, where Wood headed the state's public utility commission. Brownell, a former Pennsylvania utility regulator, won praise from Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market.
On July 11, with a majority in tow, Wood, Brownell and William L. Massey, a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition, tossed out proposals by Southern Co. and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs.
"It was about time [a bomb] was dropped," Wood said.
But FERC's action may only have been what power association's Mosher calls the "beginning of a long movie."
Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage power lines; western property-rights advocates; and state utility regulators. Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the TVA, rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of new federal powers.
"There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability," said Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that her state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines "without our approval."
Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. "That's public property," she said.
In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co.'s affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding.
"I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us," he said.
In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an "open question" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires.
Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to "put the genie back in the bottle," according to a former FERC official.
The power merchants readily concur.
"Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities," Enron's Presto said.

I think we should find a spot on enron.com to describe management changes.
Steve,
Find attached information on management changes from the conference call script.  If you need additional information please advise.

Management Changes

Let me also update you on some recent management changes that reflect the broad, deep team that we have at Enron.  

Lou Pai, former Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, is no longer with Enron, and we thank him for his years of service.  Tom White, who had served as Vice Chairman with Lou, accepted the position of Secretary of the Army. 

Dave Delainey has taken over as Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave is extremely well prepared for this new role, and we look forward to investors getting to know him.  Seven years ago, Dave joined Enron Canada, where he led the growth of our Canadian business, then led all our North American origination activity and most recently ran our entire North America wholesale business.

Many of you know Kevin Hannon, who had been president and COO of our broadband business.  Kevin is now CEO of our global asset operations, which includes all our assets and activities outside of North America and Europe. 

Jim Fallon was recently named President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron Broadband Services.  Jim was instrumental in developing Enron's power marketing business.  For the last year, Jim has been responsible for all of EBS' domestic and international bandwidth intermediation activities.

Look at the topic below.  Should we send somebody?
Steve,

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

Vince

Vince:

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Michael

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

We are responding.  I'm tempted to compare their decrease in ad revenue with our increase in revenue and EPS -- who's burning out?

Steve,

I work in ENA producer finance (Thompson and Josey's group). Glad to see you are keeping the world at bay.

I quickly picked up my copy of Red Herring yesterday to read the Enron article. Their insight into Enron or lack thereof aside, I assume you will respond to the price gouging assertions which they prominently feature on page 21 (LEADER). Perhaps this has occurred already, if so, thanks.

Interesting that we had Tony Perkins speak to us last November in San Antonio. 

Thanks

Some further questions:
 

Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

Document attached 

I talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.  I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.  He said he would be interested.  If you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number.

I look forward to our meeting.

I was sorry to learn about your father.

Please coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I'd like her to be at meeting.
I spoke with Glenn English of the NRECA after our conversation this morning.
Of the dates you are available for a meeting in DC, September 20th works
best for him. Either Mike Steffes, ACES VP Trading & Marketing, or I will
also attend. 

Please confirm and let me know what time and place is best for you. 

Thanks again for taking the time to visit with me this morning.

I know Bob from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.  I told Bob that we probably didn't have anything for him in government affairs at this time, but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the Hill, FERC and perhaps in the Western States legislative and executive branches (if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues).  I am not asking anyone to make extra efforts ... but if you hear of someone looking, please pass Bob's resume along.

Steve, 

Attached is a cleaner version of the resume I sent you
earlier in the week.  There was a typo in the first
one I sent you.  Thank you.

Jeff's number is 713.621.8620.

He has left for a whitewater rafting trip and won't be back for a couple of weeks I think.

Steve, your thoughts on this one.

In an FT article today it says that:

?	The quality of earnings at Enron has deteriorated
?	behind the scenes financial engineering has increased
Therefore the overall standing of Enron in Wall Street has plummeted.

How do you envisage changing this perception of Enron and change investor sentiment towards the Enron stock.

Regards,

Raj Patel

I think we are out of the stock price prediction business for now.  But, as Ken made clear we are performing better than ever in our core businesses, our growth prospects are superb, and the issues we face are well managed.  We should be positioned for a great period of growth.

Steve, I don't think we want project our stock price at this point, right?  Jeff used to do this.  Your thoughts.

Ken,

Where do you think the stock price will be at the end of the year?

Somebody PLEASE help me.  How can Red Herring POSSIBLY give advice to Enron?!!!!

Red Herring's advertisement revenues in July were down 70% from 2K.  The pages that it runs ads on are down 77%. The circulation of 316,000 is lower than National Parks magazine, Muscle and Fitness, and 4-Wheel and Off-Road.

Enron lived up to its financial promises for almost 6 years straight -- EVERY QUARTER. Their revenues DOUBLED in 2K. They are # 7 on the Fortune 500.  They are moving 58% more product than 2K.  Their new weather, metals, lumber and steel divisions DOUBLED volumes in the second quarter from 2K.  Net income in the second quarter was up 40% from 2K.

Who's the "BURNOUT" here?

I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.  A couple of requests:

Could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting?
We are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.  Call when you get a chance. 713.853.1586.

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our "Negative CTC Credits" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Thanks.

Hold on.  Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it's worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make.
Rick/Bob,

Dan had a discussion with Steve Kean regarding expense attributable to Tom White during 2001.  It is my understanding from their discussion that they agreed that EES should not have to bear these costs and that I should get with you to get the appropriate place to charge them.

Bob, can you please provide me with the right home.

Please call if you have any questions.

 << File: Tom White summary2.xls >>

As you review who participates in these meetings in the future, please keep me in mind - many of the members express views and opinions along the same lines as many of our portfolio managers.  Thanks. MEK

Do we have an agenda and/or presentation for the meeting with Gov. Geringer.  Also, I would like to see his speeches/presentations and an overview of the business we have pending in Wyoming.

Steve and Ken - Curt Launer has convinced Pat Wood to meet with the natural gas industry sell-side analysts at a breakfast on Sept. 13 in NYC.  Steve - I will try to arrange a call with you and Curt before this meeting to bring him up to speed. Thanks. MEK

Bill -- fyi.  I don't want you to take any action on this until we have talked (i.e. please don't forward this or talk to the people involved yet).  Let's talk when you have a minute.
Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I submitted my resignation Wednesday, the fifthteenth of this month. My resignation is somewhat reluctant, as I've always received excellent reviews and even won an EES Power Player award. My experiences at Enron prior to the last few months has been very positive. I've learned a lot and have made many friends.
 
Your presentation at the all-employee meeting inspired me to share some important thoughts with you. I hope that my input will ultimately make Enron a better place. My employment began with EES, where I worked with the Facilities team. I enjoyed the fast pace and high profile nature of the job. I felt very successful and satisfied. After working with EES for a little over a year, I transfered to EBS to work with their facilities team. Again, I experienced a great deal of success and received frequent positive feedback.
 
With the EBS reorganization, all facilities activities and personnel were absorbed into EPSC led by Bill Donovan. I never had the opportunity to meet him. However, my direct supervisor was Janelle Duree. I was initially very excited about the move to Corp; I knew that Enron was very supportive of employee education, training and growth opportunities. I was convinced that I would be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that the company offered me, such as partial reimbursement for my Masters Degree (I currently hold a BBA in Accounting and Computer Information Systems). I was also very excited to take courses such as AutoCad, that would make me more valuable to the facilities team and allow my career to advance. Both of these opportunities were made clear to me under my previous supervisors. In fact I had already enrolled in an AutoCad course when I transferred to Corp.
 
What happened next, and continued over the next couple of months is simply unbelievable considering Enron's stated Values and Vision, not to mention the corporate culture we're all so proud of.
 
I was informed by my new supervisor that a Masters Degree was in no way necessary to perform the duties assigned to me. When I asked about setting my goals and discussing career paths, I was told that that wouldn't be necessary; I had reached the top... there was no place for me to go from here. When I asked how PRC was handled, my supervisor told me that I would be evaluated according to my communication and organizational skills---that would be all that I'd need to succeed in the environment. I was also told to cancel the AutoCad course; it was also unnecessary. In effect, I was told to lower my expectations. I still find this attitude completely unacceptable!
 
If this wasn't bad enough, a month later, I was told that I was no longer a Specialist--- I was now a Customer Service Rerpresentative and as such would be paid by the hour. It is clear that in an environment like Enron, this signaled a tremendous setback for my career. I was demoted although by all accounts I've been an invaluable asset to each group that I've worked with. In fact, all the managers that had been brought to Corp from other groups were also demoted--- their peer groups were changed to reflect Senior Specialist levels. When we complained to HR, we were told that they were completely within their rights, and that the decision was final.  Unfortunately, it was clear that the only means by which I could give my career a fighting chance was to look outside of Enron.
 
The good news is that I did find an opportunity. I have been promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Specialist. The bad news is that the company is not Enron. I really don't like the idea of leaving Enron, but I feel like I was left without a choice. What concerns me the most is that Enron's greatest asset has always been its people. If this is really true, then it's a huge shame your are rapidly losing the most important resource you have.
 
As I mentioned earlier, I am writing you because I truly feel you care about Enron's continued growth and success. I think you need to know what is happening in the organization, and the sort of impact it has on your personnel.
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
 
Respectfully submitted,
 
Debbie Suchoff

Just an observation and suggestion regarding the recent media blitz --- Make sure employees have access to Enron's side of the story via (additional) eBiz features or an e-speak feature with the Office of the Chairman when the 3rd quarter earnings are released.

I hear people talking about some of these articles (like the NY Times article this weekend and the Off Wall Street article a few weeks ago) and they don't know what to think.  The general employee population does not understand our financials and how Enron "makes markets". - At least this is my perception based on conversations that I hear in the elevators and on the bus on my to/from work.  

Anyway, my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside.

Steve, Peggy, and Doug: FYI re Region 10/EPA administrator candidate.  Please let me know how you wish me to respond.  Thank you. Jim
JVD, this came in on my e-mail while I was gone and I didn't know if Bill had forwarded it to you.  Thanks, S

Dear Jim:

I have a good friend here in Seattle named Ralph Palumbo, who is one of the
attorneys with whom we prosecuted the antitrust case against Microsoft that
we settled last year.  His wife Marlys, whom I also know well, is a
candidate for appointment as the administrator of Region 10 of the
Environmental Protection Agency, which encompasses Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and Alaska.  I know that you are busy as hell, but I wanted to set
out below some information about Marlys and about the status of her efforts
to win this appointment, and then ask whether Enron might be interested in
supporting her candidacy by putting in a good word at the White House.

Marlys received her law degree from Seattle University in 1982.  She then
spent four years as a commercial litigation associate at Bogle & Gates in
Seattle.  From 1986-89 she was general counsel of Sabey Corporation (a
diversified real estate development holding company).  From 1989-1997 she
was vice president and general counsel of Philip Environmental Inc.
(formerly Burlington Environmental), which was a publicly traded $500
million waste management and environmental engineering and remediation
company with operations in the U.S. and Canada.  In 1997 that company merged
with two other public companies to form Philip Services Corporation.  From
the date of the merger through the present, Marlys has been Senior VP, Law,
of Philip Services Corp., which is a $2 billion company that provides
integrated industrial and metals recovery services to commercial and
industrial customers in North America and Europe.  For the last several
years, Marlys has worked out of the Philip Services corporate offices in
Houston.

Marlys has in-depth expertise on environmental legal and scientific issues,
coupled with senior management experience in the business world.  She would
bring to the table a unique ability to effect a change of direction in EPA
Region 10 because she has worked effectively with this Region and other
Regions for two decades.  Implementing White House policies in Region 10
will require the Administrator to work with a staff of long-term
professional civil servants who themselves have extensive legal and
scientific expertise.  The Administrator must win their respect and must
have the personal skills to manage a large organization and lead it in new
directions.  Marlys has the experience, the skills, and the personal
qualities that would well-suit her to doing all of those things.

Her candidacy is being supported by former EPA Administrator Bill
Ruckelshaus, by other former senior EPA and Justice Department officials,
and by business and industry leaders in the Northwest, including CEOs or
other senior executives of Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, PACCAR, Puget Sound Energy,
Simpson Investments/Simpson Timber Co., Plum Creek Timber Group, Delta
Airlines, Burlington Northern, Air Cargo Management Group; FMC Corp., Fluke
Capital Management, and Sabey Corp.

My understanding is that the appointment will be made based on
recommendations from Republican Representatives and Senators from the four
states encompassed by Region 10, and key people in both the EPA and the
White House.  Washington has no Republican Senators, but Republican
Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn has recommended Marlys to the White House.

I have known Marlys since shortly after moving to Seattle in 1995.  She is
an extremely bright, charming, and capable person, and I have a lot of
respect for her.  If you think Enron would be willing to consider helping
her candidacy, I know that she would be eager to meet or talk with you or
others at Enron, and I can provide the names of the relevant contact people
at EPA and the White House.

I am not asking that you do anything as a favor to me, but only if it would
serve Enron's interests to do so.  Of course, this issue may be completely
outside the realm of those interests, and if so, I apologize for taking up
your time.  I hope all is well with you and Carrin, and look forward to
seeing both of you again soon.

I've been thinking about this.  Due to limited battery life, calling areas etc, I'm not sure that a combination cell/pager is the way to go.  I'm thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into.
Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, in collaboration with Enron Net Works, recently executed a two-year agreement with SkyTel Communications, Inc. to provide users with one- and two-way local and nationwide numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.

Under this agreement, Enron will also receive special discount incentives including, 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases through year-end 2001, trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units through year-end 2001, upload and download of contact lists from select pc-compatible hardware to new RIM devices, customized training for hardware and services featured quarterly, and monthly service costs that will be billed at 50% of normal rates for a limited time.

Personal toll free numbers, personal voice mail, operator dispatched text messages, pin-to-pin messaging and text-to-voice and text-to-fax service options will be available on select devices, including Motorola T900 and  P935.

Effective August 1, please visit ibuyit.enron.com to order hardware or request activation.

Please send me the latest version of our multi-pollutant and cap and trade proposals

Before leaving for the August congressional recess, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) made a joint statement on the Senate floor calling for an economy-wide cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Please see the attached copy of their floor statements.
They laid out a timeframe for consultation with stakeholders, including U.S. industry, and development of legislation this fall.
This follows a series of legislative activity in the Senate since the conclusion of the international climate change negotiations in Bonn, Germany in July.  At the talks, without the support and direct participation of the U.S., nations agreed to continue to develop the rules for the Kyoto Protocol with a target date for ratification by 2002.
Other Senate activity includes:
Committee approval of climate change legislation sponsored by Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Virginia) and Senator Ted Stevens (R-AL).  The bill would require development of a U.S. climate change response strategy with a long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  The strategy would seek ways to mitigate emissions and promote technology innovation, climate adaptation research and efforts to resolve scientific and economic uncertainties.  It would authorize spending of $4.9 billion over 10 years.
Passage of a non-binding resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations committee calling for the U.S. to engage in the climate change negotiations.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AL), Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) and others that provide for tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy technologies, increased research on climate science and government coordination on climate change.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to enable reporting and provide credit for land management and sequestration under a national climate change program. 
Upcoming Administration and Congressional Activity
Despite statements made last week by EPA Administrator Christine Whitman and National Security Advisory Condolezza Rice, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said yesterday that the Bush Administration would likely have an alternative climate change proposal for consideration at the next negotiations in Morocco in late-October.  
A key issue remains whether the Bush Administration will support mandatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, like a domestic cap and trade system.  In March, President Bush said he would not support mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions at power plants.  As recent events suggest, consideration of mandatory programs and emissions trading, including regulation of carbon, will be on the Senate agenda this fall.   Approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be considered through hearings and committee consideration of climate change legislation, multipollutant proposals and New Source Review reform.  
Enron's Advocacy
Enron will continue to promote its multipollutant proposal as a model for a domestic cap and trade program -- that could also provide a framework to address carbon emissions.  We will also offer our expertise on emissions trading and risk management to the Administration and Congress as they consider options to address climate change.
I will keep you posted on the status and movement on these legislative proposals.  Please feel free to contact me with questions about any of these proposals.

Hi Steve -- Following is a request to reinstate "View" access to one member of the OLER group.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need to discuss.  Otherwise, please approve and return to me for implementation.
 
Thanks.
Jo Ann
Approved.
 
Thanks!
Mary -- I met with Michelle today to review the needs of her group's access.  As the appropriate way to address this, Michelle is requesting the HR_VIEW_BASIC_DATA_ORG-ENTERPRISE role, which includes salary, for only one person in her group.  The HR Risk Management Group does require this access in their roles.  However, Michelle is limiting the access to only one person in her group who will then provide the data to the requestor as needed.  
 
This is the first request that I would say that should be approved.  LaQuitta Washington, for whom the request is being made, had the access before and it was removed during the audit.
 
If you approve, please return to me and I'll send to Steve and David Oxley.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

For your review.
 
Thanks!
Mary,
 
I think that LaQuitta should have enterprise-wide access.  What do I do to get approvals for that?
 
Thanks.
 
Michelle
Hi Michelle, 
 
As we discussed in our meeting this morning I need to have enterprise-wide access in order to run my reports.  I run the Quarterly Utilization, EEO-1 and VETS100 reports for all business units.  I also need this access to run the reports for the Affirmative Action Plans and to be able to provide Personnel History reports for Valeria Hope when she needs them for terminated employees that have filed complaints.  90% of the reports I run are companywide.  We also get various requests from different business units to provide ad hoc reports.  I filled out and submitted a SAP Security Request Form on 7/12.  It was assigned ticket #513575 but I'm not sure when they will get around to it.  If you need any more information, please give me a call.

Steve -- For your approval.
Thanks.

Approved.

Thanks!

Mary -- After discussions with Meg, I am requesting approval for the following access that we are modifying from the original request.

JAMES COLLINS - No action necessary.  Currently has HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP.
KATHY ABSHIRE - Requesting approval for original request of HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP.  Needed to perform audits of Personic Users access to keep in sync with SAP active users and serves as backup to James Collins in administering the enterprise-wide employee referral program.
THERESIA JAMES - Requesting approval for original request of HR_Non-Confidential_View_ENTP with an expiration date of  9/15/01.  The tasks she performs will be transitioned to the OLER group at which time her access will be removed.

If you agree, please note your approval and return to me.  I'll consolidate both outstanding requests and forward to Steve.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Thanks Jo Ann.

I need the following changes to Outlook:

 I need my file folders to be "active" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline.
I need my "inbox" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don't want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.  I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline.

Let's discuss.  I think we should emphasize, at the outset, our proposed solution.

 

Attached is the Dunn letter with minor edits, including suggestions sent by Hedy.  Also attached is a one-page summary of the key points.  Let's plan on discussing on the 10:30 a.m. CST call.

Thanks.

Amy Kim is still an open question.
I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?
I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.
I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past).

Steve - I hope your vacation was terrific!

Now that you're back, I'll start bombarding you with budget questions:

- Rick mentioned on Friday that Amy Kim was moving into your budget.  When does that start, and should I include her for next year?  Aside from budget issues - what will be her function or group?

- Rick has asked that all charitable contributions budgeted in his group be run through Community Relations.  I'll forward the numbers to Elyse and Misha.  Are there any other groups within Public Affairs that you want to do this as well?  For example, Palmer has made some this year, as have you.  

I'm guessing the Terraso and Kimberly should continue to budget this in their cost centers.

- What sorts of metrics do you want to show in our Skilling meeting?  (I'm assuming for Public Affairs.)
	- Do you want to illustrate value added (origination/risk mitigation/market opening/earned media)?
	- I'll do a chart showing difference year to year, and the composition of such difference.  Do you want to break this down 	by group?  Do you also want to illustrate headcount differences?
	- In the past we've illustrated fixed (empl and empl expenses) vs. variable (everything else) costs.  Do you want a chart to 	illustrate this?
	- What else would you like to show for PA?

- What sorts of metrics do you want to show for your other groups?
	- EPSC and Aviation
	- HR/Benefits and Exec Compensation

I've been thinking about the need to recast the "e-commerce" position as well.  I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks.

Steve -

We are beginning our planning for faculty recruiting for the fall of 
2002.  We tried hard this year to recruit a person for the finance (risk 
management) position and made an offer but he eventually chose to stay 
where he was for family reasons.  We will try again with him but will also 
widen the search again.

We will begin the search for the second Enron Professorship which was 
described as E-commerce.  Since we initially discussed this a lot has 
happened in the E-commerce world and we think it might be useful to 
re-designate the field a bit.  The use of the web and technology in 
business has become a critical part of the fundamental operations of the 
business and as we think that a professorship in operations management with 
a bent toward the use of the web and other related technologies might the 
educational needs of the students better and with better long term 
results.  Is this too far afield from the grant or do you think we would be 
in the general parameters?

Thanks.

P.S.  I have not yet seen your picture with a pie!!!

This is to confirm my earlier phone conversation with the security desk:

effective immediately, terminate access to the Enron Building for Asem Atta.  If Mr. Atta attempts to enter the facility please call any one of the following individuals:

Steve Kean
Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff (3-1586); home (713.621.6550)

John Brindle
Senior Director, Business Controls (3-3843)

John Presley
Business Controls

Please deal with Mr. Atta firmly but with courtesy and respect.

What do we think it means for the pace of reform?  Is it a mandate?

Dear Steve,

Please find enclosed a note on the results of the Upper House election held here in Japan on July 29. 

In a nutshell, there were no real surprises. The ruling coalition achieved a comfortable majority of 12 seats, for a total of 136 seats, in the 247 seat chamber. 

I'd be happy to put together a more detailed analysis if needed.

This is still confusing to me.  I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached).

 

Steve and Kevin, 

the following is a draft of an announcement communicating the transfer of responsibility for the corporate facility operations audit program to me.  Previously the program, although corporate in scope was administered in the ETS group.  Please review  draft and provide comments.  Thanks Mike Terraso

DRAFT

Responsibility for the corporate operational, environmental, safety and social audits of facility assets has been transferred from Enron Transportation Services to Corporate Public Affairs under Mike Terraso, Enron's Vice President of Environmental, Health and Safety and Chief Environmental Officer.  Directors of Facility Audits, Chuck Goode and Steve Allen will report to Mike and be responsible for leading the corporate operations management system audits of assets.  Technical experts from business unit operations and engineering will continue to serve on the multidisciplinary audit teams.   

fyi

Steve, unfortunately I am attending a Fortune Magazine conference in California Oct. 3-5. I'm quite disappointed I won't be able to attend. Thank you for the invitation though!

See attached

 

Hi -- here's another draft of the article that reflects all of your comments, including yesterday's suggestions from Sarah and Mary.

The EB team would appreciate a quick reaction from you, particularly as to whether the article runs or not.

I welcome your feedback,

Mike -- how about Lisa Jacobson?

Mike,

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation,
given our relationship with the Wharton School. I  think it can be somebody
below Steve's level - the occasion does not justify allocating
time of a senior executive.

Vince

Vince, What is your opinion regarding the value of making a presentation?  Mike

Please discuss with Vince.  I don't know how to engage relative importance

Steve, if you think it would be of value to have someone speak  on at the Wharton School Energy Club, I can develop a presentation addressing the topic Global Warming and the Energy Industry.  Mike

Look at the topic below.  Should we send somebody?
Steve,

I have received an inquiry from a professor at the Wharton School who
would like to invite a senior executive from Enron to speak at their
Energy Club. I gave him your name, so you can expect a call from him or one
of his associates.

Sorry if I put another burden on your shoulders.

Vince

Vince:

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Amy,
Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
the March 1997 meeting as well.

Michael

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

I think you are right:  most people will elect to travel by car, alone or in groups.  I doubt that a bus will make sense.

Just wanted to pass this along.  It's good to know he is alright.

With someone like Mr. Foster so nervous about air travel, do we need to consider alternative travel options for our VPs?  I'm assuming a lot more will chose to drive from Houston to San Antonio -- I know I will this year.  The idea of chartered buses from Houston to San Antonio surfaced, but I expect most who opt to drive will want control of the time they leave and return to Houston and arrange a small carpool.  What are your thoughts?

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Terrie, a warm thx to you.  We are, thank God, all OK here, both family and
friends.  Friends of friends were badly hit however, and that hurts all of
us.  NYC is a different place today than a little more than a week ago.

As long as you are sending the plane I am coming.  Frankly, without the
plane it would be a tough decision to make.  I find that most meetings
requiring travel these days are getting canceled.  It is one thing for an
individual to fly, it is another thing for an a father or mother to leave
spouse and children at home.   That is very hard to justify at this point.

Thanks for your concern and kindness.

Dick (and Heidi),

I wanted to check in and make sure you were okay after last week's

I think we will get alot of "don't knows" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for. 

 I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.

Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.

Steve, Mike and Mark,

As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).

The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.

Thank you,

I want to personally thank each of you for your work following last weeks tragic events.  It was deeply gratifying to see so many motivated, calm, and competent people assemble, organize and get the job done.  As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep competitive intelligence flowing to our business units and management, and make good and timely judgements on issues as they arose.

 I hope your friends and family are well.  If any of you have former colleagues, friends or family who were affected by the tragedies you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks.

Let's just circulate the presentation and ask people if they have any comments.  Thanks

Steve:

You had requested that we get the Rice MBA team together to review and discuss the presentation prior to the Partio tomorrow.  Would you still like to conduct this brief meeting or should we try to reschedule for next week?

Thanks!

I think that since we are targeting some commercial support groups (legal and accounting), we should broaden the term "business unit" to include business unit or functional group.

I'm OK with sending this out, but understand that people are up to their necks right now.  we may not get much response now.  We might get more if we waited beyond the management conference.

Steve, Mary and I are ready to send out an email to the potential executive sponsors of the ThinkOut.  Please review the memo as soon as possible, and let me know if you have any changes.  Thanks so much.

Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing

Steve,

I'm looking into Siegel's availability now.  Do you consider Mr. Stelzer a strong alternative to Freund or Siegel?

Freund is very good, but Siegel is more on top of things; his book is very 
good. I am better than both and wouldn't have the nerve to charge you.    
Irwin

fyi
In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.

Best,
Jeff

	Our best information is that the CPUC will NOT VOTE on direct access tomorrow, but will continue the meeting to another date and time.  Will let you know when we know the new date for the meeting.

I have forwarded this to Fitch.  You should compare with your list and consolidate (or have Gary consolidate) onto one.

I talked to Ken yesterday and he is fine with this.

Steve,

Fyi!  I left Ken a message on the e-mail below and he said he wanted to get with you.  If you can reply by email to the people below, we will handle from there.

I will be out of the office on 9/17, 9/18 and 9/19.

Thanks!!

Mary

Jenny, I'm not sure you're the appropriate person with whom to address this; please let me know...

Jeff Skilling and I will no longer be Enron employees effective 9/15/01.  We have sent out letter to several hundred business associates and friends of Jeff's letting them know how to reach him; however, I suspect we missed more than a few.  I'd like to keep our phone numbers (JKS x36894 and me X35984) through the end of the year for voicemail purposes only.  I will put a greeting on which give new contact information.  In addition, I'd like to have a "bounce back" message on e-mail for both of us giving our new e-mail addresses; we would not necessarily need access to Enron's e-mail.  I have already activited the "out of office assistant" on my e-mail giving a forwarding e-mail address and instructing those with Enron business to contact Liz Taylor in Greg Whalley's office; I'll do the same for Jeff.  We'd like to have that activated through 10/31/01.

Thanks for your assistance, Jenny.  Please let me know if there is anything further I need to do to make this happen.  SRS

All:

I read about this in the WSJ.  A must read.

Some of my brother's salespeople had a very bad night
in a Houston hotel.

This is one of the greatest complaints that I've ever seen.

What does "held" mean?  Do they start over or do they pick up where they left off?

Thanks

Thanks for all you are doing

This is fully consistent with what we are communicating throughout the organization

Billy - I concour and agree with John's comments.  Ted

Please give me your thoughts on this.  I've had a few questions so far, and I think alot of people are wondering about this.  I would send it to the Executive Leads for each school, the Program Department in Houston and the HR Leads.  Steve - I'd like your opinion to be sure that I'm consistent with our corporate position. 
 
Thanks,
Billy

The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program.
 
Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities.  Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel.  With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities.  
 
Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus.  I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications.  Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books.  The focusing benefits of these tools can signficantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities.  In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations.
 
Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me at extension 36671.
 
Best regards,
Billy Lemmons  

We are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc.  Terrie James is working with Ken on speakers.  It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today.

Any more progress on the Management Conference?  Are you running with it?  I really think we need a more conservative
challenge than "Becoming or renewing our pledge to be the World's Leading Company".  It just doesn't ring true
with our employees until we get the share price moving back up.

John

Thanks for the inquiry.  We do not have an interest in sponsorship.

Dear Mr Kean,

In follow up to the recent email sent to Enron seeking the company's
interest to participate as a sponsor in the WTO Forum next March, I haven't
heard back from you and as events in the US have overshadowed any business
decisions last week, I thought it prudent to wait until now to pick up my
correspondence.

With WTO now certain for the PRC, I am hoping that you may have reviewed the
proposal sent and discussed it amongst the appropriate people within Enron
and at least have a preliminary view on interest at this point.  I would
certainly be happy to follow up on any further questions or information that
you require.

Kindly advise at your earliest convenience as to the next step in the
process of consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).
 
In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today."

Steve,
 
What is the big obstacle to large-scale ethanol production?  The cost of the refineries?  It seems that it would be a natural to make us less dependent on foreign oil.

In preparation for the Commissioner meetings later this week,  attached is a copy of the most recent version of the Show Cause Motion.  I am still working on it -- I want to beef up the section on entities already in an ISO/RTO, but you'll have an idea of the concepts we're developing.

Although we do not want to share a copy of the pleading with the Commissioners yet, we thought you should see where we're going on the Motion.  Please call me with questions.

Sarah

 

I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion.  While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment.

In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO.  PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA.  FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable.

While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that.  We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO.  It does not provide for exceptions.  

A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug.  First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE.  Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement.  

Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment.  It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA.  Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment - perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly, although this looks a little transparent.  The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO.

Also, Paul and I discussed the "One Western RTO" issue and how Enron responds to that.  We talked about three possibilities: 1) try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue -- push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the one-versus-two-versus-three RTOs in the West; 2) take a position saying that the west is different, the California mess continues, people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west, so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC; 3) support FERC's statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this (although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development); or 4)  focus on the east and forget about the west.

The second option causes me concern because I think that, if we take this position in the West, even though the West is different, our position will be used against us in the East.  For example, some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York (a disfunctional market) will contaminate PJM (a working market).  It's a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east.  If we make contrary arguments in the west, they will be used against us in the east.

Your thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks

Sarah

Steve,

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 

I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.

Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."
He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

I know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.  I agree with John.  There is little point showing this to Ken ... but you personally know him better, so I leave it to you.
Rosie - I leave it to you and Steve to determine whether or not to show this to Mr. Lay.  This is indeed a stinging letter which may serve no purpose being showed to Mr. Lay at this point.  We will determine where this gentleman worked, if there were any other issues involved, and will get back to you.  Please let me know if the author tries to call or sends mail/package.

							Thanks -  John

I don't want to show this one to Ken.  This guy sounds really angry, though, and wants Ken to write him back.

Rosie

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,

Scott Hendrickson

Thanks, Jeff.  We have already retained a crisis PR firm --Kekst and Co.  They have been working with us for the past few weeks.  Feel free to mention them to Chase.

Rick,
As the press seems to be turning worse, I would strongly advise Enron to call George Sard of Citigate Sard Verbinnen at (212) 687-8080.  George is probably the leading crisis communications advisor in the world and could offer them great counsel, especially in distributing and managing the current press release.  We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation.
Hope that's helpful.

Nice.

My follow up question on the pay would be: did McMahon or any members of the board receive any form of compensation in connection with these entities, even if this compensation did not come from the entities?

Answer: No

Peter, you are free to say that we did not provide responses to your other questions. Your last article acknowledges the fact that your inquiries are based on information supplied by entities suing Enron.  We do not comment on litigation.

Bridget's spreadsheet shows $3.2 million paid.  At an August "Art Committee" meeting, Lea indicated $4.4 million committed to date, i.e. may be some large invoices outstanding.

I'm working with Jeff Shankman to contain.   - Bill

Per my conversation with Bill this morning, please find attached the list of art purchases and expenses:

The following invoices are outstanding and need to be processed for payment:

Sarah Balinskas - $2,441.04 (Art)
Lea Fastow - $8.00 (Parking)
Atelier4 - $1,328.00 (Transportation of art work)

Bill, the invoice I mentioned for $72,000 had been paid.

Thursday is fine.  Please schedule.
Steve - the upper part of the document was prepared by my group.  The lower half was done by Donovan.  We were scheduled to meet with you on Monday and were going to incorporate the oil spill cleanup meeting.  With respect to that, we have the international solution ready.  We took it upon ourselves to address the same issue with the domestic pipes and Kyle found Phil Lowry to be extremely interested.

Regarding the meeting with our group - could we do it Thursday if convenient?  A couple people will be out tomorrow.  Thanks again very much Steve.

Thursday is fine.  Let's talk about the proposed expenditures.  We will need to prioritize.

Thanks so much.  As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.  I will be in touch when the time comes.

Steve, I realize that all of you are under enormous pressure and stress, coupled with a lot to do.  If I can be of assistance in any way to our department or any other, i.e. research, preparing documents, etc. please don't hesitate to let me know.  Just tell me what to do, and consider it done.

Governor Jim Geringer of Wyoming is in the process of organizing a meeting between himself, 3-4 other western governors, and FERC Commissioner Pat Wood to discuss wholesale electricity issues facing the Western Power Market.  This meeting is expected to take place in the next couple of weeks. 
 
In preparation of the meeting, Governor Geringer has requested information on the following issues which I would like each of you to provide me by next Tuesday, September 4th.
 

General Summary of the Western Power Market as it exists today - Steve Walton 
A summary of Enron's position on the FERC RTO Model and the necessary components of a well-designed RTO - Steve Walton 
A summary of FERC's Price Cap Order and the implications it has had on the West - Alan Comnes 
An update of the Refund proceedings and next steps - Bob Frank 
Summary of FERC's failure to go after California for failure to comply with FERC - Sue Mara 
Update of CALISO issues - Sue Mara  

Thank you

It's going to be postponed til Feb.  I think you should attend when we have it.
thanks
Steve:

I think I need to go to this, but you will need to approve it.

Jeff Gray, of course, would be interested in attending too, but I understand if one exception is all we can handle right now.  Jeff finishes up his rotation on Friday March 1st.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Jordan Mintz told me that the release needs to be reviewed one more time by securities lawyers.  He will take care of it.

here it is

 

David would  you please forward to the right person.

What about  Naturalized U.S. citizens?  Cannot carry an original
certificate with me, so am I correct in assuming that if  the officials key
in my Social Security #, it will reflect that I am a citizen?  Do you the
answer or could you please find this out for me?

   Enron  has  been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
   Some  of  the  changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
   personnel)  and  some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
   be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on everyday
   activities.   In  all  the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
   will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to
   increase  your  sense  of  security,  while  doing  our best to minimize
   disruption to our day-to-day business.

   Primary  responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business
   controls  organization.  You can contact this organization through their
   website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or
   by                   email                  (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
   <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   John  Brindle, Senior Director,
   Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide
   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions, or to report
   security threats.

   We  have  two  areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our travel
   advisory.

   Access to the Enron Center

   Over  the next few days, the following access control procedures will be
   instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

        ?  As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the
           Enron  Center,  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the
           bearer.

        ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a
           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center (U.S.
           driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S.
           federal, state or local identification).

        ?   Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when
           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill
           out  the  visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID
           (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form
           of  U.S.  federal,  state  or  local identification) will not be
           allowed access to the Enron Center.

        ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an Enron
           employee or badged contractor at all times.

        ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by an
           Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log
           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or  badged
           contractor,   and   escorted   to  their  appointment.   At  the
           conclusion  of  the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge
           collected,  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the plaza
           reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

        ?  Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of
           their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious
           activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors
           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open, allowing
           "tail gating" by others.

   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to be
   instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient during
   congested  times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard
   personnel  and  equipment,  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We
   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security
   of all our employees.

   Travel Advisory Update

   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we  have  two important
   recommendations:

        ?   While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.
           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during this
           time  to  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
           Sudan,  Somalia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Georgia,  and  the
           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In addition, we recommend that
           planned   travel  to  Egypt,  Israel,  Gaza/West  Bank,  Jordan,
           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very carefully
           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry his/her
           "registration"  documentation  with  them at all times. This can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment
           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary
           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been
           asking  domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current
           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your
           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Looks good.  In the memo I wouldn't have ken refer to Dean Powers as "Bill"  sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing.

Attached are the voice mail and email scripts going out to employees.  The script site is up and running.

This is the final version agreed to by Citi and Chase.

 

The attached press release is the latest draft, which has been approved by Enron and one part of Citigroup.  JPMorgan is still reviewing, as is another part of Citigroup.  The release includes several bracketed phrases and sentences that are still being discussed. 

In the first paragraph, Citigroup wants to use "including due diligence" and delete "final."

In the fifth paragraph, Citigroup wants to use the phrase "in a few days" rather than "shortly."

The quote from JPMorgan may or may not be in the final release.

Once the terms of the agreement are finalized, we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday (6 a.m.).  If you have any comments or changes, please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail.

Thank you.

I think we should shoot for Tuesday (after the written info is released Mon).  I will work on a release today that announces the Tues call and the mon written disclosure.  Here's what I think we should say in the release 1) explain the silence (complex transactions... we wanted to provide clear and full explanations; new CFO getting up to speed; and we've been busy getting liquidity and meeting with rating agencies etc. ) 2) promise the additional disclosure (monday's written info and Tues call) and 3) list the topics.  I also think it needs to be a call not a webcast.  What do you think?

Steve - any update on when we can have a call or webcast?  MEK
Mark Koenig

Would be happy to.  Just let me know where.

I just wanted to let you know that we do have a bank meeting scheduled for next Friday, November 9th beginning at 8:00 a.m. CST. I have sent a notice to all of our relationship contacts at our approximately 70 banks that this meeting is for banks only and their respective credit officers. Objective of the meeting is to provide credit-related information - it is not a syndication meeting for the new Chase/Citi $1 billion facility.  My thought is that if you can , you all would attend.

Thanks and I will  keep you all updated as this meeting moves forward,

Kelly

Ken, Greg and Mark,

I wanted to provide you a suggested agenda for the rescheduled Management Conference.  After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability, here is what we are proposing:

Location:   Westin La Cantera Resort, San Antonio (The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February.  We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation.  Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.)

Dates:   Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.  However, these are the dates that the hotel is available.  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.) 

Agenda:	

DAY 1		Friday, February 22

2pm - 5pm	Registration

6pm - 9pm	Reception and Chairman's Dinner
		Speaker:  General Norman Schwarzkopf  (The General is currently available on this date, but has not accepted the engagement.  I feel that, if we can 		reschedule him, he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities.)

DAY 2		Saturday, February 23

8am - 2pm	Business Agenda  (I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations/panel on the agenda.  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel.  Otherwise, I will		remain flexible on the agenda.)

2pm		Meeting Adjourns

		No planned activities  (The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time.)

We'd like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible.  While details on the agenda can be resolved later, please let me know if you are comfortable with the dates and location so we can include that information in the memo.

Regards,
Terrie James

The Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.  Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the plan, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios.

 

I don't think so.

Do you know if anyone other than Irwin from the Advisory Council was planning to attend the Mgmt. Conf.?  I will contact Irwin (and others, if necessary).  I will also check with Terri James.  PHR

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay 

Meredith please give Cheryl a copy of our external q&A draft.  
Cheryl -- it's a draft and the SEC lawyers have not fully vetted it.

In preparation for this Friday's Bank Meeting, we are in need of a comprehensive Question & Answer List for the Q & A session at the end of our presentation.  If you have such a list right now, could we use that as a basis for ours? Cheryl Lipshutz is spearheading our efforts.

The Bank Meeting is still scheduled for this Friday at the Hyatt, beginning at 8:00 a.m. and all of you are encouraged to attend. 

Some good news.  Your call to Gov Rowland was helpful.  We are not finished yet, but we are on our way.

Steve/Rick - It appears that Gov Rowland is going to move this ball forward as he promised to do.  I have had several meetings since the Kean/Lay call with Rowland and the message from him has been consistent.  This is further confirmation.  Please call should you wish to discuss further.  SM

 

Thanks for thinking of us.  We have retained a crisis communications firm  -- Kekst &CO. -- to assist us.  They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken.

Mary Beth - I thank you your e-mail.Although I?m part of the special
committee,everything related to the company we
defer to them.
As so, I?m including Steven Kean on this e-mail, because he is the one in
charge, among other things, of  PR.

Steve, Rob asked me to send the following suggested Q & A to you:

Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?

A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.

I trust this is what you needed.  If not just let me know.  Thanks.

FYI - I do think our IR group puts out a little better product, but thats irrelevant.  MEK

(See attached file: GIPPER CONFERENCE CALL SCRIPT.doc)

CONFIDENTIAL TO THE MEDIATION.  PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD!

Attached are Enron's comments to the GridSouth,GridFlorida/Entergy proposal and the Southern etal proposal.  I will be back at the mediation next week and the judge's report to the Commission is due the next week.

Steve:

Corporate Business Controls - Position Elimination - Portland Office 
I wanted to ensure that you were aware that John's group has one (1) employee (Chad Beers) in the Portland office who will be asked to relocate to Houston no later than 01/02/02, as the position in Portland is scheduled to be eliminated effective 01/02/02.  
Therefore, if the employee elects not to accept the position in Houston his employment would be terminated on 01/02/02 and he would be scheduled to receive the current business reorganization severance.

Based on this request, I plan to send Chad a Relocation Offer letter which also includes the information summarized above along with a severance calculation estimate.  

Could you please respond to this e-mail to indicate your concurrence.  If you do concur, I will proceed with associated paperwork.

Thank you Steve,

Board meeting running long. 

Nice work, John.  Please copy me and Ken on any recap you put together.

	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P=
ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20
=20
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo=
del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin=
g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  Ho=
wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=
termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =
platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =
There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=
ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=
he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=
C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=
).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=
odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =
a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=
rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=
mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=
tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=
 will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=
r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=
 would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=
ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=
ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=
 the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=

ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=
opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =

The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=

Her opinion is that the "Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=

 of Order No. 2000 based on a "best practices" analysis of other RTOs and C=

Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =

Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =
extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta=

Jeff - 

Here is cash flow on new building, as requested.  Some notes:  

The $218.7 mill. Base Building and Trading Floor Tenant Improvements (i.e. 2nd floor Cafeteria, Trading floors 3-6, 7th floor Executive, and Computer floors 8 and 9) is work in progress, over 80% complete and paid to date.  Not much we can do here except suffer the anger of contractor and hold retainage as long as possible ($14 mill. payment in May '02).  We are contractually obligated to make draw payments on the 5th of each month ($4.785 mill. to be paid next week).

Presently we are gearing up spend ($28 mill.) on Tower Tenant Improvements (interiors of floors 10 thru 40).  This is deferrable, either partially or in full, if we re-think our strategy on who, when, how many move to new tower.

I'll be out of office rest of week but reachable.  Thanks - Bill

I agree with Beth.  We had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage, but the Dynegy option was the best.  It's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down.
Can we take out the part about the ship going down?  Otherwise, I am fine with it. Beth

Irwin is on Enron's advisory council.  Could one of you send him a reply?

Sorry -- I was not cleaqr. I am after the company's value in the olden days 
when Ken appeared on the scene and you guys were still a small pipeline. My 
recollection is that something like $2 billion is the number, but I could be 
way off. What I am hoping to be able to say is that those investors who 
bought in at that long-ago time and stayed in have had their investment 
quintuple. Right?

Hello Steve,

I left Mike Hicks a voicemail message yesterday.  

TAP (US & Canada), Navigant (Nepco, Seattle) Vitol (Domestic), Ayscough (London), Imperial Tour (PGE, Portland) and Travel Management Consultants (EES, Chicago) confirmed that we did not have any employees booked on flight 587.  

Eight (8) employees were identified with reservations to leave New York yesterday.  They were all contacted and ultimately able to proceed with travel plans.

Please don't hesitate to phone me directly if you have any questions.

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.

Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.

I have done extensive CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) work with Jackson in connection with the passage of Financial Services Modernization.  This will be tricky.

I wasn't sure if this was in the clips.

Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy deal. 
The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houston-based energy firms. 
"Dynegy needs our participation to get approval," Jackson said Monday. 
The organization's interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and EEOC rulings. 
Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown. 
Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum. 
Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said. 
The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said. 
Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau chief here. 
The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year. 
Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level management and contracts, Jackson said. 
Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax. 
He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars. 
"It must be bottom up," Jackson said. 
One-third of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers, worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months. 
This would help employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season, he said.

A couple of clarifications:

The $800 million of proceeds from asset sales does not include Azurix NA ( that cash goes to Azuirx, not Enron).
PGE sale - not $2 billion in PS;  $200 million in PS and $50 million in common stock
The investor call was extended to 8:30 t0 10:00 am and will focus more on the current business and financial stituation at Enron rather than the 8K filed last week.

MESSAGE POINTS FROM MEETING
MONDAY, NOV. 13, 2001

Upcoming Events 

?	Tues., Nov. 13 - 8K filing re secured financing
?	Tues., Nov. 13 - Customer letters from EES - will go out possibly today
?	Tues., Nov. 13  - Baker Institute - Enron prize to Alan Greenspan - Ken to attend
?	Wed., Nov. 14 - 8K filing (Dynegy and Enron separately filing) with merger agreement (perhaps with summary) 
?	Wed., Nov. 14 (8:30 - 9:30 am (CST)) - Investor update conf call re liquidity, 8K on SEC questions, and Whitewing and Marlin
?	Mon., Nov. 19 (time t/b/a) - Bank meeting @ Hyatt in Houston 
?	Thurs., Nov. 29 - Possible All employee meeting 

Questions of the Day

?	Liquidity and counterparty activity.  Transaction count on EnronOnline (media and investors)

For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of 5,800 transactions with a notional value of $2.7 billion. 

?	Quantification of litigation (media and investors)
o	no specific comment on litigation
o	shareholder suits likely to be consolidated
o	$3.5 billion "basket" in merger agreement is designed to cover all Enron litigation (i.e. not just shareholder litigation) and the parties believe this will be sufficient

?	Ken Lay's compensation (media and employees)
o	Ken, like many CEOs, has a change in control provision in his contract (and has had one for many years)
o	Ken has elected to waive his right to payment under that provision

Messages of the Day

?	Impact of merger on asset sales transactions (e.g. Dabhol) (media) 

Enron will continue with our asset sales program as previously announced.  Those asset sales that have been announced include EcoElectrica, CEG/CEG Rio, EOGIL and Portland General Electric, as well as Azurix North America, which closed on November 7.  These transactions total $800 million plus PGE ($1.55 billion cash, $2 billion in preferred stock and $1.1 billion in debt)

?	Timing of funding from Chevron (banks and rating agencies)
o	Obligation - 3 business days after filing HSR (expected today), expect funding to occur earlier

?	Impact of transaction on specific areas (e.g. Portland, Japan, Florida and other office locations) - case by case

Attached is Jim's prepared statement filed last night for today's House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee (Chairman Barton) hearing on reliability, transmission incentives and siting issues.  You will see we use the opportunity to make a plug for large RTOs as well.  Jim will actually deliver a five minute oral summary.  He is appearing as the EPSA witness in his capacity as chairman of the EPSA Regulatory Affairs Committee.  There will be ten witnesses on the panel.  Others will represent EEI, NARUC, APPA, LPPC, NRECA, NERC (David Cook), ELCON, Consumers for Fair Competition, and GF Energy.  We will provide a report following the hearing.

 

 

Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.

Ken talked with Barton.  

Barton will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).

Thanks for the message.  I don't know of anything moving forward as yet.

Steve,

While Enron's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron.

Regards,

Allan Sommer

I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

Steve -- I'm sure there's nothing to this, but let me know how to respond. thx. kd

This deal depends on the support of your forces - I understand that folks
are upset at ENE mgt particularly Ken's sweetheart deal

What are the chances you guys try to wiggle out of this once we stabilize
you?  I've got to account for that on the Street if it's a real possiblity!

Could you take a look at this?
John Sherriff and Michael Brown would like to send out the attached letter to employees in Europe this afternoon (ie in the next 3 hours).  I would be grateful if you would review it and let us have your approval as soon as possible.

I have a couple of questions in relation to the content:

1.  Can we refer to Wessex Water on our list of non-core assets in Europe?

2.  Can we list the specific businesses under review as per the proposed draft below (which is not included in the attached draft?)

"The businesses currently under review in Europe are Global Markets (except Coal), Industrial Markets, Metals, Credit and the Wind Turbine manufacturing business.  Also under review is the E Power generation asset development business in Japan".  Given that these businesses are being identified in the media I would assume that we can although note that they don't appear in your message point summary received last night.

A prompt response would be very much appreciated.  Thanks.

in case you're wondering...
Hey gang --
 
I forgot that, after rescheduling three twice due to the events of the past month, Teresa scheduled a meeting for 9:30 this morning with our financial planner.  As a bonus, I'll bring you back his best tips for 401K manipulation in light of our present circumstances!  If I'm needed -- particularly since I sprung this one -- please feel free to call me on my vibrating cellage.  KD -- if I'm needed critically, call.  I can skip if I have to.  I'm getting ready to slam out some more A's for Mary's long list of Q's and hope to focus on that a great deal today.
 
Q: Will Enron senior management lose their bonuses, go to jail, apologize publicly, sit naked in a dunk tank at the next ECafe, donate their life savings to the United Way, and resign immediately?  Also, what happens to Starbucks?
A: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.  On the first one, our review of the situation is underway and no decisions have yet been made, but we welcome your suggestions.  On the second one, beverage service issues will be part of the transition team focus.  

Thanks for the invite.  We will probably still be on our way back from New Mexico (we're driving), so we won't be able to come.  Have a good time ... I know you will.

I hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.  I understand that Ken and Chuck have spoken and that Greg, Stan, and Dave will be coming over at 3:00 and no one is expected to be there at 1:00.  Correct?

please find Bob Lane's phone number for Rick
Phone #?

didnt keep it

Did you have Bob Long's resume?

Thanks for the inquiry; I appreciate the interest very much.  But I am not interested in participating.

As you know, we are about to reduce EMG workforce by over 45%.  I have spent the last couple of weeks spending one on one time with  many, many employees who are not dealing well with the recent events, and who are anticipating the worst for themselves and their families.  I certainly commend the company on an orderly process, but we need to make our professional counciling staff more visible, and remind employees that this important service is available.

I cannot stress enough how poor morale, etc, is over here, and anything we can do to help will be greatly appreciated by the employees.

Regards,

Jeff

Melissa's mom will be coming, so we will be sticking around Hous.

Steve,
 
Are you going to be able to make it to Dubuque for Christmas?  Diane and I will be there, arriving the 24th and leaving on the 27th.  Hope you can make it.

thank you and good luck.  Stay in touch

This week (Thursday) will be my last day at Enron after eleven plus years and I just wanted to say thank you for enriching my life while here at the company.  Good luck to all of you.

Steve,

I have been told that the severance program is "under review".

As you well know, many long term, dedicated Enron employees who have been with the company for nearly a decade have seen their entire net worth completely wiped out.  Retirement plans, college funds, etc have all evaporated.  Since the average tenure for an Enron employee is rather short, I believe that this subset is actually quite small.  This small subset of employees has been wronged.  I believe one way to cushion this blow is to alter the severance equation as follows:

4 weeks X (number of employment years)
1 week X  (each 10,000 of salary)

Example one: 2 year employee with an $80,000 salary = 2*4+80/10 = 16 weeks severance

Example two: 10 year employee with a $100,000 salary = 10*4+100/10 = 50 weeks severance

This will accomplish two tasks, one is to skew the severance towards the longer term employees, the other is to reduce the total outlay so as not to overburden the company (since the group receiving the higher severance is small). I believe this is fair to both the employees and to our soon-to-be new management.  Pls consider running this by management and or some focus groups, if in fact, the package is under review.

Ask everyone to send you the info to fill in the blanks (and to copy the others on the list).  Perhaps you could join in on Oxley's 6:00 call...I'll ask by copy of this message.

Will do.  How do you want to go about collecting comments?  Best thing might
be to have everyone review it and then get around the table to go over it
and hash out any issues.

I'm sorry ... I told mom, Phil and Karen, but not you... Francis died two weeks ago.  Norma is fine.  She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas).

How is Francis doing?

Melissa's mom will be coming, so we will be sticking around Hous.

Steve,

Thanks for the information.  It looks like I have a sizable additional tax bill.  Am I missing something?  Do I have Enron stock I can sell to offset these gains (e.g. in my savings plan matching?  Other ideas?

Michelle - can you respond?  I haven't seen anything.  Also, after our meeting we had talked about making a proposal to them (specifically, we were at least going to describe the actions we took so they might have the opportunity to acknowledge that we had done enough).  I know everyone is busy, but I would like us to get ahead of this while we have a good environment for resolution.

Michelle and Steve,
Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review?  This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago.

Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay?  Can you please let me know?  Thanks so much.

Regards,
Sandra

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.

Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my Enron."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best.
Steve,

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 

I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.

Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.

Terrie
 

I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.

Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.

Steve--how was your call earlier this week with Norm Coleman (Republican running for US Senate from Minnesota).  Are we going to back him and is there anything I can do to assist?

As discussed.

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).

FYI please find attached a summary of what the media are saying about our cash position.  I've added the times I think the stories crossed, but that is just my best guess.
 

Please prepare the letter to McLarty for my signature.  Please get me his phone number and get his fax number, so we can fax as well as mail the letter.
Dear Steve:

As per your voicemail, I have reviewed the agreements between Enron Corp. and Kissinger Associates, Inc. and Enron Corp. and McLarty International, LLC.

I agree with your assessment that Enron can not legally terminate the agreement with Kissinger Associates, Inc. until May 20, 2002.

I also agree that we can terminate the relationship with McLarty International, LLC upon thirty days written notice.

Thus I have prepared two letters:
	
	1.  Letter from you to Mr. McLarty advising of Enron's termination of the Agreement effective November 21, 2001.  It needs to be sent tomorrow, November 21, 2001. 

	2.  Letter from Mr. Lay to Ambassador Paul Bremer advising of Enron's termination of the Agreement effective May 20, 2002.

I have tried to soften our standard notice.  Please revise each letter as necessary.  As per your voicemail, I will be happy to "tickle" the  letter to Ambassador Bremer until April, 2002.  However, I did not find any language in the Agreement which would prevent us from providing notice of termination at this time.

Thank you.

Sharon				 		 

I am terminating McLarty today.  We can't terminate with Kissinger yet.  I =
think we also need to terminate our agreement with Sue Walden.  Do you have=
 the agreement?

Please send out Notices of Termination by November 30, 2001 for all retaine=
r (fixed payments) agreements (lobbying, legal, consulting, etc...)  We nee=
d to end all payments as of December 31, 2001.  Thank you very much.

If you are checking e-mail, show this to Nora.
I showed you your test score, and I will return the tests after everyone
takes it.

Mrs. Ward

		 -----Original Message-----
		Dear Algebra Students,

		You successfully completed Trimester I, and we're headed
into Trimester II. As I'm sure you've already noticed, the material is
getting more and more challenging. You should also be aware that I will
be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses.
The Unit 4 Test is a good example of the thinking skills that I'd like
to see. The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and
required that you apply what we'd learned. Although the class average
was 73 on this test, and many of you scored lower than you normally do,
I think that we have to give ourselves credit for "passing" such a
challenging test. The best news is that your portfolio grades will more
than make up for a lower test score. One might say that I even planned
it that way. :-) Now, we have to get ready for the next test. It will be
a similar test in style and difficulty, and we won't be doing a
portfolio. So, you should take the Unit 4 Test and study the type of
questions that you missed. Don't worry...I know you can handle this! By
the end of the year, you will be a superb test taker and algebraist!

		PS: Don't forget to discuss your Unit 4 Test score with
your parents. They had to take challenging tests in their day (:-)), and
they can help you prepare for the types of questions (even if they've
forgotten some of the math).

		Mrs. Ward
		

Jeff worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.  Also know that I won't be talking to Jeff until next week.
Terry,

Per a vxmail I received from Steve Kean, Jeff Gray is no longer needed in his current rotation in Steve's group.  Steve recommends he be considered for other opportunities that may be available within the company.  Please make the appropriate notations within our spreadsheets.

Thanks,
Billy

Here is the draft forwarded to Dynegy

 

Any reason we couldn't do this?
Steve,
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy.  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties.  Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy.  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes.  Therefore, we can not "collaborate" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures.  Is this correct?   If so, how do you feel about the following?
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year.  The customer requires Enron to post collateral.  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer.  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a "back to back" transaction.   Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed.  
 
This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service.  We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer.  
 
Do you think this works?
 
Regards,
 
Chris

Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is "subject to extension" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a "business plan" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years ("Option 1-M"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years ("Option 2-M" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 ("Option 3-M" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining "Best Practices."  Although PJM also conducted a "best practices" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are "best practices."  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) "far outstrips" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that "impatience, haste and greed" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process "at the expense of sound policy" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint." See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom

This is an article that Irwin Stelzer wrote abut Enron.  He is willing to talk further.  His number is 202.777.3000.  He said he would like to have me on the phone when you call.

You should read this.  You won't like some of the comparisons, but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished.

What do you think?
It is unlikely that he will have any credible opposition in a primary.  Late last spring, there was a very well liked Republican state house member (assistant majority leader Tim Pawlenty) who was set to announce his candidacy, and the day before his announcement, Vice President Cheney called him and asked him not to run. This created a great furor in the press and the party for a short time.  Pawlenty agreed not to run, citing his desire that the party remain united so that we have a better chance of beating Wellstone. Although folks in the party were a tad miffed that Cheney was trying to be kingmaker, they ultimately want to win more than they want to put up other candidates.

Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor. Jessie Ventura, true to form, has said that he won't make up his mind until next summer!  If Ventura runs again, he has a very good chance of being re elected (he still has approval ratings in the 65-70% range).

As I mentioned earlier,  I don't believe that Wellstone will ever look at our issues in a rational or market oriented manner.  I tend to think that his votes will be just the same regardless of whether we back another candidate or not.

I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.

Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.

Steve--how was your call earlier this week with Norm Coleman (Republican running for US Senate from Minnesota).  Are we going to back him and is there anything I can do to assist?

thanks

 
Steve, here is the contact list that you requested.  By NO means is this a complete list, as I was not able to get hold of everyone in our group.  Christie will be back tomorrow and will add/delete/amend accordingly.  Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C, Northwestern, LSU, UT.
 
As an aside, I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and/or communications.  Enron's credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enron's key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they don't already know.
 
Hope this document helps in the interim.
 
Regards,
 
Cindy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Dear Steven Kean,
 
I am contacting you directly because you are the leader of Enron's educational initiatives.  I am hoping you will take a few minutes to allow me to introduce myself and my company.  I am sure you do not appreciate unsolicited mail, therefore, I apologize for this intrusion, but I believe I you will be interested in what I have to say. 
 
I am a founder in a fairly new company that is focused on a new technology for education.  We are building one-on-one relationships between major companies and universities.  We are not a distance learning company.  We do not provide content.  We simply provide a unique platform for people to communicate with each other over great distances, as though everyone involved were sitting in the same room.
 
My goal today is to provide you with information that could allow Enron to have direct links into university classrooms.  The possibilities include having Enron executives and managers attend a Stanford MBA program without having to travel to Palo Alto, or, attend a Harvard executive program, without having to leave the workplace.  Our plan is simple; Enron picks the school of its choice, we install digital classrooms at the school and at Enron.  Through the use of digital technology, these classrooms now become one.  Enron employees now attend the same class, in real time, that is being taught at a school or university.  The additional benefits to Enron are many; less time lost, all travel expenses saved, employee moral and retention, to name a few.  This also allows key executives to upgrade their skills that would normally not want to be away from their job and family.
 
My company, Telanetix, is building a network of "virtual" or digital? classrooms around the country to link major universities with major corporations.  Our digital classrooms" are unlike anything you have seen.  They appear as well appointed lecture rooms, but the front and back walls are high resolution video screens. There are no visible cameras or microphones.  Everyone in each room sees everyone else, people are life-sized, there is no latency, sound is directional, no panning or zooming is used, etc.  The technology is transparent to the participants, and this allows them to concentrate on each other.  The impression of the participants is that they are all in one large room.  No training is required to use the room...all that is required is for the participants to enter the room and start talking.
 
The digital classrooms are so real in its effect that this technology is being readily accepted among elite school as a means for distant education.  All classes or programs are exactly the same as being taught on campus today.  Prospective students still apply to the college of choice and are admitted through the same process as students who plan to attend class on campus.  All programs will have the full acceptance and accreditation of the school where the classes originate.
 
When it is all said and done, Telanetix becomes invisible.  We simply link the likes of Stanford, Harvard and MIT directly into corporate training centers.  Enron employees would interact directly with the University, and pay their tuition to the University.  Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students.
 
This technology is up and operating.  Our partner TeleSuite (Dayton, Ohio) has established about 25 conference rooms around the country with companies such as IBM, 3COM, CIGNA, Price Waterhouse Coopers and AOL-Time Warner.  The University of Arizona and Duke University also have rooms.  The University of Arizona is using a prototype of a teaching room to conduct two Executive MBA programs in the Silicon Valley (3COM) from their Tucson campus.  Duke uses the technology to communicate on administrative issues with their campus in Frankfurt, Germany.  Telanetix anticipates installing classrooms at Stanford University and the University of Maryland in the near future.  Additionally, we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia.
 
This technology is new and cutting-edge.  I hope Enron will consider joining the small, but growing list of companies that are bringing tier one education directly into the workplace.
 
In addition to using the digital classroom for higher education, all our business customers are using them for virtual conference rooms, usually between executives in different locations.  IBM, for example, has five of these rooms and is ordering five more because they have proven to be very cost effective as a means to reduce travel.  Why?  Because the conferencing is so profoundly real in its effect that the users feel as if they are all present in the same room.  This is not video-conferencing.  This is way beyond that.
 
As executive vice president and chief of staff for Enron, I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this.  I believe that we have a value proposition for Enron to consider.  I would very much like to demo our digital classroom to you and discuss the benefits and possibilities it might bring.  Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom.

I look forward to your response.
 
Sincerely,

Rick -- I'm so sorry to hear about this, but I'm glad the outlook is good.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Sent this out to my direct reports, but I wanted you to be aware as well.
 
Rick Buy
 
Most of you have gathered that I haven't been in the office much lately and I wanted to let you why and I am doing it via email so I don't have to say it many times.
 
I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth, specifically the lower right side of my tongue. My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area.  This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination. MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday (the 11th). I have been at home recovering since. It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better. I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam. Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow- up treatments will be necessary.
 
I have missed several critical meetings and just haven't "been around" but I wanted everyone to know that its not because I've lost interest. 
 
Thanks for patience, Rick

Thank you.  I look forward to seeing you again in the interview process.

Dear Mr. Kean,
It was a pleasure meeting you at the Enron Site Tour. I would like to thank you sincerely for taking time out of your schedule to come speak to us and encourage us to apply to Enron. I personally found Enron to be a very exciting opportunity, and I am definitely interested in pursuing a career at your company. Your presentation and our conversation gave me insight to your firm, to your company culture, and to the responsibilities an analyst has at Enron. I found this information to be very valuable, for it confirmed my interest in your firm. Specifically, the innovative atmosphere you foster has appealed to me very much. I would like to thank you again for inviting us to Enron.  

Sincerely,
Ricky Kalra

I'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).  Perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forward-looking thrust of the conference -- e.g. a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go.  

Steve and Cindy,

Below is the message I'm intending to send out to the business units about the Management Conference "Home Video" project.  I wanted to be sure you were both comfortable with the direction I'm providing and the topics being proposed.  (Of course, I'm allowing the businesses to generate their own as well.)

As for who is to receive the "challenge," here's a potential list:
Enron Corp.: Rick Causey, Andy Fastow, Mark Frevert, Steve Kean, Mark Koenig, Ken Lay, Greg Whalley
EES: Dave Delainey, Janet Dietrich
ETS: Stan Horton, Dan McCarty
Industrial Markets: Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen
Enron Europe: John Sherriff, Michael Brown
Enron Broadband:  Jim Fallon, Rich DiMichelle
Enron Americas: John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen
Global Markets: Mike McConnell, Jeff Shankman
Enron Net Works: Greg Piper, Sally Beck

(I also intend to cc the memo to all the communication people: Mark Palmer, Gina Taylor, Kal Shah, Eric Thode, Beth Tilney, John Ambler, and me.)

Let me know if you have any changes or comments.  To allow plenty of time to produce these videos, I hope to get this memo out later this week.

  
The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, ane even poke fun and laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  Some ideas include:
Accounting Procedures
Cost Cutting
Deal Making
Innovation
Management Changes
PRC
Public Relations
Reorganizations
Stock Price
Trading/Traders

There are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intentions to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be granted for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.  Good luck and happy filming!

For your information.  Should Ken respond to the reporter?

Dear Mr. Lay

I am a reporter with The Asian Wall Street Journal and I understand that you
have written to the Indian Prime Minister to complain about the Indian
government's lack of co-operation regarding Dabhol. Is it correct that Enron
is now threatening to sue the Indian government, MSEB and GOS for a total of
US$ 4 bn to US$ 5 billion ?

I am very interested in pursuing this story given the lack of action by the
Indian authorities and wonder if you would be kind enough to verify that you
have indeed sent this letter to the Prime Minister

Thank you for your help, Sara Webb

Steve - please let me know when you 30 minutes when you're back in Houston. Thanks.  MEK

Either with you/or your transportation manager.  We are hearing that lots of
companies are rethinking their commercial travel for execs and that companies
are stepping up further in their purchases of Fractional Jet shares as well as
rethinking their entire fleet.  No rush.  Feel free to email or call me
(cellphone = 303-808-8292).  thanks, br

I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.  

As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.

There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.

I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks.

I think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.  More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything.

Steve

I and my fellow HR VP's are volunteering on Monday to spend the first 2 hours of our day checking id's and that security pass pictures match individuals using them before letting them in the building. In fact, I am planning to order some peaked caps and t-shirts with SECURITY emblazened on them today. Robert and I are also going to Best Buy tomorrow to pick up a couple of those hand held metal detector wands to waive around..........................I could go on.

The security stinks, our employees do not feel comforted and we need to do something about it. I am prepared to do it myself!

Johanna,

These are excellent ideas.   David/Robert, can we incorporate into our overall approach?

Good Morning Kalen--

Since the attack on America, last week, 9/11/01--Life as we know it will never be the same.  Although, as a nation, ( individuals) we are trying to recover & put the pieces back, we know the journey ahead will be hard ( especially after what Bush discussed last night).  I bring this up for several reasons; as an American & an Enron employee.  After talking w/ Enron employees, about terrorists attacks, possible cell groups in our own back yard--we are fearful--this is an understatement.  However, we know, as employees, the importance of getting back to the work, Enron is paying us to do.  How do we balance the two?  I have some ideas I have shared with Leasa & Judy--I'd like to suggest them to you, as I feel they are steps we can put into place to help our Enron employees feel safe.

1)Let's have an evacuation drill
2) On your floor know where the nearest stairwell (s) are located
3) Someone assigned to a handicapped employee--in the event of an evacuation--this person would ensure they get out safely
4) Update floor/ fire warden--who are they?  Leasa told me that the one on our floor is from 1998
5) Have one or two contacts in each group that would be responsible for making sure everyone knew what was happening in the event of an evacuation ( people come in @ different times etc...)
6) Vent/ talk meetings w/ managers over lunch ( see paragraph #2 for explanation)

Also, I do not think it is unreasonable to think some of our employees are suffering from ( or will suffer from) Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome! I propose that managers/ leaders of groups hold a "vent/ talk" meeting--over lunch--where employees can feel free to talk about their concerns, fears, anger etc..--It is so important that we do this.  If not some of the repercussions may be people resigning -for fear of working downtown/ in a high-rise etc...( Judy & I talked about this). 

I feel this is an opportunity for HR to really make a difference/ contribute/ & have a strong impact, in assuring our employees we are taking active measures to ensure their safety & want to address their feelings.    I'd like to know what your thoughts are on this?  If you'd like to discuss the further, I'd welcome the opportunity.

Thank you for your time.

Here is the electronic copy.

 

This relates to the EPA region 9 issue we discussed last week

FYI gents - the meeting yesterday with the Arizona DEQ did not result in significant progress. Basically the agency folks at that level are simply not motivated to engage in any effort to accelerate the permitting.  Local counsel is going to visit informally today with the agency's counsel to see if some progress can be made and attempt to set a meeting with higher level agency personnel early next week.  

Attached is a copy of a hand out that was used at yesterday's meeting.  

Has Koenig seen the IR section?  I don't agree with the statement that they have not done a good job communicating with analysts and investors.  I can't believe he would think that's accurate.

Steve and Karen,

Here is the latest draft of the Lay It On the Line memo from Ken.  Cindy made some signficant changes this morning.  Some of the action items removed were mandatory vacation, leadership training, online communications training, the function of Employee Relations and the employee task force.   Mary and I agree that, as it stands now, there is not nearly enough "meat" to warrant a communication to employees.  Sending out a memo with a "theoretical" approach and few significant, tangible action items will backfire.  As an FYI, I was told by several people, including one in HR, that employees are reacting very sensitively to any changes that are announced.  I think we should wait to communicate this until we have solid, positive action items.

... some recent history.  I had left the message with Rogers Herndon.
You are correct!  This is not a new issue, but it seems to resurface on a r=

connection with the license and regularly thereafter) and each time the bus=
iness has said not to worry, if they can't cut a deal with New Power they w=
ill just pay the $1/MW.  EES has assumed it will pay the $1/MW since day on=

 It is my understanding, and Jim, please comment if my information is "stal=

 which allows us to make a payment into the System Benefit Fund.  This appr=

Ed,

Residential Obligation
Section 39.352(g) of Senate Bill 7 provides that for any REP serving an agg=
regate load in excess of 300 MW, 5% of the load must consist of residential=
 customers. A REP can fulfil this requirement by:
1. Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to 5% o=
f its total load
2. That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf, or
3. It pays 1 dollar per MWH of required 5% load into the System Benefit Fun=
d.
 EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power=
 to serve residential load on its behalf, or can pay the 1$ per MWH penalty=
.
There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate=
 compliance if it has an agreement with New Power.

EES Contract,
For price to beat customers, the utilities have by Commission rule, the obl=
igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the 5 year =
period conmmencing 1/2/02. The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab=
use this provision by gaming the system. The Enron contracts as currently w=
ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission. Until the utilit=
ies move to amend the relevant rules, the Commission can only exercise its =
displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond=
uct amounts to abuse and gaming. I think it will ultimately be a question o=
f degree and pattern of switching. The onus will be on the affiliated REPs =
to prove abuse and gaming. Fundamentally, it is in the best interest of the=
 market to allow customers to come and go. Customer mobility is the best cu=
stomer protection in a competitive market. Besides, a restraint on customer=
 mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c=
ustomer inertia. The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t=
o insure that they achieve a reasonable balance. For larger than 1MW custom=
ers, they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their abili=
ty to come and go.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria
get on this.  we need to discuss

Everyone - =20

I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Ener=
gy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class/indu=
strial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed =
(300 Mw of industrial rate class load). =20

EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements.  Therefore, I ca=
nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement.  However, it i=
s something we definitely need to look into.  In addition, we (EPMI/EWS) ar=
e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they =
see the pilot and the market structure unfolding.  Specifically, they are n=
ot pleased with retail energy providers' contracts that contemplate the rig=
ht to switch between direct access and tariff (and visa-versa).  We will mo=
nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their =
displeasure.

On the residential requirement front, someone needs to address this.  Speci=
fically, is this true.  If so, what rate classes are considered industrial =
vs. commercial?  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load?  Is TI=
 considered industrial?  Do we already have industrial customers in our por=
tfolio?  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke=
ts?

Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe=
ctive as they are focusing on more of the pure, large industrial customers.=
  We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group.=20

I don't think we should require employees to walk around with their badges displayed.  I don't think they will and I think it will undermine the other measures we are trying to take.  Also, I want us to have sufficient additional security to do the badge checks to ensure we don't slow down the "badge in" process.  The other recommendations look fine to me.  I have left a voicemail for Greg for his approval.

Steve - below are the initial measures we believe we can take starting Wednesday.  The problem is guard force manpower.  The increased demands are so great now that the current force is working two 12 hour shifts instead of three 8 hour shifts.  We will be putting in a request for more guards in the next couple of days, but it takes 3 weeks for them to be hired and trained by the contractor.

Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit.  Also - would you like the email to come from you, the Office of the Chairman, or business controls? 

Text of Message:

Due to recent events, Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world.  As part of this increased security effort, beginning Wednesday morning, September 26, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and, where applicable, at other Enron facilities:

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building, a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer.

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility.  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders.

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building (U.S. 	driver's	 license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card.  Visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, 	or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Building.

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a 	visitor's log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  	At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	   

Thanks for the update.  Your approach makes sense to me.

As you may know, Enron has ceased all funding of the efforst made by the Energy Services Coalition an entity that it was instrumental in establishing.  However, Linda recognised that we could not completely abandon our involvement with the ESC and the USTR effort to negotiate an energy services section of GATS.  Otherwise, Enron would risk damaging its reputation within USTR and among the other members of the coalition.  In fact, carol Ballassa of USTR spoke with me privately about her concern (and, alledegedly, Zoellick's concern) that Enron would abandon the effort. Therefore, Linda set me on the task to "rationalize" our ESC involvement.

Upon further scrutiny of the ESC effort, it became apparent that the GATS effort on energy services had absolutely nothing to do with deregulation or liberalisation of the energy sector.  In fact, mention of open access - particularly gas pipelines - caused some of the ESC members to break out into a cold sweat.  Unfortunately, few, if any, of the energy services that could be provided by Enron can be offered in a monopoly market.  Therefore, there was little for Enron to gain in these negotiations unless the deregulation was adressed as a prerequisite to opening trade in energy services.

I met privately with the USTR negotiating team and made the case that deregulation had to part of the negotiating agenda.  Otherwise, I told her that there would be little to gain for Enron and we would not be an active participant as a result.

We met today with USTR and other members of the coalition and in fact, deregulation was on the USTR negotiating agenda.  GE and Enron supported the way in which USTR would raise the issue in negotiations, but other members of the ESC (from the oil and gas sector) objected strenuosly to pipeline access provisions.  As it stands, the ESC will split or fold on this provision.  If the USTR agrees to water down its negotiating provision, they know that Enron will likely leave the ESC.  If the provision remains, then the USTR effort may actually prove beneficial to Enron in the long run. Regardless of the outcome, Enron's time and expenditure on this effort will be minimal to non-existant.

If you have any questions, please call.

FYI
FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

Best,

Jeff

Please see attached revised travel advisory.  I think it does a better job of balancing the competing interests.

Steve - 

Attached is suggested language for our updated travel policy.  Our plan is to send out the update via email and to post it on home.enron.com under "new and notable" as well as on the Corporate Security website under "bulletins."

Please let us know if you would like us to change anything or if this is what the management committee had in mind.  Thanks!

No word yet. I will also be seeing Barton tomorrow. 

FYI,  I am speaking at his Texas Conservative forum in Austin.  
Have Mr. Lay and Congressman Barton done their follow-up call about the Texas Senate race?  This conversation remains a priority with Joe.  In addition to Barton's solid efforts on our key issues, his change in viewpoint having been noted in the trade press, he has agreed to participate in the opening dinner panel at the Genie conference.  

I think it would be nice to work this out before the Genie conference next week.  If that's impossible for scheduling reasons, perhaps we could arrange time before the Genie dinner session when they could meet face to face.

I know Joe came away from his earlier conversation feeling good about it, and if Ken's inclination is to support him, it's probably better to do it sooner rather than later.  The secondary question that arises is, if Ken isn't comfortable with an endorsement, can Enron's PAC support the exploratory effort regardless?

Per my voicemail.

I'll be seeing Barton today in Austin and will make these points as well.  
Here are Barton talking points per our conversation last night.  We will separately send a favorable Washington Post article on FERC's meeting yesterday as it relates to RTOs.

 

I wrote a letter of recommendation for you (you're getting it whether you want it or not).

 

Yes and yes

Hi Steve

With regard to your visit to London at the end of October I have a couple of questions ...

1.  Would you like me to accompany you on your visit to the British Airways HQ, as I'm not sure whether anyone else from Enron Europe will be going?

2.  Can we make time on your schedule to meet with the Enron Europe PR team for an hour or so?  I'm sure it would be much appreciated.

Thanks, and looking forward to seeing you.

Jackie

I spoke with Jimmy Glotfelty on Friday.  The message they are stressing is that FERC is injecting much needed certainty.  I think we should add that to our message as well.

How we frame "RTO week" could have a big impact on what, if anything, happens legislatively between now and the end of the session.  While we all realize that what Pat Wood laid out last week was of enormous import, I don't think we can afford to allow that to become the conventional wisdom.  

In fact, that will be the message of our opponents: "Pat Wood turned the world upside down last week.  He went off in a radical direction that he doesn't even possess the authority to go in.  You have to do something before his December 15th deadline."

I believe we have to consistently send the message that "he went in a direction that's perfectly consistent with previous commission orders fitting with previously set timeframes.  It's the action you'd expect a new chairman to take in order to get his arms around a big and possibly contentious issue."  

We should point out that he took a very middle-of-the-road approach.  We can contrast what Pat Wood laid out versus a more radical approach that he didn't take.

The more often we can aggressively drive media coverage and send signals in the press, especially in DC,  that this is orderly business as usual with no need for outside intervention, the more likely we are to avoid legislative action.

On top of the day to day activity to drive this message, I think we should look at some media briefings, probably a combination of conference calls and one-on-one interviews.  Sooner would be better than later given the truncated legislative schedule.

I would like to see him if it works on my schedule
And would like to know if you're available to see him either in the morning or the evening of October 10th.  Mike's number is 415-392-7900.

Thank you. I enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience.  And yes I am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well.

thanks so much for the note.  I remember our trip to Dubuque very well.  My father asked about you many times after that visit we had the evening before our meeting.  I am glad you are well and wish you the very best for the holidays and the new year (I'll be glad when this one is over).

Steve,
I am very disappointed to learn that you will leave the company.  I remember you as that real go-getter who learns new words each week.  During our trip to Dubuque, the word was "elect" and I have elected to adopt that term many times since.  You have remained a bright light to me as I followed your success.  I am saddened that you will be some place else.  But you will always be a friend.

Siegal is available for Friday morning.  I'm to receive a tape today or tomorrow.  I'll run it by you so you can compare Siegel to Stelzer.  

Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing

Steve,

I'm looking into Siegel's availability now.  Do you consider Mr. Stelzer a strong alternative to Freund or Siegel?

Freund is very good, but Siegel is more on top of things; his book is very 
good. I am better than both and wouldn't have the nerve to charge you.    
Irwin

I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).

The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).

Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.

Good Morning.

Attached is a draft of our open enrollment communication per Cynthia's voice mail message.  In order to meet our mailing deadlines, I would like to get your comments/changes today if possible.

Hi Steve,
I wanted to extend my sincere thanks to you for coming to Rice to
interview and recruit. It was so enjoyable meeting you and having the
opportunity to chat about Enron. I had a great experience there this
summer, and I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for a

I believe I sent this to you earlier.  Pankaj is a Harvard Bus School professor who sits on our advisory council.  He is putting together a program (in Barcelona, I believe) and would like an Enron executive to present.  I said I would try to find someone from Enron Europe and gave him your name.  Would you mind getting in touch with Pankaj?

Steve,

Any luck finding anybody from Enron to come and talk on October 18 at the

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

I will bring John BRindle.

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks 

Pete

anytime after 3 pm today  i will be leaving today at 4.45

please call me  in the am,  i want to know again the term, and the basis

Please plan to attend a Gas Weather Financial Option meeting (new product), 
Wed., Oct. 4, 4:00-5:00 PM, in EB-2988.
Any questions, contact Sanjeev Khanna at Ext. 3-5167.

I assume that the tokenized products for gas daily and daily basis with 
continue to be coded for my book on a forward basis.   I also am assuming 
that the Henry Hub products have been moved to FT East who is now managing 
them.

Thanks for your help

Pete

Please approve my authorization request for control over daily and monthly  
basis products on enrononline.  
I will need these products available for management on my stack manager. I 
currently cannot access basis products on my stack manager.  They were 
removed to facilitate timely messaging updates between my stack and the 
website.  
I will be managing monthly and daily  basis products for the East Desk.   I 
will also be retaining my management of gas daily products for the east desk.
I will be managing these products as of 10/2/2000.

Please call id there anre any problems

I am putting through an offsetting trade where I am selling 75,000 to you at 
flat.  You will recieve confirms for both trades.  

I just  spoke to Jeff and he is interested in talking to you.  He saw your 
name on some kind of list for "redeployment" and asked if I knew you.   The 
job is in his fundamental analysis group.  He wants you to send your resume 
today.

Pete

Jeff,

since Dutch is still out could you take care of this ??  I'm not exactly sure 
what he is talking about.  The trades should be part of a spread in whcich 
reliant is also buying or selling the hub.  
Thanks

	
	

Pete,

I'm seeing some trades with your name as Trader which are at extremely high 
prices.   Transco Z6 vs. Henry Hub trades at prices of $15.6025 from Trade 
Date of 12/5.  Are these errors?  EOL numbers are 658961 and 658985 (both 
with Reliant).  No confirmation has been sent on these.  Please have your 
Book Admin notify me as soon as you get a chance to look at these.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Hey Peter, Could you pass this on to the proper person. For the past week or
so, we've been getting some very low prices from Enron in the San Juan
Basin. The non-Bondad and Bondad price have been the same, and non-Bondad
been very much below the rest of the market especially considering the
volume reported. Today, I understand you posted a 4.145 for your online
trading average. You reported 4.07 for 600,000 to us. What gives? Thanks. T

Dale,

Here are the confirms for the Gas Daily option products that I need created.  
The product has no special requirements for setting the strike etc.  
if there are any questions please call me asap. I would like to have these 
products online by the October expiry which is next wWednesday.  
Please let me know when it will be possible

Thanks

Let me know if this is OK

i don't think our rosters have a good trade match because i'm sure you are 
not ready to deal Davis and Robinson. Ricky was my # 1 pick for a reason and 
Warrick is the only decent receiver in Cin.  the two guys you are offering 
are not top players.  

Rickey is always available for the right price 

i would need a starting WR for him though as part of the package

Richard,

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  

Call me to go over the numbers if you want

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

John

Please create today the September  GDD/IF swap and the september Gas Daily 
Henry Hub swap. 

Thanks

I put in an offsetting trade for the phys/financial swap.  You will have to 
process three confirmations to get it done 2 offsetting phys and 1 
financial.

Sorry guys, I was on vacation yesterday.  Here are the photos.  Some of you 
have asked......the furniture is four years old.  My husband and I both work 
outside the home, so it has really just been used to surf the internet and do 
family finances.  It is in great condition.  Come over any evening or weekend 
and see for yourself.  We still like it, but we have to give up our study to 
make room for the twins we are expecting in September!  Mima, I would prefer 
to keep all the pieces together, but I may consider selling the bookcase 
separately, I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

John Arnold has a few qquestions about the updates that were/are being made 
to stack manager.  I could not remember from our conversation a few days ago 
if the changes were implemented yet. please could you give myself or John a 
call sometime this morning

Pete 3x7277

John 3x3230

Louise,

Thanks for your reply to my email.  

The fixes implemented over the weekend appear to have worked extremely well.  

I am sure that the changes your team made also contributed to the record  147 
external and 263 total trades that I executed today.

Thanks for all your help.

Pete Keavey

Louise,

Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the 
unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet 
technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have 
gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a 
trader on the system it has been very frustrating.  

Regards, 

Pete Keavey

I will attend

Was this the longest year of your life or what??

Kyle is doing fine. Larry is doing pretty well.  We are actually buying Z6 
vol for the first time in years.  

As far as the rest of the stuff I am so far outside the loop on these things 
my desk has a different zip code.  

Later

https://ecthou-webcl1.ect.enron.com/gas/

Is it possible that the Gas Daily swaps that you set up for the west are not 
mapped for our other gas dailly locations??

That may be the cause of some of our confusion

Dale,

To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short 
description. We would like to make in simpler. 

Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type

Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve 
while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the 
product is created ???

As an update to my e-mail below, the EnronOnline focus group with traders

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in

$100 is waiting on 31

US Gas

Liquidity

EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external 
customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial 
products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and 
receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes 
and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to 
allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled 
through third party brokers.  

Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer 
spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since 
rollout last Nov.29.

Transparency

The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness 
of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and 
offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on 
the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and 
competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading 
vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on 
as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no 
competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the 
smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  

Deal Flow

As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading 
benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and 
over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market 
share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become 
the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.         

 

The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for 
existing products in the next few weeks. 
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas 
Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some 
work. 
I should have a list of new locations shortly.

Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things 
happen.  

Thanks,

Pete 

I forgot to create the Hub swap for 18-31 till today. Please activate it

Sorry,

He has told me that at least 10 times.

Thanks 

Jeanie,

I work in the ENA gas trading dept and understand that you are our HR rep.  I 
would like to speak to you briefly about a benefits issue relating to the 
legal custody of a child.  Please call me at 3x7277 at your convenience and I 
will give you the details. 

Thanks

oh how the truth hurts. As a Texas resident i can tell you that Bush is by 
far the worse of these two evils.  Never has a more expensive suit been 
filled by such cheap intellect (or lack thereof).  But as usual whoever is 
elected will make no difference anyway.   

      
 

Colleen,

It is AGA day could we change the time?

Hi Peter,

I was just wondering if you had any update for me.  

Thanks,

Pete Keavey

Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this.   However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the "back burner"and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

I will be handing out move packets today. However, I need your login and password, before I can give you the packet.

Kimberly Bates
East Gas/Origination
713-853-5193
713-646-8453 Fax

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Hi Al,

I got the email.  We didn't have any flight  plans made yet anyway.  The bachelor party sounds like it will be fun as long as us married guys can get away. I haven't been to Vegas ever so that would be fun for me.  We should stay at the Belagio if it is available for a decent price.  August is offseason in Vegas right??   Those party  days are too far behind me to remember right now.  I need a weekend away so I can get some  sleep.  If you want to feel your age just get a few kids and get no sleep for a few months.  You have the right address for me but it isn't in an Italian neighborhood we don't allow any down here.  

Remember that the Baptism for Caroline  is Saturday August 4th  in NJ. We are having a dinner after at a place nearby the church I hope you both can make it.  It should be at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.   

Talk to you soon 

Pete

I wanted to make sure you got my email that we changed wedding by 2 weeks.
the new date is sep 22. Also we are starting to make plans for a bachelor
party Aug 24 and 25 in Las Vegas.It would be great if you can come. Hope all
is well with family and especially baby Caroline. We got picture the other
day very beautiful. You sure you are the father? Talk to you soon. Also
confirm your address for me. I have 8910 Bace dr(are you in an Italian
neighborhood?) Houston 77055  see you soon

ok ,let me know where and when

Kevin/Peter/Eric

We are holding 32 interviews for the ENA Trading Track this Thursday, November 1st from 2.30 pm onwards.   Your names have been passed to me by Hunter Shively.    Can you please confirm you can interview at this time.   All the interviewers are gas & power traders.

Kind regards,

The following will be the deal entry procedures for UBSWEnergy:

Financial
1.  All non-electronic financial deals to be entered directly by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 

Physical
1.  All current month physical deals to be booked directly into Sitara by front office (logistics/trading)
2.  All non-electronic prompt month forward deals to be booked directly into TDS by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 
	 - physical meters to be added by logistics/trading

We would like to change the Netco directory name to UBS.

We will have to change the links to the NGP&L and anything else that links to files in Netco.  Let me know this morning if that will be a major problem for anyone.

Thanks

Z,

Attached are the files that need to be copied for the Netco files.

 
I will get you the list of curves tomorrow and you should talk to Louise for a list of the Netco traders.

Thanks

Kam

We all need to sit down again.

Then who is my strongest person? I do not know anything about Kristen. I prefer at least one aggressive person on the desk, Monte and Ashley are kind of shy.

Scott,  

I really think that Melissa would be able to handle Storey better than Kristen.  I think we should keep her on Central and let you take Kristen on the East.

Are you ok with that?

KK

Ashely,

I noticed that there isn't a wacog being used in your P&L.  Currently it is taking the UA4 volume and multiplying it by $0, it needs to have a dollar value in cell M83 on the physical tab.

Thanks

Ok, once that is done, we need to set up the RMS access query to extract the new VaR and dump it in the positions by trader spreadsheet.

KK

No, they are not.  Risktrac DB not set up for NETCO.  Jeff just talked to me.  He wants it all done by Friday.  Will do.  Just can't take excuses anymore from idiots and need to go around them.

Do you know if all of our books are set up and ready to go in risktrac, ready to report VaR?  

KK

Do you know if all of our books are set up and ready to go in risktrac, ready to report VaR?  

KK

Thank you.
 

Kam,
 
Here's an example of the file we use to reconcile one book from the DPR to G/L.  If you need me to walk someone through this, just let me know.
 
thanks

Brian,

In an effort to keep things consistent at UBS we have tried to perfect a roll spreadsheet that all regions should use.  We added extra rolls so we should never have to add rolls.  We have saved copies for our new P&L's in O:erms\erms_adm\netco\2002\0102\Regions0102 (this will be out new regions file until further notice.  

Can you copy one of those files and use that as your new P&L's?  Let me know if you see a problem in doing that.  We are trying to start linking up all new P&L's to the DPR, can you save yours out to that file when you are ready.  

Thanks

Kam

Luchas,

We didn't run any reports daily for anyone.  There is the DPR that needs to be updated and sent to Showna twice a week that Thomas is doing, Bankruptcy books calculated and post-id's sent to credit daily, and broker quotes need to be saved daily.

Other than that, we were doing mini-books or other requests as they came. 

Kam,

I need your help on something.   I am trying to compile a listing of all reports that were being run by the Risk leads and Specialist on a daily basis for the estate.  If you could please give me a general idea of the daily reports that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip  or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate.  I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.  

Thanks
Luchas

I will also be leaving for vacation tomorrow and returning whenever the hell I feel like it.

: )

FYI!

I will be taking vacation starting Monday and returning February 22nd.

done

FYI....Can you make sure this gets done?
Attached is a spreadsheet representing additional Counterparties who have terminated their relationship with ENA.  There aren't enough deals to involve IT, so can you please have your Risk groups move the attached deals to the Bankruptcy books.  

(There is a tab for Nat Gas and one for EIM (Paper))

Thanks,

In the Bedroom looks better.

KK

Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?

Mandi

Kelly will be a power trader.  I don't know if she has any experience doing that.  
I haven't heard exactly why the weather group left, but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers.  I think that's what happened with them.  
Good luck with everything, it would be great to work with you again.

KK

Is Kelly doing structuring over there or is it a risk job? Any details on the weather guy(s) walkout?  Sounds like a good opportunity but why did they all leave?  I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company? I have a few things presently in the works. I'm hoping to touch base with Scott N. sometime today. Too bad I couldn't make a living by being a frequent job switcher.  I could be good at that.  Things would be a hell of a lot easier if I was willing to take a job out of state.  Lots available elsewhere..

See ya,

JR

>I don't have any contacts at Duke.  Kelly Little will be working there, but other than that I don't know anyone.  Have you called Scott Neal back yet?  We were just talking about that exact thing, we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do.  That would be a great opportunity for you.

Hi Kam,

I have already applied there online last week but I am afraid that it may have gone into that great HR black hole. Thank you for the heads up, though.  Do you have any contacts there?  Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?

Hi Kam,
 
Could you send us your updated address?  Yahoo says you still live on 4444 Westheimer, which I know is wrong.  We would like to send you a wedding invite.  Have a happy holiday.
 
Take care,
 
JR

We are working on this now.  We have a book with all physical active trades we will be performing on, we are now working on getting the in-the-money financial trades separated into a new book.  Once that book is ready and deals are moved, we will be able to report it to you.  

Thanks,

Kam

Who in gas is taking the ball to figure this out?

Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

So think about how we get there.

let me know

bob

I know what we consider performing on the physical side.  What is considered performing on the financial side?????  

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!

There is a new directory for the curve files.  I am trying to request access to this for the traders so they can't see the rest of our files.

This should be done soon.

Can you move your files to this drive today?

 
Sanjeev,

Could you run the detail for these post-id's in grey.  These are the physical post-id's that were excluded from the original request.  You don't need to run the other post-id's, just the new column I.

Thanks again,

Kam

John,

There is another report that needs to be added to our daily duties, it is currently only being done once a month by accounting.

I'll show it to you in the morning.

are Darren and Phillip doing this?

what is the time line for having these deals killed.

let me know.

thanks

bob

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hal,

There will be some changes to be made to this list.  We should know more later this week.

Thanks

I have highlighted the files and names that should move over.  I had to add some names to the bottom of the ERV files.

Thanks

Kathy,

Vladi asked me to give you a call.  I will be out of the office until about 2:00 today so I wanted to let you know what we did to populate Form A.
We gave all post-id's that were calculated on Nov-30th to Zhiyong Wei.  From there, he dumped all of that information into excel and we formatted it from there into the required buckets.  It will take a few hours for IT to get the file ready to use so I recommend getting that together ASAP.

Let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks

Jeff, 

There is a meeting at the Houstonian tomorrow morning.  Is this one for us or did they split the group into seperate meetings?

KK

My e-mail will change on Friday to kam.keiser@UBSWEnergy.com

Arnold, Kevin Ruscitti, Brad McKay are the only ones so far.  I'm sure there are a few more I don't know about yet.

How is your group looking, who's left, are you in charge now?

Who, so far, has decided to leave (besides John Arnold)?

FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

Thanks,

Kam

Number of people				55
Average number of transactions per day	1,674

Yes, unless they find something on my background check....cross my fingers.

How about you?

Are you going to UBS?

Here you go.

My memory needs refreshing as I'm noticing curve type codes and risk type codes that I don't know.

Curve Type Code:
AP [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Price	 
AV [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Volatility 
BP [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Price 
BV [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Volatility 
PR [Keiser, Kam]  	Forward Price 
SP [Keiser, Kam]  	Settle Price	 
VO [Keiser, Kam]  	Volatility 

Book type code:
D [Keiser, Kam]  	Basis 
I [Keiser, Kam]  	Index	 
M [Keiser, Kam]  	intra-month and gas daily 
P [Keiser, Kam]  	price	 
X [Keiser, Kam]  	Exchange 

I should probably be shot for forgetting this stuff, but your help will be appreciated.
Thanks

Yes, that is the correct set up for now.

Can you handle this?

Thanks

I am forwarding Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU.  Please calculate our MTM values on those dates as soon as you can, and forward them to me.  Thank you.
Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.

 << File: TXU Default Log.xls >> 

I'm about to send this.  This counterparty name was inactivated and we had to manually change the name on about 200+ deals.

Please let me know where we stand on this.

Thanks

If possible, please forward these MTM values to me by the end of the day.  I'd like to get back together for a short meeting tomorrow to discuss the values and make plans for next steps.  Tina Holcombe will send out an email for meeting time later today.  Thanks.

Thanks for making those changes.  Let us know when we are ready to start setting up the hierarchy.

Thanks

Kam

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:

FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Russ,

I want everyone in risk to have access to all regions.  Traders should only have access to their own.

Thanks

KK

I still need a list of people who need Netco Sitara access for the East and Central Regions.

Russ
Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Kam,

I found the following comment in Global Counterparty regarding the suspension of TXU Energy Trading Company (CP ID 69034):

 

Cheryl Johnson in the GCP group suspended this record due to the merger which resulted in the final name of TXU Energy Trading Company LP.  It sounds like deals need to be moved over to the new CP name.  You will need to coordinate that with Cheryl because she will have to re-activate the CP ID to do that.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.

Thanks

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Kam,

Jeremy was asking me about those "Financial" regions...  Do you want to use uppercase instead of lowercase so that they are consistent with Global (All uppercase in Global)?

Let me know, thanks.

Cecilia

One more thing - Financial (long/short name and org. region) is lowercase whereas all the other books are uppercase?

Thanks.

Regarding issue (1) below:

The reason I do not see MP and MD in ermt/estermtp is that the counterparties are not in global
and my script to check joins with tagg_global_cp also.

Since these are physical books with deals flowing from Sitara->CPR, we should be ok.

Thanks.

(1) What are the book names/codes for Canadian P/B/I?

(2) Don't see M P and M D for the physical (no hedge) books?

(3) For M C (Canadian GasDaily), for book, egs_cand_yn = 'N' (not 'Y'). 

Thanks.

The attached file summarizes all MTM value by counterparty, in and out-of-the-money trades, physical and financial.  You can filter column A for P or F and or column IV for positive or negative values.

Please call me if you have any questions.

FYI....

I changed the west and performance books to your name on the rac website.

Do we have to do anything for this???
 
 
We are trying to wrap up the year end reporting this week.  Please let me know if you are still having issues reporting and/or when to expect the year end data.  Some of you may not be familiar with the "export" process to get data to the Consolidated DPR.  If not, please call me and I can help.

Kristen,

Once Zhiyong gets me the information, how would you like this handled?  Do you want me to fill out the Schedule A, or would you rather have pivot tables similar to Todd Hall's for each scenario?

Bob,

Here are all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night.
The summary tab gives you the deal count and MTM value by month, the next tab breaks the value down by counterparty if needed.
I already sent this to Kristen. 

 
Here are the performance deals as well, James may have already sent this to you...

 
Let me know if there is anything I left out.

Thanks

This request is saved in O:\_dropbox\Kam\In-the-money trades\Summary.xls.  The file is too large to attach. 
It reflects all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night. 

The summary tab gives you the total deal count and MTM value by month.  The next tab will break out the value by counterparty by month.

Please let me know if this is everything you need.

Thanks

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

Stephen,

I made a copy of your BenchbyTrader and cleaned it up a little by taking out all the hidden rows and old traders.  It is saved to the same directory as UBS BenchByTrader.xls

Can you look at this and check the macros to make sure it all still works?  Can you use that going forward?

Thanks

Can you please take care of this for the estate curve files?  It will have to be done on your machine, Ashely, for you to be able to load them after today.

Thanks

KK

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      

Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Here you go.

My memory needs refreshing as I'm noticing curve type codes and risk type codes that I don't know.

Curve Type Code:
AP [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Price	 
AV [Keiser, Kam]  	Ask Volatility 
BP [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Price 
BV [Keiser, Kam]  	Bid Volatility 
PR [Keiser, Kam]  	Forward Price 
SP [Keiser, Kam]  	Settle Price	 
VO [Keiser, Kam]  	Volatility 

Book type code:
D [Keiser, Kam]  	Basis 
I [Keiser, Kam]  	Index	 
M [Keiser, Kam]  	intra-month and gas daily 
P [Keiser, Kam]  	price	 
X [Keiser, Kam]  	Exchange 

I should probably be shot for forgetting this stuff, but your help will be appreciated.

Zhiyong

This is an updated sheet of post-id's.  We added many and deleted some also.

Hope this works.

KK
 

Debbie,

Have you had any luck getting the Nov. 30th post id's? I did my best job trying to get them for Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with over 400 post-id's I guarantee that we missed some.

Let me know if you still think it's possible, I would like to get back to Zhiyong today.

Thanks again for your help,

Kam
x3-5781

Oh yeah, he's the one.

Is that his name???

Thank you.

Kevin,

We have over 400 books that were getting officialized at that time.  I tried to get from everyone which post-id's they used that day from Houston, Chicago and Calgary but with that many books we are bound to get a wrong post-id or miss one.  I need to get the list from credit or RAC to be sure we have the right information.  I have yet to hear from them today. 
I also told Z to run with what he had and I'll get with him asap if I find it was wrong.

Thanks
Kam

Raj,

I spoke with Zhiyong and they are going to run the script overnight and give a status in the morning.  

Kam has sent Zhiyong a tentative list and is confirming with RAC that she has all the right post id's.  I have asked Zhiyong to run with the tentative list.

US Global Products and Coal Post ID's have been sent to Zhiyong.  We will send the London Global products post id's first thing in the morning.

EIM book data has been extracted via a fetch macro and we have begun creating the schedule A for those books and hope to have it for cob tomorrow.

Sheila Glover and Clara Carrrington are working on the fx/interest rate books and Sheila will provide an update on progress cob tomorrow.

Kam, Zhiyong, Todd and Sheila,

If any of the above is incorrect, please feel free to correct.

Kevin

Mark,

Attached are a few examples of the broker quotes we get daily for each region.  I believe you had requested some curves so I also have the curves that were published for November 30th ready for you.  The files may be too large to send so please let me know if this is something you did request and I will get it to you.  

Thanks

Kam
x3-5781

    

Yes, we are set.

Thanks

Kam,

Does this give you what you need?  

Phillip
Kam,

Many of the SW curves have become obsolete since losing Enron's obscure deals.  Therefore, we would prefer to reduce our curves to the following:
	
	BASIS				INDEX				GDI-Index			PHYS			

	NGI-SoCal			NGI-SOCAL			GDP-CAL BORDER		NGI-SOCAL
	IF-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ			GDP-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ
					IF-ELPO/PERMIAN		GDP-ELPO/PERM		IF-ELPO/PERMIAN

Mike would like to kill Kingsgate in the NW.

Thanks

We have created six new curve files for UBS.  Could you please look at them and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not responsible for and we will move them.  Also, you can use these files to change or update your links.    O:\_dropbox\West Curves

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?

Thanks

Kam

If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.

Those have been corrected.  They tagg pieces have been moved but demand charges were not deleted.

Zhiyong,

These are the post-id's that we have pulled.  Showna and Debbie Brackett are trying to get the official post-id's from the system.  Once they get that, I will check them against these.  It is very possible that these won't be all of the correct id's but I wanted to get you something to start on.

Thanks

KK

 

Fyi,

ubsenergy.com has been registered.  (so for all you trying to squat and extort money for the name, you're too late).  our company name is, reportedly, UBS Warburg Energy LLC

Albert,

I spot checked a few of these and they are not all official.  Can you please list only the Nov 30th official post-id's?  I can't tell from your post-id sheets if I'm picking the correct ones.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.
PL

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

John,

There is a new book request in Controls\Book Request Form Central Canadian final.xls

Can you attach a code to these and send it off to global and Cecilia?

Thanks

Kam

Do you know what she is talking about.  Do you have to have a seperate book for futures and options for Crude, unleaded and Heating Oil??

KK

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Attached is the updated version of the new product/book assignments that I sent Torrey yesterday.

We are still unsure which books to attach the physical products to.  Let me know if you see any problems.

Thanks
Kam

 

Thanks

You still have access to test - the data is just old - but strangely won't effect you too much.   Doubt it will be refreshed - due to production being the priority.   

Stephanie will set you up in the new production by the end of the day.  Don't get too excited - it all looks the same.  
All the programming effort has been put on the website. 

Temporary link to new production cluster

http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com/   (select - UBSWenergy Cluster)

Thanks,

Will the test database be converted by Thursday?  We will be unable to verify that the deals are bridging correctly unless we can see the EOL reports.

Kam

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).     

Tom,

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

Thanks

Kam

Susan,  

The performance book has been corrected by global counterparties. 

Sorry to bother you.

Can you please change the org regions for the attached books.  

Thanks

Here are the curves loaded for East, Texas, West and Central on November 30th.  They are also saved in O:\_Dropbox\Kam\Nov 30 Curves if you need to make any changes.
I left a copy of all broker quotes from that day on your desk.

All broker quotes are saved in O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Here are a few samples.
      

These are the curves for each region....basis, index, gas daily & physical.

    

Kam -

Can you get a list of all curves together for 11/30.  And any sample broker quotes that we may have.  ( I hope we are saving them at this point.)

Thanks

Fixed.

Can you figure something out for these guys?

Thanks

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Here you go!

How about Canada?

Torrey,

I added two columns to the right showing what the curve is now and what it should be.  We made some changes to the curve names to make them consistent.

Let me know if you need anything from me to make these changes.

Thanks

KK

 

Columns A-E are the exact names and their risk type.  Column G-H will be the mappings for the gas daily mappings.

If you can wait until the morning, I will have a more complete list for you.  We have made a few changes.

I will send it ASAP.

Thanks

Kam

I forgot to attached the excel spreadsheet.

Z,

This is a list of the curves we will be using in Netco.  We may have some additional curves to add to this list but I wanted to get you something to start with.

Thanks

KK
 << File: Netco Curves.xls >> 

The following will be the deal entry procedures for UBSWEnergy:

Financial
1.  All non-electronic financial deals to be entered directly by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 

Physical
1.  All current month physical deals to be booked directly into Sitara by front office (logistics/trading)
2.  All non-electronic prompt month forward deals to be booked directly into TDS by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 
	 - physical meters to be added by logistics/trading

Thanks,

Will the test database be converted by Thursday?  We will be unable to verify that the deals are bridging correctly unless we can see the EOL reports.

Kam

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).     

Tom,

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

Thanks

Kam

Torrey,

Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

is that correct?

I will send the finished product when Hunter is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.
Kam

#992523 is the valid deal.  When the second deal was created, the deand charges should have been deleted.

It has been fixed.

Thanks

Kam, 

I am not sure if Anne Bike is still with Enron, but this email could not be delivered to her. Can you look at the email below and let me know if it is something you can help me with?

Thanks,
Genaro

Anne,

For Nov. 2001, ENA billed Northwest Natural Gas for demand charges on deal # 992523 and deal # 967236. The total amount for each deal was $127,500.00 (300,000 @ $.425). The customer paid for only one of the deals. Do you know if both deals are valid and the customer is responsible for paying both? (Note: the comments on deal # 967236 state - seller's choice, if gas is delivered @ Caly Basin use # 992523.) Please advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

Scott,

I put some question marks next to Brad, John, Pete and Sandra's products.  You have them down as managing some physical products.  Will they be managing those physical books?
If not, they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before. 

Can you take a look at those? 

KK

Torrey,

For those traders that also do deals in canadian dollars, we had to create additional books for those deals.  These will not have any EOL products associated with them, they will be phone trades.

Thanks

KK

Thanks,

I beleive it is Keith and Frank.

yup... i don't know who is saving them daily either.  i'll forward this to keith though, i think he's the major recipient of the quotes.

I don't know who has been saving these daily.  Can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead.  They are for the estate and need to keep them away from the Netco files.

are we saving the files out there everyday?  do the traders do/know this?

The files for the broker quotes have been moved from the Netco file to O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Those will be used for the estate.

Please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today.

Thanks

All of the TAGG deals identified by structuring have been moved to that book and we have been calculating and reporting it as of last Thursday.  The sitara book is still being worked on and should be ready to go today.

Kam

Kam,

Jeff Gossett told me that you are working on the new Estate book for performing deals.  We were wondering when this book would be finalized and when all the deals would be moved over into the new Performance book.  Could you just let me know when you think it will be finished.  Thanks for all your help.

Tiffany

We will get you the FT-Ontario and Intra-Ontario.  Please call Brian Gillis in Canada for the FT-Canada book.  Do you know what the full name for FT-US-Can is, that name doesn't exist in TAGG.

Thanks

Kam,

Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:

Is this change only for those using EnPower?  My group will no longer be running any power books and won't need EnPower any longer. 

If this affects the gas applications in any way let me know, but I think that this won't be necessary for me.

Thanks

Dear Kam,

The Oracle Power database has been moved. The Excel Applications which are involved with the database need to be modified. So does your PCs' setting.

To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.  

Thanks, 
Mike Croucher 

Dawn,

Please leave all risk types to the same books.  We won't be splitting the index out this time.

Thanks

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books "flip" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

FYI....

To keep things consistent all of the traders, except the financial group, will use their physical books to log in for EOL.

Hey,

Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the Mirage. 

You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other vacation can do that.

Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be interesting.

How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?

Later,
Kam

Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Kyle

Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

Errol,

Torrey sent us a file with all of the EOL products and the old book assignments.  He need us to tell him the new trader name, book name and global ID today. 

The file is saved in Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US gas)_EOL new books.xls

the global ID's are saved in your book request also in the controls file

OK, the fun continues.

We need to assign EOL products to traders.  Torrey sent a file (Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books) with all products and the old book assignments.  We need to get with the traders today and get these split out.....many will stay the same as before.  

Also, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately.  ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book.  I have told Dawn that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know.

Thanks

KK

Hal McKinney is trying to clean up this file this week.

Thanks
Kam

Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?

We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Thanks

KK

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

Demand charges and triggers are done.

Kam - I've had the coordinators go through all of the terminated counterparties, and here is another list of deals we are questioning.  Can Risk review the deals that are demand charges/triggers and either verify their validity or zero them out?  I'm meeting with Logistics this afternoon to review the deals that flowed past the termination dates to ensure that they are correct.  This needs to be done today if possible, as we will have to run the accrual on Monday.  Thanks.

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?

Thanks

Kam

If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

As per our phone conversation, I have attached a listing of all the products which are being migrated to EOL NetCo. If Risk could fill in the traders which will be managing each product and the Global Book ID, we will use that data as the basis for an update script to automatically assign the new books to each product. 
 
I'll be in the office early tomorrow if you have any questions, or would like to go over any special book assignments that may need to be covered outside of a mass-update.

It is the Import Gas Daily file under Curve Maint in Runm.  We are working on an excel file with the intra-month and gas daily curves and will send it to you when we are done and we can try to load them once the database is split.

Thanks

kam

Can you specify which gas daily curve mappings.

We can probably load all of them up in excel.
You do your editing.
then we load it back into the database.

I think she is referring to the egs_gas_daily_pub_mp table accessed from runm->Import Gas Dly->Edit Mapping screen,
although I could be wrong - please have someone work with her - thanks.

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

Do you or anyone else in your group get broker quotes on a daily basis to help set the curves?  If so, is there a spreadsheet kept with them that I can get?

Thanks

I have one question about this form.  Does the book id mean the name exactly as it appears in tagg or is it the risktrac name (attaching the risk type to the end), 
ex. FB-FINANCIAL-PRC

Debbie, here's the updated Book Entry template.  Added a few dropdowns and "helpful entry tips".  Thanks.

 << File: bookentrytemplate2.xls >> 

Do you guys know which books each of your people will be doing?  There is a column for that in the trader matrix under the controls folder.  Ramesh will be loading our information into risktrac for us once we have all of the information, book admin id is one of the fields he needs. 

When you have decided can you please input that into the trader matrix and I'll then forward everything to Ramesh.

Thanks

Kam

Susan,

What time can that estate book be ready to go?

Greg,

There are still about 2,000 deals between ECC and Riskmantra that need to be moved to the Bankruptcy books.  IT did all ECC to ENA deals, they need to change the script to ECC and Riskmantra.  We started to move some of the deals manually but there are too many to do.  Sanjeev Gupta has been doing this for us in the past.   I left a message with him but you might want someone to follow up with him to make sure it happens before calcing time today.

Here is a list of the deals if you guys are looking for work to do.

 
Thanks

KK

We have a copy of the p&l format we will all be using saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\blank P&L.xls.  If you are setting up your formulas you can use this format to create all your links for the new NGP&L and then change them to the individual p&l's later, we will be deciding how to break out the traders sometime this week.   

Attached is a list of the book names and the traders associated with each book.

 
Let me know what you guys need to get all of this set up this week.

Thanks

O'neal Winfree currently manages the Texas risk management group for natural gas and is also responsible for the benchmark reporting group.  He works closely with the Desk director and other traders to ensure accurate reporting of the positions and P&L's.  He has eliminated most OA variances on his desk and has helped the other regions as well.  O'neal and his group recently created a new physical P&L reporting tool to assist the risk and trading groups.
  
Scott Palmer is currently the East desk lead and was the central desk lead prior to that.  He set up and managed the Wellhead region and created new reporting tools for the traders to manage their supply.  He was also responsible for calculating and reporting the Virginia Natural Gas asset management book and worked closely with the structuring group and others at VNG and Sequent to resolve any issues or questions.  
 
James Hungerford has been a book administrator on the East region for the past six months.  He quickly became an important part of the team by managing up to three traders' P&L's and making numerous improvements to our daily routines such as streamlining the Weapon-X database, automating the new deal checkout and implementing a daily VaR estimate process.  Prior to risk management, James was the Operational Analysis coordinator for the east region and worked with risk management and other downstream groups to clean-up all past variances and helped eliminate future problems.

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

Kam
 

Will you still need the GD curves, GD-HPL/SHPCH and GD-WAHA, or can the GDP be used instead?

KK

We don't have access to UBS applications today.  They are supposed to make the switch for us tonight.  I have Stephanie a list of risk people that need access to the reports so after tonight we'll be able to test it out. 

Thanks

KK

To prepare for the simulation test that will run this week, can you please make sure the necessary people in your group have the appropriate access to the UBS application to perform their job function.  For example, I know that the Reports application was used by most groups and that the risk groups also used the Bridge Monitor application.

Although we are not expecting any problems to arise, please let me know of any issues your group has logging onto the system.  Thank you for your help!

When you all are done identifying those curves could you please get me a list of the curves by risk type?

Thanks

Kam

Attached are the original spreadsheets with additional book requests in yellow.  This should be the end, or close to it, for the Netco gas book requests.  As before, could I get the global id's once you are finished? 

Thanks,

Sorry,

I forgot to attach the spreadsheet.

 

Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Scott,

Just so I understand correctly,  for the dollars in green, we are to pay Coral this amount as demand charges?

KK

Suzanne,

You may want to coordinate with Kam.  She may already be handling this from a Settlements perspective.

thanks.

Scott, i did forget about you, its like pulling teeth to get something brought in from archieves.  i should receive the info either today or tomorrow, once i get that information, i should have it done quickly.  ill keep you posted.

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

At some point I would recommend setting up a mailbox for your new controls group.  That way we won't have to worry about who is doing what, everyone in the group will get it.  The current controls group did that and it was much easier.

Yes, I can set up the new books if you can provide me the book short names and book codes.  But the book needs to be first set up in Global then I can set it up in Tagg/Erms.  Contact Cheryl Johnson to set up new books in Global.  Once she completed then I can finish the rest.

Cecilia,

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.

Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.

I tried to breakout the curves for Keith and Frank in the file you are working on but we should run that by them for approval.  Mike will be setting all gas daily and physical curves.  I think we can combine basis, index and GDI curves into one file per trader leaving only three curve files to load.
 
Let me know what you think.  Once we get their ok on the curves, we can set them up and let them add any formulas they need, especially Mikes file.

KK

Two people will be setting curves for basis.  Keith Holst for CA curves and Frank Ermis for Rockies and Southwest curves. I will be setting curves for balance of the month.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks
Kam

Can you get together with Zach on Thursday or Friday and walk him through a simple book.  Take Jane Tholt's book and discuss Risk 101.

Bryce,

These deals have been corrected.  The triggers and demand charges have been removed.  Deal #1005851 did have gas flow and I believe should still be settled unless someone says otherwise.

Thanks

Kam

I am reviewing the accrual, and have found a number of deals so far that look like they were terminated, but the demand charges/triggers are still in Sitara.  Should these be zeroed out as well, or are we really supposed to bill them?  I haven't made it through the whole list, but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning.  Please let me know today if possible.  Also, if I've left anyone off that needs to see this, please let me know.  Thanks.

There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

I have highlighted the risk people in grey.  Can you add Jeff Gossett and Matt Olney?
I will send this to Power to check their names.

Mike,

Let me know when you are free, I would like to bring Phillip Love up to meet you.

KK

I have done all of these except the PGL&C deals.  Scott, should these be terminated?

KK

I am reviewing the accrual, and have found a number of deals so far that look like they were terminated, but the demand charges/triggers are still in Sitara.  Should these be zeroed out as well, or are we really supposed to bill them?  I haven't made it through the whole list, but here's what I've seen so far that I'm questioning.  Please let me know today if possible.  Also, if I've left anyone off that needs to see this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Torrey,
 
We have taken over the responsibilities for setting up new books so we will be learning that today.  These books should be ready by Wednesday.  I will know more after we speak with them today.
 
Once they are ready, we will send you the matrix you forwarded me.  I have a question about that, you have a column for TAGG financial and physical.  What is the difference? 
 
Thanks
 
Kam
 

Hi Kam,
 
As per our discussions last week, I have attached a trader/book association table for U.S. Gas. If you could get the desks to fill in the appropriate information for the new books, Tara and I will get the data set up in EOL for product selection and testing.
 
Thanks!

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.

Thanks

KK

Darron,

The curve lists are saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\central\current central/ontario curves.xls

I can help you sort through those if you want help.

KK

No Denver region.  The book was named after the office.  We can change the name and it will be a part of the west.

Mike

Mike,

Will there be a Denver region for Netco?  I have assumed that everything will be considered West but want to make sure before we set up the books.

Thanks

John,

Are you ready to learn your first control function.  The controls group is going to let us set up the new books we need for Netco today.  When you are ready let me know and we'll go down there, or they will come up here or whatever.

Kam

Shona,

I understand we will now the group to set up new books.  Can we get some instructions from someone in your group, Susan I assume.  John Valdes and myself will be the ones to take this over.  Please let me know if Susan is this person and we'll get with her today.

Thanks

Kam

Are any of you still around?  I need to talk to one of you about this request.  

Thanks

FYI

Susan,
attached is a new matrix for each desk.  This should replace the previous matrix you are using.  We are just putting our groups down in the access request list and this should be used to cross reference.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 << File: desk matrix.xls >> 

Susan,

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Thanks

Kam

 << File: Book Request Form  Financial.xls >>  << File: Book Request Form Central.xls >>  << File: Book Request Form East.xls >>  << File: Book Request Form Texas.xls >>  << File: Book Request Form West.xls >> 

The following will be the deal entry procedures for UBSWEnergy:

Financial
1.  All non-electronic financial deals to be entered directly by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 

Physical
1.  All current month physical deals to be booked directly into Sitara by front office (logistics/trading)
2.  All prompt month forward deals to be booked directly into TDS by Risk Management from a written and signed deal ticket (required) from front office 
	 - physical meters to be added by logistics/trading

Shona,

Here is our updated form A without intercompany deals.  Included on the last two tabs are the details they asked for from gas.

We are still working on the contracts and confirms.

Thanks

KK
 

Russ,

Can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations.  We are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all "internal" curves.  We need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes.

We also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well.  Will sitara have a separate database for Netco and estate like TAGG will?

Kam

Can they be done by Tuesday next week?  EOL needs these to get this information soon in order to start their set up process. 

Kam

What time frame are we looking at?

I will call you soon.

No problem.  Just let me know when and where you want to meet.  Thanks for setting this up.  I really appreciate it and look forward to talking with you about what I will be doing.

Thanks,

Zach,

Can you get together Friday morning to go over the basics of what we do?  I will try to find some old class materials for you to review as well.
I will let you know when and where tomorrow.

Thanks,

In order to streamline getting users set up for access to the new environment supporting "Netco" (old EnronOnline applications),
we need to have the names and userids of your staff needing these applications.

In order to minimize processing several requests individually, we will use these lists to eliminate deletion of the names in the current database. This will save us from having to recreate them, which will save time on both sides. 

BUT, we need this information by 11AM tomorrow. Sorry for the late notice but IT has defined the deadline.

Thank you for your assistance.

Do you have a copy of the detailed procedures that Chuck prepared for the morning reports?  I am looking for a copy in excel if you have them.

KK

Let me know if there is anything I help you guys with for the controls reports.  I would like to be involved in this process to understand it better.

Kam

Thanks,

Chris was able to get me a copy of that yesterday.

Susan,

Could I please get a copy of a blank book request from you.

Thanks

Kam

there is a book request form in Netco\controls\Book request form.xls.  I put in the west desk books already.  Susan is checking to see if we can use those portfolio and book codes, if not we'll change them.

KK

Yes,

The first three legs are the purchase for 80,000/d.  Leg 4 is the annuity, and leg 5 is the put.

I don't think I know what you are asking.

KK

See attached Summary Sheet, they all seem to be the same Tagg #'s with different legs.

It looks like legs 1,2,3 are part of the Purchase, while the other legs are part of the Resid Swap.

Thanks Russell

The counterparty short name you gave me doesn't exist in TAGG.  Is this a new name?

Kam
x3-5781

Will anyone be taking Tori's place or are we down to 9 books?

KK

Mike,

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks
Kam

Can you get together with Zach on Thursday or Friday and walk him through a simple book.  Take Jane Tholt's book and discuss Risk 101.

Send him an email with a time and place.

Thanks,
Mike

thank you

kam,

i created a folder within Netco / West called "Summary P&L" and put the sum p&l and the phillip/mike email file in there.  fyi, neither report will work at the moment, as the macros are pointed to the old pnl's.  once the new pnl's are created, it won't be tough to get them running, just let me know.

thanks,

We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.

I started a spreadsheet for us to keep track of our books, traders, file names, etc.

It is saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Controls\Trader Matrix.xls

Please add any other fields you think we should have.  Jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders, O'neil had this idea.
Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today?  Has Scott Neal gotten back to you yet Phillip?

KK

We have decided to name our books FB-West1 thru 10......for each region

We will have a matrix saved for everyone to be able to look at with the book names, trader names, sitara books, P&L file name, global id, and everything else that anyone might want to see.  I think this will make things more consistent than coming up with new stupid names like before.  All books, including the financial books, will have the same portfolio and book codes.  Physical books will be seperate but will all be the same.

KK

  

Biliana,

We are making sure this week that we have all the files we use listed to be moved to Netco.  Can you please make a list of all the paths and files used to prepare the morning reports, including the VaR access database?  I will need this before lunch. 

Thanks

Kam

Z,

We have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with Netco.  Will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them, or will copies be made so both groups could use the files?  If not, we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already.

Thanks

Kam

I brought some of my natural gas and options books from home.  Please come by my desk if you want to read one during the day or make copies of some chapters to take home with you.

KK

  Please take me off your list.  I don't wish to receive any more email from you.

Have you started to set up any new books for NetCo. yet?

Do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier?
Also, I think we should have some consistency in book names (make them more descriptive).  any other suggestions?

If you don't have these already.

Do you need VAR estimates form me?

Can I get a list of the traders that will make up the new reporting list for the new company as we stand today?  We need to get new books set up, and also we need to get the V@R engine ready to go as well.

Thanks

Chance,

We need to prepare the morning reports for the last day of the year.  Biliana isn't here today, could you please take care of that today for her?

Thanks

Kam

Now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high, we need to get back in gear, TODAY.

1.	Everyone needs to be here no later than 8:00am, 7:30 once we start trading again
2.	No playing on the internet or other games (ex. cards) - this will no longer be tolerated
3.	I have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to LEARN.
		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry
		start studying the firms rolls, learn what the macros do, develop new checks and balances
		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from
		understand the curve files (these will change but the general format will be similar)
		
Just to be clear, this is coming down from Jeff Gossett.  
The list for NetCo. is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up, or if someone doesn't.

We are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company.
I know it has been boring but things need to change starting today, things will start to pick up in the next few days.

The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14th.

I would like to get your ideas for changes/improvements to our current processes/systems.  We have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed.
This is our chance to change the things we couldn't before.  There is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before.

Please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have, no matter how small, every little bit helps.

Come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns,

Thanks,
Kam

Please respond to me with your Enron SAP Profit Center numbers.  It will help me in putting the budget together.  Thanks.

Has everyone saved all their necessary files to the netco. directory?  I will be starting this list today.
 
Thanks
 
Kam
 

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?

(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

 

 

 

FYI...

I changed a deal you booked on Friday from IM WC CAL to IM WEST.  That book no longer exists.

Hi!

First, I would like to say thanks for clearing so many variances last month.  It was greatly appreciated!  Here are the variances between the Risk P&L and the GL as of November 30.  Let me know if you have any questions.  FYI - I will be out of the office until December 31.

Thanks,
Amanda

Kam,

I spoke to Ramesh about this. According to him, rac.enron.com will be available in NetCo.

We need to add the RAC website to our list of programs to be moved over with Netco.

the website is rac.enron.com
Let me know when you get this if there is anything we need to do to make sure this happens.

Greg,

Have you had a chance to look at the new forwards details we talked about?

Kam

John,
 
I was just thinking about the December liquidations.  We moved many deals over to a book called Bankruptcy for december forward production months.  We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for Jim's (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our P&L's.
 
How can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not?
 
KK

Errol,

Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from Jeremy or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?

Thanks

Kam
call me if you have any problems

I started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.

Going forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.

See you on Monday.

Kam
  

Scott,
 
I did the last four pages of this.  The pages before that look like they have already been done.  I just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already.  I didn't want to waste time, Bridgette is out until next year so I couldn't ask her what the problem is.  I'll leave the pages on your desk.
 
Kam
 

 

Please note that I am resending Part 6 because I had to remove deal# 309909 and 309408,  they are Enron affiliates.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

<< physicaldeals 120101 SBR partial listing 6.xls >> 

Sorry.......... 

 << File: physicaldeals 120101 SBR partial listing 6.xls >> 

This is missing an attachment I think. 

Jeff, 

Please find part 6 of the ENA deals that still need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.   We have been compiling a list of deals that will need further review by Legal and/or Risk and will have these to you very soon as well.  

Since Stacy Richardson is on vacation, feel free to call me 3-3818.  If not, please call any of the people listed above if you should have any questions or concerns with this data.  

Thanks,

Sanjeev,

Could you run these post-id's also.  This is the last book I will need.

Thanks

KK

Ryan,
 
Everyone else is going to be here on Monday so please feel to stay a few extra days.  We will have the normal closing stuff, (liquidations, PMA's, etc.)  I've already checked out our PMA's and we don't have anything to liquidate so it should be a piece of cake.  Things may pick up a little bit on Wednesday getting the books closed for the year.
See you then
 
Have a great weekend,
 
Kam
 
 

Kam,
 
Hey... hope you had a good Xmas.  I am scheduled to be back to work on the 31st.  If I'm not really needed, let me know.  I'm more than happy to be back, but if it's not necessary, than I would stay in KS a day or two longer.
 
I'M NOT ASKING FOR MORE TIME OFF, I know I've taking a longer vacation than most.  I just want to make sure that my returning on the 31st is still needed.
 
-Ryan

FYI......

We are not bringing in prompt month value tonight.  Texas did, about $25,000.  The other regions don't have what we need for demand charges, etc. and no one has taken any time to research the values yet.  The other groups we need have been gone for hours.  We have some large positions which I don't really think are right.  I'll look closer in the morning.  

Hope you feel better soon, at least you have all weekend to recover.

See you Monday,

Kam

Attached is the new list of Financial Nat. Gas deal terminations by Counterparty.  Please move all Financial Natural Gas transactions for the relevant Counterparties on the attached list to the Bankruptcy Book.  Again, I have included the CP ID's for your reference.  Please let myself and Jeff Gossett know when the move has been completed.  Please call with any questions.

 << File: Financial Terminations 12-19.xls >> 

Jeff,

Here are the post-id's for you (or whoever) for Friday.  Ignore the CAN tab.  You should have access to these books, if not you can use my computer.  kkeiser & tamu96ddd on the right computer.

I may come in for the afternoon.  Let me know if you will need help for anything else, I'll come in.  There hasn't been anything going on except running mini-books for Russell Diamond.

See you later,

Kam

 

Scott,

Can you check the contract on #500282.  The chicago office needed to add a month to this deal and it wouldn't let it due to the contract #.  I changed it but probably shouldn't have.  It probably needs a new ticket.  Let me know.

Kay in Chicago needed this at 312-541-1235

Thanks

Kam

Amanda,

Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are booked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's, it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.

Thanks

Kam

Done.

Genaro, we restructured the deal effective with November deliveries.  I have a copy of the document if you need it.  Phillip Love and Kam Keiser are familiar with the deal if they can help.  The customer is correct in their pricing.

Frank
Frank/Scott,

Are either of you handling deal # 22957 (sell to TBG Cogen)? There is a price discrepancy for Nov. 2001.

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

Scott,

Scott Tackett has taken over Sean's responsibilities.  He can take care of this for you.

Thanks

Kam

Kam,

Per my voice mail, I believe that Sean Riordan is no longer with Enron, so I am not sure who might handle his function.  Just to follow up, I believe that the below deals should change accordingly...

Deal		Current CP			Should Be CP
927642		Coral Energy Canada, Inc.	Coral Energy Resources, L.P.
848014		Coral Energy Resources, L.P.	Coral Canada U.S., Inc.

"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us..."

Does this need to exclude intercompany deals also?

Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards

I started calculating the bankruptcy book last night for the credit group.  This needs to be done nightly.  I may be out a few days so if I am can someone else take this over from me please?  We can also use these to check daily for counterparties that have been moved incorrectly.

All deals have been moved to ENA-IM WEST last night.  Set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-X, make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail.  If it is blank, you can run your weapon-X and input into your P&L this morning, you will also need to officialize your physical book one last time.  

Financial - you don't need to roll your p&l anymore, (except for Monte, you will have to due to the transport model).
Go into the RAC website and inactivate all of your books other than the physical, you will do that tomorrow.

Now that all tagg deals are in one book, we will be splitting up the alphabet among all groups to help monitor that the correct counterparties are being moved to the Bankuptcy book.  We will get with you all later regarding that.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

KK

Oops,  I forgot you.

KK

 

Mark,

This is a copy of the transport model.  We don't breakout the monthly cash flows but the individual tabs hold all the prices and volumes.  You could use that to get the value you need.

Risk groups:

Also, I wanted to let the risk groups know that I met with E&Y yesterday and they noted some items they would like to follow up on.  I've asked them to contact you directly.  Lastly, the form A's prepared were not consistent in regards to the treatment of intercompanies.  E&Y needs the 11/30 form A's without intercompanies.  For those of you who provided Form A's with intercompanies, please break them out and send us a second form.

Thanks

Shona,

Thanks for the Form A update meeting yesterday.  Here is a more formal
request for the follow-up items we mentioned.  If you could help point us
in the right direction to obtain this information, it would be appreciated.

1)We would like to review the results for a sample of queries for the Form
A's (whether these are reports generated or the output resulting from the
below queries).

Commodity:  Natural Gas

Transaction Distribution by MTM (#): >=$0mm, <$1mm
Tenor Distribution by MTM ($): >=3 years, <5 years

Commodity:  Electricity

Tenor Distribution by Transactions (#):  <1 year
Trade Type  Distribution by Transactions (#):  Forward
Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Forward

Commodity:  Eastern Coal

Tenor Distribution by MTM ($):  >=5 year, <10 years

Commodity:  C3

Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Swap

All queries are for both financial net and physical net values.

2)As a second follow-up, we would like a description and sample contract
of each product type (for the largest positive MTM within each category),
as defined by each commodity (this is item 8 on our comprehensive request
list)

3) A confirmation for the longest deal for each commodity (also related to
item 8 in our request list)

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)

I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott

It was just a funny song making fun of Enron.  You didn't miss out on much.
I signed the offer letter last week, and we went through the orientation and filled out the piles of paperwork.  I won't have the new title and company name officially until the 8th I heard.  

What is up with you?  How's the car treating you?  Were you able to sell the maroon thing?
I'm house shopping now, I want to build one, just don't know where.  It is fun looking though.

Talk to you later,

KK

Hey,

Are you officially an employee of the new company ?  If so when are they
going to start flowing gas again?  I tried execute the attached file but was
unable.  What was it?  Anything else going on?

We are still trying to figure out some of the cash traders.  Once we get the word from Lavo we'll let you know. 

Thanks

Kam,

Are there any new developments in the trader world?  We still have the traders and books that you provided last week, but need to know if there are any changes to this.  Please let us know if you need a change so that the deals will bridge with the correct books.

Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

Kam

Hey guys,

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

As seen below,
 
Please start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to Chris.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  
 
Thanks
 
Kam
could you also CC me the first few times you send it?
 
 
 
While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.

Attached are all live financial deals by risk type.  As you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.  

After tomorrow, I will no longer have access to the estate files.  Greg Couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.  

Thanks

Ed,  

Here is a list of the risk people that will be with the estate.  After this weekend, we will no longer have access to the estate files, these people will be able to help you with any of your questions.  We will still be around to assist them if needed.

Thanks

Sanjeev,

I should have a list of post-id's for you by 4:30 today.  After friday, I will no longer have access to the estate, so if you could shoot this off over night so I could have something in the morning to work with I would appreciate it.

Let me know if that doesn't seem possible. 
Thanks

Kam

This was settled with Chris Abel last night. We have always reported our positions in contracts, they want to see it in BCF.  We will be reporting it that way going forward.

Kam
     
fill me in on the issue.  do they just not believe your numbers/

call me 

bob

thanks

break it by location/basis point - and time - at least we will be able to see the make up of the position

Dear Jim & Barry,

We are getting info from gas and power.  We do have an issue with the inception to date P&L (see Chris's memo), and I'm also a bit concerned with the accuracy gas position reported to us of 5500 (short).  We've discussed it with Jeff's group and they have confirmed it, but it still seems a bit big to me.

Well keep working.

Best regards

Is this going to change?  Do we have a new book set up for this?

KK

This is how the logic is now within UBSWenergy.com:

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

Thanks for your help.
Dawn

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks

Please move the following book to book trades with Canada from NG-Price to Bankruptcy:

Ft-Cand-Gone-PR

Could you go back to the detail we used to do the form A, there is also a cross commodity file that needs to be added, and remove all intercompany deals and redo.  Let me check it once you have all of those deals isolated, just to check over the names once again.

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)

I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O 

Thank you.

Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  

Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?

Thanks
Kam

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim

Kim, 

Are these physical or financial, or a combination.  Do you know the termination dates?  If not, I will try to get them from the confirmations group.  

Thanks
Kam

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 

Pls review and let's discuss....

We are paused on this for now.  UBS isn't supposed to get any Enron info and that is what this project was intended to do.  Here is the attachment but don't waste any time until further notice. 

 

Kam - there is no attachment on my Email.  Can you resend with the attachment to Tom McFatridge?  Thanks.

Thanks

Hello Randy & James,

Below are the forwarded instructions as to how we plan to update the excel dsn's for netco(UBSWenergy).  Only test excels in "_converted" folders, then create/move successful tests to a "_tested" folder (within the corresponding "_converted" folder).  

Call me if you have any prob/questions.

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")

Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)

Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 

Should be changed to:
 

Example 4: RMS Example

Original:
   .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=New Rms Production;DBQ=tns:rmsprod_ded;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
Should be changed to:
  .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=rmsp-ora;DBQ=tns:rmsp;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)

There are 650+ excel files to convert so we really appreciate all of the help we can get.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks, (very much!)

Kim, 

I am trying to find the exact termination date for the attached counterparties for physical and financial deals.  Can you help me with this?

Kam

 
Kam,

I was just talking to Barry about this and he is saying that the MTM for future deals should be dated the 2nd as well.  Basically, as of the date the contracts terminated, which most were that day (or monday the 3rd).  Sorry.  Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Kim

Thanks,

I will forward this to Casey Evans to work on the Power side.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).

Sanjeev,  will you be here on Thursday and Friday?  I will need your help again with a dump of data before the weekend. 

Thanks
Enjoy.

Now that we have almost all of the Form A information , E&Y needs form B filled out for all commodities.  We would like to have this as of the deals on 1/31/02.

Please let me know when you will be able prepare the schedule (including a reconciliation to your rolls).

This is what we have to look forward to.  We need to get all post-id's, for the live and bankruptcy books, and get those to Sanjeev Gupta to dump into excel.  Then try to tie those MTM values back to the Gross Book Balance we reported on the final NGP&L.  Once that ties, we will format the info to fit schedule B.

You can't wait, right?

Enjoy.

The estate DPR is ready and will be run on Wednesday and Monday mornings.  Thomas Underwood will be taking over that task from me.

Since you need this as of the 31st, we will have to get Zhiyong the post-id's after we calc. on Thursday and should have this ready to go early next week.

Is that early enough?

List of the final Post ID for the Estate,Bankruptcy and Performing Post ID's for gas and Power.

What exactly do you need for Dec?

Do y'all know when the books will be final for December - I had hopes of being able to utilize the people going to UBS, so if you can give me a status I would appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

 Zhiyong,

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.

The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into?
Is Canada doing their part?

Kam

Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,
Chris

Here is the gas DPR for last night.  You will start getting this on Wednesdays and Mondays.  Please tell me if this is what you need.

Keith,

We are in the process of making new deal tickets for UBS and I would like to get your input.  Could you look at the attached ticket and delete, add or change anything you want to.  Everyone will be using this format for all non-EOL deals, one ticket per trade.

Thanks

Kam
 

Here is our final list of EOL products.

Thanks

Kam

 

Could you please add Derek Baily (dbailey) to the TDS and sitara access list?

Thanks
KK

No problem.

Kam,
I understand that you have a meeting with Debbie regarding portfolios/books et al. Let me see what are the results of that meeting and we can then decide to meet about this.

Regards,
Ramesh

I am on the 5th floor.  05156.  

See you then.

Will do. Please send me your location in ecn.

Thanks,
Ramesh

After speaking with Kim Theriot in confirmations, we will not be using the RiskMantra entity, per the legal department.  All Canada to US deals should be booked ENA to ECC (using the new legal entities of course) rather than RiskMantra.  She is waiting on the final word about our new legal entity names, I will let you know what I hear. 

Thanks

Kam

Dawn,

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to operate this way.  

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the US counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviously considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Brian

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

 << File: ECC counterparties.xls >> 

I am on the 5th floor.  05156.  

See you then.

Will do. Please send me your location in ecn.

Thanks,
Ramesh

Dawn,

Please see the attached trader matrix template.  There were some changes made on the physical global id's.  Steve South was also added on the west desk.

Thanks

KK

 

Good question,

I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?  
  
KK

Only inactivate those books that don't have a trader name next to it on the book request.  There are only a about 6 that should be inactivated.

KK

Will do. Please send me your location in ecn.

Thanks,
Ramesh

How about tomorrow morning at 9:30?  I have a meeting at 10:00 and I'm clear around that.

KK

Kam,
I need to spend about 30 mins with you on the automation process and that you agree with the way we are generating the risktrac book-id. Please let me know a convinient time to meet you.

Regards,
Ramesh 
Ramesh,
     I told her that it is O.K to change the name.

Thanks,
Virendra 

Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.

Thanks

This is a list of RisktRAC book-ids corresponding to what has been created in ERMS. Let me know if the book-id naming is ok with you.

Regards,
Ramesh
  
 
 Book2.xls

That sounds good.

KK

John,Kam,

We can inactivate these books enmasse in risktrac to start with. The position capture jobs will flip them to active if a position comes in on it.
Please just confirm this and we will make it inactive.

Regards,
Ramesh 
FYI - The books are already created in Erms (Netco) and we don't have a field to activate or inactivate books.  Please advise the users not to use the inactive books.

Thanks,
Cecilia

	Attached you will find the new books that have been set up for UBS Energy.  There are some books that do not have a trader name attached.  These books will be inactive until a trader is assigned at a later date.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

	John

Could you tell me what the new Rac website address will be and when it will be ready to use?

Thanks

Kam,
We created the real portfolios of all these books as well. We are waiting on the hierarchy from Risk Controls. If that is delayed, then we will simply dump all the real portfolios under a root portfolio for purposes of testing potential exposure, credit reserve and VaR.

Regards,
Ramesh

Thanks for making those changes.  Let us know when we are ready to start setting up the hierarchy.

Thanks

Kam

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:

FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew

I left a message with confirms....they should answer this for us. 

Brian,

Actually we rolled out the 2 leg logic with ECC to start with, with the intention of rolling out the same logic for you guys.  I worked with Kathy last year on this but we never got the programming worked out with the Tagg bridge.  Believe it or not, it was easier to identify the companies with ECC contracts than develop logic around all the counterparties with master agreements with ENA.  I will bring this up, again, to the Tagg people and see what the time frame is on getting this working for you guys.  I think it will be a while considering they are working with all the estate and database programming.  

Hopefully, we can get that for you soon.

Dawn

 << File: ECC counterparties.xls >> 

Yes ma'am, same as before.

Thanks

Just wanting to verify that we are going to continue the "funky" way of booking gas daily deals (ie 2 legs and 4 legs).  

Please advice before I begin testing the logic.

Dawn

There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.

KK

I created an Inactive Books folder in the Netco file for all currently unused books.   O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Inactive books

They are Texas2, Texas6, East4, East5, Cent4 and Cent5.

Thanks

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
PL
 

Let Russ know also so he can break this up for TDS.  Have him create a roll up for South and Northwest and a total west that sums up both.

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

Meeting to discuss what estate data needs to remain in Netco.

1) Namely price curves, core data
2) What data can we legally bring over to Netco?

Craig Carmichael <cgcarmic@uswest.net> on 05/15/2001 04:38:41 PM
To whom it may concern:

My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State
University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab. 
Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power
traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.

I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron
millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose
success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I
believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am
way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go
somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.

Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be
promising to read the remainder of this email.

   1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.
   2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning
techniques.
   2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the
Chicago area for ComEd.
   3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of
this.
   4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.
   5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy
Associates in Atlanta.
   6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS
future v5.0
   7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training
engine (not yet released)
   8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced
inductive learning methods.

This is the situation:

   I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced
forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural
network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at
ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The
models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using
the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those
that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have
been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary
studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything
that is available at any price.

   Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have
awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that
I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the
Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting). 
This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke
even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they
work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors
appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.

John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he
tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd,
Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project
manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software
for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.

Ok.  Here are the possibilities.

   1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading
forecasting technology
   2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about
   3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock
all by himself
   4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as
well send him a data set to test his claims.

I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I
don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my
technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense
asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of
your in-house modeling efforts.

Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am
making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and
ability to sell you their gem.

What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can
do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not
disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and
companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will
show you flaws in other "gems".

I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a
fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have
a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what
opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in
convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will
go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the
leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or
form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.

Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic
for sending you this lengthy email.

You must have the wrong Jeff King.  I'm in east power trading.  Sorry!

Hi Jeff.

Long time no talk.  I talked to Rou Chandler this week, and we may be getting a group together to play tomorrow evening.  Would love for you to join us.  Call me if you would like to come!

Julie

Hey buddy,

I'm closing on my new house that week so that may be tough.  There is a chance that i could get away on Saturday morning so let me know your schedule.  Hope the family is well.

I am tentatively planning a trip to Houston for the weekend of Nov 16th.
Seeing just a few accounts while I'm there and I am hoping to get a round of
golf in for that Saturday.  I am hoping you can take the time to allow me to
kick your ass on the links.  What do you say?  I will let you know when my
plans are finalized.

that thing looked like a caribou

Jeff Duncan of Sanger, Texas shot the deer they call "Big Boy" at Hagerman
National Wildlife Refuge in Grayson County with a bow on Sunday afternoon.
His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230
6/8.
He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be
10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several
times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but
the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived.
Congratulations
to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.

Louise,

Are you working on this?

     Tammie-
     
     Can you kindly confirm details of where, when, # of sessions if 
     greater than one, for this presentation.  I understand you are the 
     person Louise had designated to help us coordinate the 
     presentation/training.  It will be a powerpoint presentation that we 
     need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the 
     traders/business have adequate number of copies of hand out material.
     
     Attached is the presentation.  Hand outs that we require your 
     assistance in handling is:
     
     - Presentation print out
     
     - Mercy Gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone 
     and cell phones by end of day today
     
     - Wendy Bannerman Clarke to supply the Day 1 Policy (even if still a 
     draft) as well as the Discipline and Sanction policy by end of day 
     today.  
     
     Tammie - If you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be 
     great but it is not required.
     
     Please speak with Debbie Brackett if you have any questions, issues, 
     etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance.
     
     Looking forward to meeting you,

I really think Jeff is a bad choice - let's discuss.

Several people are working independently to create a list of talking points and frequently asked questions relating to our new company, UBSW Energy.  Please forward drafts to Jeff Hodge who will compile, edit and coordinate with the EOL group and UBS legal.  

Louise,

There is no way that Vitro will close this quarter.  Give me a call and I will fill in all the facts.

Read some of Richard's questions

We still haven't got this finalized - I'm  looking to do this this week otherwise I would have to start agreeing with Bill that we have to pull them.

Is Smurfitt the deal you lost last Friday?

No problem - good luck

Hi Louise - just wanted to say thank you so much for your help getting me set up in my new role.   Definitely looking forward to Canada , it will be a refreshing change, though no doubt I will miss EOL and London.    Planning on telling the broader EOL team on Friday. Angela Connelly will most likely be taking over the Marketing here though this is still be confirmed (likely later today). 

Thanks again,
Paul
Hi Paul - my apologies for not getting in touch earlier to let you know the latest.  Yes, all the details were finalized earlier this week, I've accepted the offer and happy to say I'm definitely coming to Toronto.   I will be starting Monday, October 29.     I will give you a call later today if that suits as well. 

Thanks and really looking forward to working with you,
Paul

Paul, I have not heard from you in a while.  My understanding is that you had a couple of discussions with our HR people about transfers, salary etc....

Please give me a call or E-mail as to what your current thinking is...

Cheers, Paul D

The transaction for the sale of the New Albany Peaker Plant just closed.  Paul Garcia of Enron treasury confirmed that we received the wire transfer of the purchase proceeds from Duke. 

I would like to personally thank everyone that was involved in the sales process.  This transaction went very smoothly and I received several compliments from our counterparty regarding our professionalism on this deal.

Please take all post-closing actions that are required to finally consummate the conveyance and also be aware that the Purchase and Sale Agreement requires us to keep any and all data or information regarding the project and the transaction confidential for a period of two years.  In order to comply with the foregoing provision, I would strongly suggest that conversations regarding this transaction be limited to only those Enron employees who have a "need to know."

Thanks

I will - thanks

No, you are not wrong........ I was just offering to give you a more detailed account from an IT perspective, if you require it....

Why not just keep the offer in mind then, in case you need an IT explanation later?

Steve

I was sort of assuming Sally would bring this with her to the meeting. Am I wrong?

Louise,

I'd like to re-issue the offer of giving you background on the project view of the budget, if you require it. ??

regards

Steve
Louise,

I understand that you will shortly receive a first draft budget submission for ENA. I'm not sure what format you'll receive it in, but if its the standard format, it'll be difficult to pick out the project level estimates.

I have access to the team/project level estimates, and would be happy to pull together a quick view that suits you.

I was going to try to guess how you would like to see it, but I thought I'd better ask you first, ....it'll probably save me a lot of work! :) The thought was to give you a quick handle on whats "essential-keep the business running" stuff, and what would be great but we can struggle on without.

Please remember this is supposed to be a quick heads-up, and not intended to replace any full explanation that will innevitably follow later.

Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.  You should also have had a voicemail from John.

See you when you get back.

Let's also talk about your contract when you're back.

Louise,

I appreciate your candid feedback.  

My frustration was the unproductiveness of the events of Friday and Monday.  If we could harness all the energy being utilized internally and redirect it to new business in our external markets, I believe we would have an unprecedented market advantage.   I do understand some amount of politics is "a necessary evil".  

Give me a call in Chicago if we should discuss this further.  I do not want this ordeal to reflect badly on myself or anyone else involved.  I can be reached at 312/541-1225.  I depart around noon in my return to Houston.

Laura

We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.

By the way - give me a date and I'll be in Chicago.

Was originally passed to me from you.

Is a time-waster and is threatening to call you again.

See me if you want details.

Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much.

Louise, further to our meeting last week, the contracts have been executed and the Rockies transportation has been sold to CMS. Origination and trading participated in the P&L.  Orig = $ 1,045,000.  Trading approx $310,000. 

We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.  

Please call if there are any questions. 

BT   

What would be the cost of moving etc - all the new infrastructure etc.  When you say cheaper what do you mean - all in including moving etc.

We obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move.

I had a brief discussion with Marcus Buergler on Tuesday regarding the Portland space.  I indicated to him that our desire would be to move, but that we would need the current space for a short period until other arraingements can be made.  In the last two days we have done some research and think that we can get a better space for less money.  On top of that, there are roughly $600k worth of improvements (separating from PGE) that need to be made here that may not be required in a new sapce.

Based on my very brief discussion with Marcus on Tuesday, I was not aware that we wre heading down a path that would force us to stay in this building.  I learned today that the Estate has accepted the PGE lease for this space and that we have to stay here.  This is very depressing if it is true.

From a money point of view I don't think that it is the best decsion.  More importantly, from a morale point of view this place is horrible.  We have 15,000 square feet when we need between 5,000 and 10,000.  It is absolutely depressing here.  People are very much in favor of moving.

Please advise.

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,

											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

These are the events that took place concerning the New York Customer Holiday Event:

In order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in NY at the Four Seasons, I have to book no later than 9 months out.
To hold these rooms, a contract had to be signed and a $15,000 deposit sent.  The contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of July with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable.
In speaking with Dave Duran and Frank Vickers in May, they wanted to proceed with this event. ( Attached is a memo that I sent to Frank Vickers outlining the cancellation policy.)
The cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in July.
After the approval form was rejected, I spoke with Dave Duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re-submit the approval form.
I talked to both Frank and Dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until I received an e-mail on September 20th from Frank canceling his portion of the trip.
I called my Four Seasons national sales rep and she is working with NY in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages.  I should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail.
Thanks.

As I never approved this, I just wondered if the rumours were true that we did spend money on this trip.

Let me know

Thanks

Louise

We are assuming we will be physical on Monday Feb 11 in Canada.
Let me know if there is an issue.

Thanks

Louise -- Here's a draft of the answer for this guy (David Zaccour).  I didn't get to spend a lot of time on it.  This should give him some good stuff to combine with his own research.  If you think we need to give him more, please let me know.

Liz,

	I work for Anthony Dayao as part of the EES IT group but formerly was in Enron Net Works under Steve Stock and met Louise briefly in 1999.  I'm in the middle of the Rice University Executive MBA program and for one of our final exam questions, we are permitted to consult internal resources.  The question is regarding how we (Enron)  have used the Internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations (Competitors) in the industry.  During our Rice MBA classes, EOL was brought up several times so it's considered very highly by the school.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention its strengths during our exam.

	My professor has provided me assurance in writing (Email) that any answer will not be published.

	I appreciate Louise' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper.

	Regards,
	David Zaccour

Exam Question:

2.	Working with whomever you deem is appropriate in your organization, identify the three organizations in your industry, which in your opinion, use the Internet and World Wide Web the best.

If your organization is not one of the top three, what does it need to do on the Internet and World Wide Web to move to the "best" category? If your organization is among the top three organizations in your industry, what uses of the Internet and World Wide Web have differentiated your organization from other organizations in your industry?

A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    

Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  

1) Access new markets and customers
In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  

2) Manage high volume of products and transactions
Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.

To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.
 
3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line

EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. 

Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  

Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

Gal actually

She's a Cindy type person who has been responsible for organising this conference for years.

Who is this guy.

I heard about the videos at your offsite and I'm hoping people will take your lead.  VHS shot on someone's Sony will be great!  Innovision has also agreed to work with any team to simply provide editing services for them.

As for the $10,000 figure ... I was concerned that if "outsourcing" wasn't an option, we wouldn't get many entries.  But the cheaper the better -- there will be recognition given to the best "independently produced" video.

Thanks for your input and I hope Enron Americas will have a submission.
Terrie
You should give zero budget for videos, not 10,000.  We did this for our offsite and it worked fine.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

As I never approved this, I just wondered if the rumours were true that we did spend money on this trip.

Let me know

Thanks

Louise

Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?

Louise

Both of these below trades are trades that Credit should have approved.  

However, our exposure with IP is over $21mm and we don't have a signed ISDA contract.  I think the analyst (Darren Vanek) was trying to get the attention of Craig Breslau to make it a priority to get the document finalized.  This is an ongoing discussion with Craig and we are seeing little progress.  I can't believe this would have an impact on our relationship with the customer.

The USX trade should have been approved but Darren was probably swayed by our position on an EIM prepay transaction with US Steel where we are requiring the risk to be pre-syndicated.

Darren is a young aggressive analyst which I believe is doing a good job trying to support Fred's team but with more experience will learn where to be more flexible.  

Fred's team likes to push the envelope on Credit. In isolation we will probably be okay but in the context of the growing portfolio of deals it will be increasingly harder to manage our risks.

I think this issue has already been resolved.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.
Bill

All of a sudden (and without prompting - before you ask) I am hearing a lot of noise surrounding Jay Williams and Darren Vanek (?) including a couple of transactions (small but big customers - like International Paper) where the customer is getting very upset as we have refused to do one month deals with them.  Also USX felt the same and we are persuing deals with them too.  Can you look into this for me?  It may be OK but it might be a little over zealous.

Noise from East Gas and Lagrasta's groups

The view is that the CapEx  hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.  Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).
Please find attached the following information: 
(i) Attendees and Teams for Video 
(ii) Draft Agenda 
Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) 
We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek.

Did we retain all the historical data from EOL.  We met some folks that can help us analyse it.

Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though.
 
 

Greg/Louise: Our best middle marketer, Howard Sangwine ($5MM orig - 2001) is considering leaving to Reliant. If we were to offer him a contract with $25/25, I believe he would stay. This guy is critical to our start-up plans (ie getting contracts signed) as he has relationships with the entire Cdn E&P sector. Pls advise

I'm fine but ask Louise and Greg.  I'm just a gas trader. 

Lavo, we may lose sangwine to Reliant (promo to director, $50K sign-on). I think we could keep him if we gave him a contract with $25/$25. pls advise

3 & 4 are better than where we are now.  The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.
 
The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building.

Hello Pat, Louise, Dave

The UBSW real estate department is reviewing the current/future lease

terms for UBSW Energy LLC, in Houston.  According to Brian Dugan, our

lead real estate guy on the bank side, the building owner has offered

a nine month lease to stay in the South Tower on the 5th and 6th

floors.  After the nine months we will be offered the option to sign

up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3

and 4.  Is this a significant issue?  I understand that the 3rd and

4th floor foot prints are similar to 5/6.

If UBSW Energy is willing to relocate to the North Tower, they can

get a lease for 5-9 years but this tower may be less suitable.  What

are the issues here?

The integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with

the Bank's outside legal firm we use for real estate issues.  We have

a target date of this Friday to try to resolve all real estate issues

in order to meet the DAY 0 legal integration date of 2/6/02.

Your thoughts please.

Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).
 
Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).
 
Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.
 
Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day.

Is it okay if I get Jesse(our clerk) to pack your files?  I want to confirm what you wanted packed.  All files except your EOL files.  Does this mean all binders in bookcases as well in your cabinets?

Is it okay to tell people that are calling for you that you are in London?  I told Pat O'Donnell you were in London but reachable.

Also,  do you want someone to sit in for me while I'm out?  I talked to Liz and she thought she would be fine but I wanted to check with you.

As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.
 
Thanks

Steffes is looking for some direction on getting FERC license and pool agreements.  Among other things, he needs the go ahead from UBS and legal to start an application process for UBS while he is still employed by Enron.  When you have a moment, I might suggest a meeting with key legal, reg and commercial people so we know what we can do and when.  This is also relevant to transmission agreements and ultimately to customer agreements.

Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters.

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Hello
 
I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.  
I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.
 
Thanks

Louise: 

We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.

I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.
 
Will your people mopve to Houston?

Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy. 

Tammie will co-ordinate dial ins etc

Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.  As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.

Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.

Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York.

Louise, I talked in detail with Caroline this am. We need to identify where Caroline is going to reside. I understand that UBS has two operations in NY - I think you and Hutchins need to decide what makes the most sense (ie synergies). It is critical that we get this resolved so that Caroline has some infrastructure around her.

2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

  If you would like us to manage this domain, we need to change which servers are considered authoritative for the domain. You will need to log-in to the register.com site to do this. I can either join you to walk you through it or I can send you step by step instructions. Just let me know which you prefer.

Thanks,

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business
for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

  NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001--
  

  Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
  Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers
  

  Though Hewlett-Packard lost $75 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly
Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the
No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business.

  The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of
FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00
p.m. on October 1.  

  In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that
actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in
revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds
the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort
and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and,
last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list)
to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine
startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has
breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in
the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern,
Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in
April.  

  In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward.
In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is
a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior
writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies
the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building
influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider
knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."  

  Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural
list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year)
run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall
Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but
Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are
the subject of great scrutiny," she says.  

  As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year,
power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was
fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who
pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen
Hancock, who failed at her startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker,
who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior
looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never
overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target
profits every single quarter.  

  Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO,
Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO,
Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne
Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena
Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman,
EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper
Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie
Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black,
President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail
Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems,
Raytheon.  

  While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to
evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and
importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her
company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely
to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture
and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one
trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than
ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost
automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE
50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20
billion or more, which is a first.  

  In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at
Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women
want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most
successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she
has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it
advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has
done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving
her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins.

  In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women
in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino,
CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma,
Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia
(Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong);
Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit
(Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina
Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President &
CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at

Jim please confirm to Vince you are happy.
Louise,

Jim Fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to NETCO takes place. He is my current boss.

I am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here. All I need 
is a formal letter or an E-mail. Another alternative is to extend 
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion.

Vince

vince pls call me on this ....we need to facilitate any transfer before you leave

There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.

Mark please help resolve.

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving 
for good, in a week. We have to accelerate the process.

Vince

Does the state have copies of all programs?  Should systems manage the migration?  Muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen?

What is the name of the website where all of this information resides?

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  

As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.

This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

I need help - my home pc is down and unless I sleep in the office its not good.

No quite what I was looking for - I want to know the margin amounts (in /out and the imbalance

 << File: excluded prepays run on nov 22.xls >> 

Louise,

Here's what we've got. This list of MTM values is based on a list of prepay deals #'s from Greg Whiting and shows value as of COB 22 Nov 01.

Global Finance has the rest of the details we need to complete the picture. 

Give me a call if you need more.

Debbie

No support for Mexico.  

Louise

Can you talk with Jaime and figure out a plan of support for Mexico (if we still need one)? You might also want to check with John and/or Louise.

Thanks Rick,  and let's talk after the holidays about a new game plan...Best regards and happy thanksgiving. 

Jaime Williams. 

FYI

Rick

Thanks for your encouraging words during the last few days. I have to say that despite all the difficulties we have had to endure over the past few months, Enron remains the best place I have ever worked.This is due, in no small part, to the great people I share this place with. 

I also owe you an overdue e-mail on the Mexico matter. As I had indicated, I have decided not to take the offer. I have spoken to a number of friends and associates who live in Monterrey and their views are pretty unanimous: Monterrey is a great place to live if one is already settled with a family, but it is altogther different and more difficult for a  single man. Therefore, despite the professional opportunity to work with a great team, I have decided not accept the offer. 

Many thanks for keeping me  in mind, being patient, and moving things along. I will be in touch in the next couple of days. Enjoy your holiday. 

Best regards, 
Paul

 

I want to include all variation margin on this report too..  Please resend today's and include going forward.

Thanks

Sorry I won't be

Louise -

Any chance you're available on the 3rd?  I recognize you're heavily tied into credit issues right now, but a quick "intro" meeting might help convince them that we're still in the origination business.

Thanks,

Mitch

Mitch,

As we discussed last evening, Mike Barnowski, President & CEO,  Alstom,
Inc. (North America), will be in Houston Dec 3 and Dec 4 to introduce
himself
to several Houston based executives.  Mike replaces Fritz Gautschi, who
retired in September.

Mike would now be available to meet with yourself and Louise Kitchen and
others as you recommend:
Windows:
Monday, Dec 3 -  2:00 p.m. or later  (Dinner is still open as well)
Tuesday, Dec 4 -  8:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m.

Please let me know as soon as you can - as you can appreciate I have to
fill in the above windows very soon.

Thanks,

Larry

1. Poor guy - how is he?

2. Inappropriate.

3. No intercompany moves at the moment.

4. No interest.

5. See Jeanie Slone - she has it.

6. Get cash in.

Thanks

Louise

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

5)	Per our conversation last week, I have not received any package at my home.

5)	Is there anything productive I can do to help you?

Laura

Prepays - although they do not terminate they do drop to zero collateral on a further downgrade.

2. Cancel

Thanks

PRC is something we should do all in one day.

I'll let you know. Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps.

1.  Not good.  His mom was only 61 and they had just moved to a resort community outside San Antonio.  His father is very bad.  Russell broke up talking to me about him.

2.  Inappropriate to cancel or proceed?

3.  O.K.

4. O.K., I have to ensure we do not make a unilateral decision that effects Peoples choices.

5.  O.K.

6.  Hear you.  

7.  O.K., new item.  Am I to be doing any type of ranking/review/PRC/appraisal/etc. of my employees?  Seem to have time on my hands and desperately need to remain focused and productive.

And... please let me know if I can help you...  Louise the person.

What is the number?

I am very worried that you are sending a negative message on Enron out of the building.

I have your EOL budget numbers.  Also, we really need to talk about this credit idea soon.  FSA and VMAC are anxious to do a deal, and I really think it can work.

Brad,

I had a conversation with Wally Turbeville from VMAC at around 11 AM. From his conversations with the main players in the industry he got feedback that "they are very enthousiastic about negotiating a deal that would free cash for Enron" (his words). He offered his support to negotiate with the industry players and wants to set up a meeting sometimes this week.

It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.

I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us

On mahonia margining, I spoke with mike garberding. Tells me he went through all collateral issues on these deals with wendi lebrocq in credit last week and everything tied exactly. He will walk tanya rohauer through the exact same steps tomorrow. Eric boyt is pulling deal numbers and details to match to documents.

Ray

Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.

Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.

The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.

Thanks

:Louise
Ray,

Eddie Meche (CRO) and Jim Bob Perkins (President) from Reliant will be meeting with you and I in your offices at 8:00AM.   The purpose of the meeting is to continue to educate Reliant on our current financial position.  They have been supportive in the market until last week where they came out with a public announcement with concerns about Enron.  Our hope is to give them further disclosure to get them comfortable with our near term and long term financial plans.  They have $100mm gross exposure ($50mm net exposure) to Enron and have recently slowed trading volumes.

Feel free to give me a call if you need further breifings.  I will be in the office about 7:00AM.

Thanks,
Bill

Let's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.

Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.

Louise

Non payments for ENA only.  More to follow.  We should seriously consider some default notices.

Bill

Bill - call with any questions.  I will update you tomorrow as we continue to contact the non-pays.  Leslie

Hello Louise,

I know you must be going nuts with all the events, so I have not called.

Hope you will be sorted. Call me if you have time.

Please update daily

Hi Tammie,

Nice to speak with you this afternoon.

As I mentioned, currently Sloane Apartments do not have a two
bedroom apartment available from January 1 - 5, however they feel
that it is likely that a cancellation may come in which would allow
them to accommodate Ms Nettleton.

In the meantime, they shall be pleased to reserve a one bedroom
suite plus an adjoining deluxe double bedroom at their sister
property Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge.  The rate per night of
Slaone Apartments 2 bedroom apartment is GBP195 per night, and
although the rates at Parkes Hotel is considerably higher, they will
be pleased to reserve both the suite and double bedroom for the
same rate.

Parkes Hotel is located at 41 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3.
Below is a brief description plus I have attached a few pictures.
Could you please confirm that Ms Nettleton would be happy to
accept the suite and deluxe double bedroom at Parkes Hotel and
should a two bedroom apartment become available at Sloane
Apartments they will amend her reservation.

The One Bedroom Suite Parkes Hotel has:-

Comprisesof separate bedroom with double bed. Separate
    lounge with Sofa (sofabed on request at additional cost),
    armchairs, coffee table, desk with data port and extensive
    personal bar. Has a full bathroom with shower. Also has small
    kitchen with fridge/freezer and combination oven, together with
    tea making facilities
Can combine with either Deluxe Double or Junior suite
Approximatedimensions 46sq.m

Parkes Hotel has the ideal location. Only 100 metres from Harrods
and within walking distance of many of London's exclusive shops
and restaurants. Heathrow is a mere 30 - 40 minutes away. Let us
arrange a limousine and enjoy the trip in comfort.=0F

Allow us to take care of you. Our staff will be happy to arrange
theatre seats, book flights, do your shopping, run errands, anything
to make your life easier. With no more than fifty guests, we have
the time to make you feel at home.=0F

holiday, we have the facilities and, more important, the desire to
make your stay a pleasant one.

Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution.

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Enron Management Committee	

I hereby resign from the above mentioned committee.

Did Montovano clarify things for you? Also, Roy Boston may give you a call. I know you may be skeptical( at best) of me at the moment, but I care as much as anyone about salvaging this company and its enormous talent and I also "get it" in terms of what's necessary to get there( the perception last week  that I was trying to hang on to an organization and organization structure that was obsolete is just dead wrong....I was trying to salvage as much of an organization that I and others are convinced has always produced bottom line value far in excess of its cost( unfortunately, I failed on this point with two of the most important people at Enron, you and John...and I'm talking before this "crisis" set in)...I do recognize the need for the cuts we're about to make. Hopefully, in time, I can regain the confidence of you and John. Thanks.

Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.  

As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  

UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  

Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.

This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:

1.	Transitional Steering Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.
Committee Members:
Mike Hutchins (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Louise Kitchen
Pat O'Donnell
Mike Bolin
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only.
Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST

2.	Integration Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  

Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members:

UBS counterparties
Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002.
Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate.
Time - Thursday 9:00am CST

3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee:
This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.

Proposed Committee Members:
Louise Kitchen (co-chair)
Greg Whalley (co-chair)
Tim Belden
Chris Calger
John Lavorato
Kevin Presto
Hunter Shively
Rob Milnthorp
Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required.
?Proposed Logistics:
This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.

Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.

3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee 
This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.

I'm out of the cash loop - you need to talk to Bowen

As you know, it is crucial to again put funds back into Enron Re.  Under Bermuda Law, officers, directors, etc, are criminally liable for breaches.  Thanks for getting this done.

Jeff

You need to talk to Bowen.

When payments stopped I moved out of the loop

As discussed with Jeff, this is a payment that we would like to make today (the $1.5) so that we may receive the $2.3 in next week.
Please advise.

we have 71,754.05 bbls of mtbe due us from arco products on exchange(we have already paid  Dugas for these bbls) on the uswc for delivery TODAY to exxonmoblle at usgc +7.0 cpg(estimated value of ($2,320,525.90).  arco products will not deliver to us until we pay them for 47,500 bbls at .79 cents($1,576,050) on a book transfer on 23 nov.  we have received their invoice and it has been processed.  WE NEED TO WIRE TRANSFER TODAY TO PROTECT THIS POSITIVE SALE.
please advise.
thanks, 

Here it is.

Kal
http://www.enronoffline.com/default1.asp?randomid=1256

Please look for them and discuss with Nikki

The tickets will have expired but you should be able to get a refund on the return portion them.  Here's what Ayscough have said:-

Having spoken to Continental in London, they say that Houston may not
entertain a refund or reissue, but London would certainly action a refund
only back to the original card. If they need assistance get them to forward
documents direct to us.

Best regards

There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.

Mark please help resolve.

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving 
for good, in a week. We have to accelerate the process.

Vince

Does the state have copies of all programs?  Should systems manage the migration?  Muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1684000/1684503.stm

We are doing Ok with 3 banks - we may still be in business.

So we should all still have jobs.

Hi Louise,

Just wanted to say thanks to you and Lavo leading the
show these last few weeks.

Thanks from everyone in my team for all the efforts to
keep Enron Going.

Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.

Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders.

Don't know if this will still reach you - over here Enron staff have all
been denied access to terminals.  Will try and phone.

Worried about you both - will the Standard Power offer mean you might still
be ok?  What has the collapse meant for you both?  Is there anything I can
do to help?

You need to stay - I am trying to get us sold.

Louise,
I heard a rumor (from an unnamed source) that you are the reason that I still have a job.  I'm not sure if this will last only an extra day or something longer but I wanted thank you, I appreciate it.

Dan

The same here now

Just wanted to let you know that the administrators asked me to come back in this week so I'm still here ..... it's a bit like Colditz actually.   Best of luck today.  J.

Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.

Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.

I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.

If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.

Take care & I will keep in touch.

Louise

Dear Louise . . .

I am so very, very sad for Enron.  It must be quite heart-breaking for
you--you made such an amazing contribution to the company!!  I am sure
there are many who must still be scratching their heads and trying to
figure out just what happened.  I don't know what your short-term plans
are, but I wanted to let you know that I'm very keen to stay in touch.
You are an extraordinary woman and I'm hoping that our paths will cross
again at some point.  Perhaps you would be good enough to keep me
informed of your e-mail address, should it change, and of your plans.

All the best in whatever comes next.

Gary.

Have them delivered to Jim Derrick and explain that they are Fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office.
I don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now.

We are doing commercial this morning, have we got the other numbers.

Who can I work with to get the first names of the individuals listed for Gas Trading, as well as the split between structuring/fundamentals/trading? (I see some of the latter in the name column, is that the entire group? it would be helpful to have them grouped separately.) In a lot of cases there are several listing for some names, and they appear to be IT people. We're building a plan based on title, so that's why I need this info. Thanks!

here is the updated spreadsheet (password 5555).... we miscounted slightly the total is 131 not 126. 
 
Geoff Storey asked me to make sure Larissa Sharma was included in the group as well.

I just called Colin at home and although he was still half asleep, he seemed up for it.
 
He'll call me a little later this morning once with a final decision, and in the meantime I'll get the HR machine rolling.
 
Steve
 
 
We need to also add Colin Tonks to the list in Jeff's groups.

Louise / Greg,
 
here is the updated spreadsheet (password 5555).... we miscounted slightly the total is 131 not 126. 
 
Geoff Storey asked me to make sure Larissa Sharma was included in the group as well.
 
The area colum hasn't been altered to reflect the 'new' role yet...... we've had to stop for a moment to find over 700 telephone numbers.... :(
 
regards
 
Steve
 
 
 
 
 

Over to you Hunter
Louise,
 
Colin came in this morning, spent some time with the Gas team, HR and then with me, and has decided he doesn't want to come back.
 
He intends to go back to UK in Q2 and intends to chill out untill then, do some travelling etc....
 
We had a long conversation about this, and it was evident that his mind is pretty much made up.
 
He was very flattered about being asked to stay on and he wanted me to pass thanks to you for thinking of him, and is sorry to have to let you down by not accepting....
 
regards

Get all the assistants to do it by the week-end

Tammie,
Many of the desks on 5 & 6 have items in/on them that need to be boxed up and labeled and put in storage. We need to have them cleaned up prior to moving new people to these locations ASAP.

Can you please help identify a task force?

Thanks,

Please get those two people back.

Charles Yeung and Susan Lindberg were not on your list yesterday and so they were let go.  Call me.

I don't understand whta she is offering

Hi Louise,

Just got off the phone with Gail. She wants to know if they can help by coming up with a guaranteed offering from IBM that would help any NewCo succeed by providing IT support/direction, saving money, monetizing assets, retaining key staff and lending the IBM name, etc, etc to the deal.

If you're interested you can either call me or call her directly.

Regards

Mark Pickering 
Chief Technology Officer

Enron Net Works, LLC

  _____  

Anything here?  I think that at one time prior to filing IBM was looking to buy or monetize or loan against all out hardware so we could get cash but I am not sure where that went.

GP

Anthony, Greg, Sally - 

Gail Whipple from IBM called to offer any assistance that they can provide. 

Potential to save money, monetize assets, provide people, provide assistance to employees & people that we don't / may not need, etc.

If we would like IBM to assist, we need to call her @ 914-642-6399.

Thanks - Dan

Ok - I think all the wrtie ups etc are fine - the only one would be EOL that is an issue.  But not the end of the world.

Louise, I took care of this

Is that all of our originators or just heads?

The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Great thanks

Let me know if you see any problems with it.

4 days is long enough.
I'll wait to hear from Carol but I believe we are ok.
It was sold - not sure on closing - you need to email rob milnthorp

Some things to be ready for:
Please forward to john if appropriate.

1. Buyer will likely require netco to use their form of isda and related contracts.  We won't know winner and form of contract until monday.  Earliest we could trade would be next friday.  Is 4 or 5 days enpugh to make platform changes for EoL and related systems?

2 I just learned that under the DIP documents that became effective last monday we cannot execute any new trades except in connection with liquidating old book.  St.clair is running this down for your benefit and clarification.

3.  Alberta ppa was sold?  When is closing?  Depending on canada bankruptcy ruling in next day, we may be able to access these funds to help support newco ops.  Needs furtther investigation.

We do need a list tomorrow morning.  I am still in meetings.  Is is possible to email me questions.

Amy Fitzpatrick sent me a list and asked me to estimate bonus numbers for EOL employees destined for Netco.  I'd like to talk to you before I work on this.

Come and see me tomorrow.

Louise, 
Enron Property has asked me to validate whether some of the remote office leases should be paid for January.  I have been unable to get an answer about the Denver office.  Will you please advise?

We will still be able to reject the lease even if we pay the January rent, if we do so by Feb. 2 under the bankruptcy rules.

Thank you, 
Tammy

Seems like a logical request.  Tell me 90 days is not serious??

Hi all,

I just got off the phone with the Benefits Center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "termination packages" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check, specifically talking about the Cash Balance Plan money.  This all happens AFTER they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the 1st....come on, what is up with this???  It could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands?  That is not right.  Since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees, I'm hoping that someone will take this up with Human Resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process.

Thanks.

All is officially crap here - I have worked 10 weeks straight no week-ends, all night and still its horrible.  Hope its better for you over there.

We have buyers - it's just gettting more and more horrible to be in the building - well actually in Houston come to that.

Hello Mrs woman of many words,

Enron Europe is in administration but the administrators have a huge talent for destroying value very quickly.

What happened?

?

Anne and David,
   Apparently some or all of my TAC group are on the "lay off" list, effective today.  We are working on a project that will require their presence until at least next week, longer for some.  
  For now, please ensure the following 9 individuals are on the RETAIN notice until further notice:
1)  Chris Clark
2)  Angie Wingo
3)  Jason Loup
4)  Junichi Sugiura
5)  Brian Mihura
6)  Richard Boehm
7)  Dan Orbeck
8)  Don Chancey
9)  Ken Kooser 

Thanks,

Life is pretty difficult at the moment.  It astonishes me that we (a trading company) were brought down by a rogue finance shop and some bad investments.

We are trying to sell the trading company (North America) in which Marcus and I work.  There are plenty of bidders in town but it is a pretty horrid time - working 10 weeks straight mostly through the nights and as you would expect no-one appreciates it!  I am really missing time with Scott.

Anyway hopefully better news coming.

Hope you are all well.

Take care all three of you

Louise (and Marcus and Scott)

Just wondered since we had not heard from you, whether you are  still there in view of all that has happened with Enron. How is Scott  doing?
 
Hope to hear from you sometime soon.

Piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet. 

EOL is not for sale today.

Here's my permission, in case you're interested.

If you want ENW to work in the same direction as you, let us know what the goal is beforehand.  You know I've tried to communicate.

Talk with richter and louise together if possible. Initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but I think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal. 
Greg Piper

We've sorted this. They'll get packages in next couple of days. Distributions from savings plan may take a while.

I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. 
* * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * 	
We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. 
Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. 
But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  Total Headcount at 874 and Total Bonus $s at 13,019,750 
Couple of things to note:
 Based on Zufferli sheet, I added 11 names to the Canada number but could not split btwn trading and orig
Probably need to verify Canda number with Milnthorpe.  I noticed Disturnal was not on the list.  Is that an error?
Did not see tax listed on Master cover sheet.  Tax would result in an add of 4 headcount and $220,000.
Portland had several changes adds in blue  

Please call with any questions.

Let's get some time tomorrow.

Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.

Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too.

I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.

Can we discuss?

Thanks

I can send you people.

Jay Webb and Jenny Rub can do the rest.

Hello Mrs woman of many words,

Enron Europe is in administration but the administrators have a huge talent for destroying value very quickly.
EBS is in liquidation.

You're still there then.  Is Enron Europe in administration or liquidation?

Hello Sweeeeetie,

I am on the phone to Nikki who is sunning herself at home oops I mean looking for a job and cooking for mum - she gives you a big hullo!!!

I hope you are bearing up well and look forward to having a 1996 newton with you in London.

Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.

Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.
It works - we have enough people to do it.

In terms of the Estate:
The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.

In terms of NewCo:
EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

We need to add the word energy to the 'ubs warburg' on the top left hand corner of our screen.  
So it reads UBS Warburg Energy.

I altered it.

Bob was shown at 150 on the HR list, which did not agree with what was on the list you gave me. 

I am going with what was on the list you gave me. Please confirm you did not intend otherwise.

Thanks,

Dave

You don't ever need to sell to me.
I'll let you know progress as we move forward.

Fine

Hi Louise,

I've identified the three folks.  We will contact them in the next few hours.  I was thinking that 4-5 would be a better number, though, since the attrition rate will be high.  What do you think?

--jay

Working name only

Hi Louise,

Is this going to be the new name or is it a working name?  If it is the actual name, we can get the verisign registration done, and begin some graphics work.  Otherwise, I'll hold on that.

--jay

just rang me - they want to meet with John Sherriff and Joe Gold?????????????  What is going on?????????????  They are going very deep into reserves too.

You'll need to talk to Wes I think he is about to shut them down

I believe they are interested in UK/EUROPE as a second step to Netco. What do you mean deep into reserves ?

John Malowney, Director, Netco
"Middle Group" - no retention bonus paid to date
Solid performer - made $4MM last year
Not sure where he is going - maybe skiing

I told him he's reporting to you and Milly and he was pleased.

Are you listening or video conferencing into this meeting?

Can you please include the following

John L. suggested I pass of this request to you.  

As you work a deal for NewCo I wanted to make sure that we include the various tools we use in structuring for pricing and evaluating deals (i.e., we want to make sure the NewCo will have the exclusive rights to this information).  Kelli has provided a basic list of this information below.  Most relates to the exotica functions (and any associated code) that Research has created for structuring deals.  I am forwarding a copy of this to Jim Meyn to see if he has any additional needs.

Thanks.

Mark,

Attached is the list of materials we would request to have access to in the new company.  Please let me know if you have any questions of changes.

Thanks,
Kelli

 

We intend to assign the current ones.

Once we have a buyer, subject to their approval, I would like to offer Broker Client contracts to the existing Brokers, with the first x months free with no obligation to continue (but hopefully they will, and will pay us). I think this will help us to rebuild volumes.

Please let me know if you disagree.

Apart from the estate EOL people

Louise, 

I want to make sure we are on exactly the same wavelength here:

EnronOnline (i.e. the people on the list you gave me) now reports to you through me and therefore is no longer a part of Enron Networks.

Right?

Barbara,

It's Saturday night in Houston and Marcus (my husband) and I just hung your painting in our dining room.  It looks unbelievable - we love it.  I decided because I loved it too much to bring in home and it is now in our home.  Thankyou so much .

Tammie will sort our the money on Monday.

I love it so much I had to bring it home.It is far too good for work.

Take care and obviously our thoughts are with you at this time.  We look forward to the yellow one and we have already decided where to put it.  I will take so photos so you can see how prominent the red one is in our home.

Take care 

Louise

Louise & Tammie,
I want to thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent me, they are really
nice.
I really appreciate all your attentions with me.

Tammie as we agreed last Friday i was thinking that the easiest way to send
me the money for the painting is makingg a deposit on my mom's US account.

Name: Diana Morales de Martinez
Bank: Wells Fargo Bank Texas, N.A.
Account #027-4729060

PDT. Louise: I'm very happy that you liked your painting!! The "yellow" one
is almost finished and Tammie's painting it is ready! I'm just waiting it to
let it dry so I can send it. (those are Christmas gifts for both) Those are
on me!

Thanks again and talk to you on Monday.
Warm Regards,
Barbara

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.

Dear Linda

I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.

I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.

I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.

I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.

Regards

Louise Kitchen

I have an important question, so I'll e-mail it to you so you have time to
respond accordingly. I'm creating the final list of which of the "Key Women
in Energy" will be attending the awards ceremony in Essen, Germany on 14
February, and don't have a response from you yet. If you'd like to attend,
we'd love to have you. At the same time, I understand your world is changing
daily. All the same, it might be nice for you to meet the other women and
for the other women to meet you. Please do let me know if you plan to
attend, or, given your schedule, if there is the possibility you could
attend.

So far, I think there are 15 women who have committed to attend - from as
far away as Australia, the US, the UK, Bulgaria and Germany. We're all
gathering for dinner on Feb. 13, and many of us are meeting earlier than
that to explore the German countryside. I've been taking German lessons all
winter so hopefully we'll get by.I'd be glad to help better understand the
conference setting and details if you'd like. Several of us are gathering in
Essen over that weekend and early that week to meet one another, share a
meal, and get to exchange stories. You've personally done much for the
energy industry and might be surprised what a warm welcome you could receive
for your extensive efforts to lead the team that built EnronOnline.

Please do let me know so I may complete reservations, etc. Many of us are
staying at the same hotel, so it should be interesting.

Did we get sign off from Jim Petrie?

Louise,

I was doing a last pass through these documents, when I noticed that the last sentence of the 2nd to last paragraph contains something similar to what you had removed from the ETA: "UBS may give Counterparty's name to potential product providers as a prospective counterparty". This wording was changed in the PA in Sept. so was not redlined in the changes you and I reviewed earlier.

I'm OK with this staying in. Please let me know if you want it removed.

Dave

Please review the attached PA and ETA. These are the final versions of the documents that we plan on using. The PA might go out to the top 50 customer as early as this afternoon. We are preparing the UBSWenergy 'splash page' and will upload this version of the ETA unless otherwise advised.
The entity is officially named UBS AG, London branch (collectively "UBS") and the Website is UBSWenergy.com. If you are not in agreement with this, please advise ASAP.
I encourage everyone to read both of these documents very carefully. I have looked them over several times and everything looks to be in order but your 'fresh' review is appreciated.
Thanks.

Louise, 
Do you anticipate needing one more set of OOC executive furnishings or will 2 satisfy us?

Thanks,

What decision was made?  I have no idea.

Louise,
I obviously don't agree on the decision that was made.  The decision to make me a director in the new company should be based upon my abilities as a marketer and the specific role that you want me to undertake for UBS.  Needless to say, I am disappointed but signed the document as the deadline approached quickly.

We want you in the new company.   We have really been trying to get you happy.

What are they having?

Let's go to dinner at Lagrasta's. 

Hunter says Bass is in.

i found foster.  i think that he'll be in.  he is stopping by my house tonight.

Choi is out - we probably want to use some of his $ to increase Foster's contract

I meant 200k and 200k for Sandra.  Grigsby is confusing me.
Brawner done at 100k and 100k
Davies done at 325k and 325k

Whitt is fine at 150k and 150k @if Lucci is at 50k and 50k @if we offer employment to Theresa Staab who is a scheduler.

Also all of us may be going to NY on Thursday morning.  

As shankman would say 'working ya'

We are dropping a lot of marketers. It would be nice to keep 1 or 2. 

Ok by me.  

I saw an offer letter to teresa staab so if we didn't give it to her its on the reserve list somewhere.

David - did it go out?  If so whitt is done

Tried to call but couldn't reach you - I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them.  
I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news.

I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming.

Did you see Laura's message.  It reads like she is in.

Currently at the drug test place there are lots of ene people on the list

It doesn't work - either get something which does or set up a meeting

The last I heard was that you wanted legal to prepare a physical power GTC which was similar to what we had online before and Leslie Hansen was trying to convince you otherwise.

The supplied document is nine pages of elections and amendments to the EEI. The EEI itself is not included.

The blank lines in the elections sheets are, I am told, optional, and are included in order to give a true representation of the standard elections sheet to the EEI. Obviously, when displayed online, these blank lines cannot be filled in.

Dave

I don't think I do  - I thought Elizabeth said she would use a reference document - not the EEI.

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Dave

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Well that's ok if we don't - I have no idea what Stockman's view is and heis back tomorrow.  Its easier to control money if we have the conversations.

Currently at the drug test - there is a long list of people from ene who have been here today.

You might want to ring Port - he wants the same numbers as Bill Bradford - so double what he has now.
There is a lot of disclosure around and so he thinks after he had bad treatment in the bonusses - the same is happening now.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Everything has been somewhat confusing recently and I made a hasty decision to put you reporting through Legal (decision prompted by the community relations comment) - there will a dotted line into the desks.

I hope you are happy with this if not we can unwind but following many conversastions with them over the last few weeks - it really has been Lou Eber dealing with all the reg issues.  

I really believe that putting Reg in the legal area is the best choice to ensure your group doesn't fall down any cracks as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in  UBS.

Did you get your contract?

not at the moment - we have 160000 spare (assuming schweiger is in)

Do we have the money to do what Presto wants?  

I agreed terms with greg can you get my contract ready for me to sign tomorrow at 2pm.

Thanks

Get then to ring greg if nec - I really want to be able to tell people I've signed

David 

please make sure all team leaders have this or a smaller version.

Appreciate there will be a great deal of activity over the 3 day weekend in relation to the contracts and offer letters we just distributed. Here are arrangements for the weekend to ensure you know how to get things done:

Contract or offer letter Changes
UBS will be keeping a team in Houston (at the Houstonian) to continue to produce contracts in the event we find errors or we need changes. Any changes to compensation terms, title or alteration to contract wording (ie not errors), need to be discussed and approved by Louise, John and Greg. In the event of their agreement or the need for simple correction, please contact following:

			Enron HR Rep					UBS Contacts
Houston Commercial	Jeanie Slone		713-553-7049 (cell)	see attached.
Portland (all) 		Amy Fitzpatrick		713-859-6266 (cell)	
Calgary  (all)		Either of above
Houston Support	Mandy Curless		713-516-0324 (cell)
			Neil Davies		713-857-4507 (cell)
									 << File: ubscontacts.xls >> 
They will complete attached form and shepherd the changes through Anthony Brown (UBS HR - cell phone 1-646-244-6311) and keep you in loop on any issues arising and the ETA of the revised document.
 << File: CONTRACT CHANGE FORM.doc >> 
Where any discussion takes place around whether we should change the wording of agreements, I will work with Michelle Cash and the UBS HR and legal team to agree and propose solutions. In this regard please contact me (713-922-2991) or Michelle (713-302-5522). 

Questions about offer letter or contract wording
Where aspects of the contract appear unclear or requiring explanation but not necessarily a change, please DO NOT refer the individuals directly in the first instance. But Michelle will again be on point to address these.

Questions about benefits or Comp or other HR issues referred to in above
Many individuals may want to discuss UBS compensation, benefits, policies or procedures. Below is the contact list for people to call to get answers to their questions:

Yes - I figured you would be doing the translation tomorrow - I can help if you like.

Have you read these policies?  We have a long way to go to get them to understand this business.....

     Hello all,

     Here is the latest draft of the day one GMCP for Energy Trading.  Any
     last minutes issues must be addressed tomorrow as we will be sending
     the policy to Marco and Walter for approval tomorrow at end of day.

     Also, please be aware that the EBK will be receiving this draft
     tomorrow.

     Thank you all for your help with this,

     Best,

Louise,

Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to Dave Walker in Media Relations.

I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a "management" slide. If there are others who should be
included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let me know who they are and their titles. Please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long.

Thanks again,

Claudia

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

(See attached file: UBSW Energy release draft.doc)
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed
that sentence.
(See attached file: UBSenergycomreleasedraft.doc)
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a
particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

    -----Original Message-----
   Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing
   the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
   transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The
   plan is to issue the closing announcement on
   Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for
   when the website officially launches, which is
   expected on Monday (2/11).

   Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media
   Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

   Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for
   Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
   global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the
   new management. I need from Human Resources
   confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In
   addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
   Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with
   Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
   posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There
   will also be internal publicity on the day the
   website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and
   intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
   integration site.

   Please let me know if you have questions.

   Thanks,

   Claudia

Not sure - I can't plan that far ahead at the moment.  We are just in the final stages of getting the part of the business I work for sold and therefore out of bankruptcy - I work for a company called Enron which has gone bankrupt.  We have just sold the trading piece to UBS so we are in the process of transfer and I have no idea what the new bosses will be like.

Are you going?

Louise

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

Message understood - we will try and accomodate Derek

Have a good week-end.

Louise, as per my conversation with John Lavorato, I will not be available this weekend to participate in the conference call.  The only concern I have at this point is that Derek Davies has not committed.  I strongly support and recommend moving his number up.

Regards, Rob

FYI

Just discussed this with Collette and UBS HR. Suggestion is we proceed as follows:

Any suggested change must be agreed by one of you on the Enron side (including support)
If you agree, we will capture the proposed changes on the attached form and fax it to UBS team.
If the change is simply a reallocation of dollars, as anticipated within the pool, they will generate a new contract.
If the change is incremental to the pool, or otherwise significant, Collette has arranged a time on Sat, Sun and Mon to call Hutch. If he agrees she will authorise the UBS team to produce the amended form.
I anticipate suggested changes to the document text and titles. These we will also capture on above form and fax to UBS for discussion.

Hi Louise,

I don't have any corporate allocation number yet. I'll check into it and also work to redo the plan. Thanks!

We are clearly close to completing the new numbers - could you work with Jeanie and Amy to put a new plan together.

Do we have any corporate allocation number from UBS?

Thanks

We need to do the move - can we meet today?

Louise- We need to get Netco people and UBS off the floor on 28. It is demoralizing to the remaining estate people and I am having a huge problem keeping people in their seats. Three have quit this week and we need the ones that remain. Can you make this happen rapidly? Thanks, Rick

I don't think I do  - I thought Elizabeth said she would use a reference document - not the EEI.

Louise,

Did you ultimately agree with legal that we would proceed with using the EEI as the GTC?

The GTC provided below is the EEI.

Dave

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

Long and boring story - at about 12 we got those admins but their were no numbers in them - zeros.  DAVID AND I sent them back - it doesn't change the numbers.

No arrangements - he just hasn't had a good year.  On a comparative basis I can't justify more.

Not for sale - sorry. 

Hope  you're well.

Louise

Greetings & Salutations!

I received a phone call from an agent with Martha Turner who had seen
your house when it was listed.  He has a client who cannot find what
they want on the market and asked if you were interested in selling.

I checked as thoroughly with him  as I could making sure it was not some
sort of bottom feeder looking for an Enron 'fire sale' and told him that
you had spent large sums of money renovating.

He says they are looking up to the low $2 millions.

I let him know I was not optomistic about it, but I would check with
you.

Hope all is well and you're surviving all of the garbage.

I am going to have Jim report to Haedicke with all of his people having a dotted line to the commercial desks - any issues let me know.

Louise & John --

FYI.  

1.	Charles Yeung has decided to leave the company.  He was in the ERCOT box support Doug Gilbert-Smith.  

2.	I met with UBS counsel today to discuss FERC and other licensing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Bob Dinerstein (sp?) sometime tomorrow to discuss the function and some other administrative issues.

3.	We continue to gather tariffs, etc. to process the forms as soon as possible.  Of course, the ability to sell physical power will be contingent upon FERC approval of Netco's MBR authority.

4.	I have postponed the FERC meeting scheduled for Thursday until sometime next week.  I still believe that it is appropriate to meet with FERC post-Bankruptcy Court approval (maybe HSR approval?).

Thanks,

Jim

Congratulations!  Have a good sleep.

Unfortunately - these guys did not make the cut this week-end.  Jeanie, can you please ensure this is dealt with.

Louise:
This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.  

It is my understanding that they run on the same ERMS/TAG systems.  They still run their phys on TAG rather than SITARA which I think could continue. 

John,

This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.

Risk Book:	1 full time
Logistics:	1 full time

Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs

Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.

Lee J.

We are clearly close to completing the new numbers - could you work with Jeanie and Amy to put a new plan together.

Do we have any corporate allocation number from UBS?

Thanks

Well...today is the day.  Elizabeth is having the baby.  No news yet.  I'll give you a buzz when I hear something.

As far as all the media says I have no other knowledge

Is the deal is signed and approved?

 

Which one?

Amy,

I anticipate we are going to lose an employee to a competitor this morning. Accordingly, I would like to revise our Estate/Netco transfer list.

Can I give you an update later today?

Dave

This is the procedure which currently is documented in the Product Control Function concerning the validity of a signature.

There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

Sorry I'm losing it.  We are going to hedge / manage our own interest rate risk so we will need infinity so can you please make sure its (infinity addons) isin the doc.  And also can you start planning to have infinity up and running on day one.

Thanks

We will be managing our rates we need to plan on a software.  I'll find someone to do it.

Just a couple of suggested changes to both.

There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.

 
On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.
 
Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?

Thanks

Louise

Attached for your review are drafts of two news releases, one announcing the closing of the UBS Warburg / Energy
transaction and the other to announce the launch of UBSWenergy.com. The plan is to issue the closing announcement on
Friday (2/8) at about 8 a.m. New York time. The other is planned for when the website officially launches, which is
expected on Monday (2/11).

Please forward your comments directly to David P. Walker, head of Media Relations-Americas, sometime on Wednesday.

Tomorrow, I will send you drafts of the internal announcements for Friday and Monday. The plan is to issue on Friday a
global UBS Warburg email announcement from John Costas, announcing the new management. I need from Human Resources
confirmed titles for Louise Kitchen, John Lavorato and Kevin Presto. In addition, we plan for Friday an email from Greg
Whalley to employees who have signed on with UBS Warburg Energy, with Costas's announcement attached. (Both will also be
posted on UBS Warburg intranets, including the integration site.) There will also be internal publicity on the day the
website launches: another email from Whalley to Energy employees and intranet articles within UBS Warburg, including the
integration site.

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Claudia

So far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.  Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 -  15 less in Jay's area).

Status on var model question of "substantial change in 2001". ? 

Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.

True - oops

Actually, it will go "live" internally on Thursday morning for the simulation, prior to which time all substantial changes must be locked down, in order to allow for data cleanup prior to Friday's book to book transactions.

Dave

Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning.

Kal,

Below are preliminary comments from Communications and Marketing on the Web content. We will be making more minor
changes on Thursday, during the final review process, and review the site once it goes live next week.

I sent comments from Legal to you earlier today.

Please let me know if you have questions.

I agree but I don't know whether that is public

Louise,

Just a thought - I think our pr people and outside law firm should stop refering to netco as a joint venture - it hurts our ability to get commercial and regulatory agreements in place.

Don

A bit of light entertainment!!

(See attached file: DoubleTree Show.ppt)

Where did he go?

We are now down to 38 (Ricky Oberai has left the testing group)

I believe all of the offers have come from Duke.

Dave

dream on!

Louise,

As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP:

1) PA and ETA approval
2) Agreement on new company name ("Netco" replacement) and new online system name ("NetcoOnline" replacement)
3) Approval of Press Release

I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase.

Thanks,

Dave

We are swiss

Excellent

 For all you guys who had dealings with Structure ...

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

This is the issue concerning encumbrency (Sp?) certification.

Louise

There are several elements which have been relied upon in the past to verify the authority of the person signing a Password Application:

1) Direct knowledge of the individual signing. The energy community is relatively small. In most cases, we have personal knowledge of the person signing on behalf of the counterparty and have done business with them in the past. 

2) Ostensible Authority.

3) 3rd Party Verification.

For 3rd Party Verification, the following procedure is used after Credit, Legal and Contracts departments have approved the Counterparty for online transactions:

?	The Main reception number at the applicant company is called and a senior contact in the Trading Department is requested

?	A Vice President or Director of trading is requested for verification of the PA signatory as an authorized person to bind the company to Master Agreements and online contracts for commodity trading purposes. The company is informed that the phone call is being recorded.

?	Date, Name, Title and Phone Number of person who verifies the applicant is recorded in three places:  1) Access Tracking Database and 2) Online Trading Operations Control Form and 3) Recorded telephone conversation.

The Master User ID is forwarded to the customer only upon the verification of the authority of the applicant.

I am thoroughly confused - we are not putting the master on line.  Where is the short form GTC?  Please provide short form GTC today -  thanks.
Louise:

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I am currently working with Enron Global Markets.  I am very interest in pursing my career in the energy market as a Sr. Admin within Enron's reorganization.  I worked in the Crude trading group on the 3rd floor of Enron Center South.  I have been with Enron for ten years and the majority of those years have been with the trading environment.

I understand that the new company will consist of most of the employees currently in gas and power, but if you find that you will be in need of additional help, please consider me as a candidate.  If you would like for me to send you my resume please let me know.  I would love to work for your organization.

Hey - fantastic news.  I am so pleased - take it easy.

Louise

ps all still crap here

Louise

I hope you and the family managed to get home for Christmas - I know Swift thought it was uncertain when we last spoke to you.  Judging from the papers, you must be in the thick of it - I hope you do better than BP's published offer for the Enron Online software!

If things don't work out and you find yourself homeward bound, spare a moment to ensure than any taxes due to be paid by Enron are up to date - we have been struggling to get someone to focus on a UK tax liability created in April 2000 when Tom exercised options (in the US) and for which a much greater US dollar tax withholding was made by Enron at the time - but no-one bothered to pay the Inland Revenue!  It seems that we are making some progress at last in that it is being submitted to the Cash Management Committee for consideration - do you know whether its possible to lobby that body???!

Best wishes to you all - just got back from Gymboree's exercise class for 2 year olds!  Tom is at his career transition counselling service - I've got my fingers crossed that his next career isn't too bizarre!

Anna

If we have twins - doesn't it matter that we make more money for American Pie than we do with Hans - due to bigger group of people.  Therefore percentages need adjusting.  Or are we done?

Excellent

 For all you guys who had dealings with Structure ...

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

Good news - let's focus on getting the data this afternoon when we know the winner.

John & Louise --
 
See the note below from our outside FERC counsel.  We are targeting meeting with FERC Staff in DC on Thursday Jan 17.  Still aiming to also meet either Thur or the following Fri with Commissioners offices.
 
Sam indicates that FERC General Counsel viewed expediting our application poorly for fear of appearing partial.  As important, Sam indicates that Netco may need to make concessions (in what form and manner not sure) to appease staff to not hold up our application beyond 60 days.
 
As soon as you know the winning bidder, we will begin finalizing the FERC filing.
 
Thanks.

FYI 

   
         Sarah - As you and others requested, I called Cindy Marlette, Acting General Counsel at FERC, to set up a meeting re the FERC filing for NETCO.   She has set up a meeting for 10 a.m. on the 17th, with the Staff.  We talked a little bit of substance.  She was curious as to what actually was being transferrred, and knew nothing about the atructure or substance of the deal.  When I raised the subject of asking for expedition, she indicated that significant expedition was unlikely, because the Commission "didn't want to give the appearance of partiality."   I told her I understood, but that we didn't want to become the test case for the SMA standard or do anything else that would take us beyond sixty days. She understood that.    Given the ciurcumstances, I think 30 days is the very minum we can get, and that something around 60 days is more likely.   If we get our signals crossed with Staff, it could be later.

Can we have them until we move?  That would probably be the easiest time to give them up.

Louise,

I know you are appropriately focused on the Netco sale, yet I had Tammie place me on your calendar for 4:30 p.m. today.  I want to discuss my withdrawal as a potential employee of Netco and my desire to remain with the Enron estate.  Consistent with my ongoing concerns regarding the Chicago office, I also want to ensure those employees remain with that business to preserve value to the estate.  They have done an amazing job on behalf of the joint venture and PEC has voiced their desire that they are retained on PEC's behalf, no matter the counterparty.

I wanted you to know my direction even if your schedule would not permit for our meeting today.

Thank you,

Laura

Current costs.  In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.  Gets us around the $200mm mark.

 

50% or less of the current group.   We have a market of 1 year = $x, so we'll need more cash for less people.   We may need our spare cash to fund the $12mm for the back office etc.

What do you think happens if they require 2yrs?

A bit of light entertainment!!

(See attached file: DoubleTree Show.ppt)

Didn't get a commitment. Just told them I thought it would be impossible.

Did you get tg back to 1yr docs

How is it going

Its the old NGL group.  I presume propane, butane etc

Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.  My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.  Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone.

Can you respond to greg on this.

You definitely don't have room inder the TG headcount. Who are the people and what do they do?

Expensed them.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.

Thanks for your late and long hours.

I am trying to get the EOL forms done by end of day tomorrow.   have not been able to effectively extricate myself from the Citibank deal, thus I am slowed on the forms.  I think it is a cart and horse issue--doing the best I can.  Mary

Did you ever receive a refund check from ADT Security?

Expenses:
They have informed me your $5,000 payment was issued on 1/4/01 and it takes 10 business days to arrive.  It was mailed here so I will keep an eye out for it.  They also said all of you expense reports have been processed but they can not pay the remaining balances until they get approval from Enron.  I will keep on top of it.  Have you heard anything else about us getting paid our remaining balances?

Louise, 
I suspect legal, documentation, and accounting will have a need for filing space.  Do you have any objections to a central file room on 5?  I will work with Kim Kegley to identify an appropriate place.

Thanks,

The def of "adjusted pre-tax income" requires a Business budget to be prepared by Seller ... do you know who will be providing this?  Will it be Louise Kitchen?

I suggest we kill this before the week-end.  Thoughts?

Louise:
This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.  

It is my understanding that they run on the same ERMS/TAG systems.  They still run their phys on TAG rather than SITARA which I think could continue. 

John,

This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.

Risk Book:	1 full time
Logistics:	1 full time

Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs

Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.

Lee J.

Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning.

Kal,

Below are preliminary comments from Communications and Marketing on the Web content. We will be making more minor
changes on Thursday, during the final review process, and review the site once it goes live next week.

I sent comments from Legal to you earlier today.

It looks like someone needs to talk to Jim Fallon for the Research software. Please let me know if you want me to talk to Jim.

Hello,

I talked to Jim Fallon and he told me not to release any software etc. to NETCO without a formal letter from him.

Please, make sure that we get this request ASAP, so that we can guarantee an orderly transition.

We have Restart/Integration draft plans in place for our business lines as defined below.  I have put the point person next to the function.  I have also attached an organization chart with phone numbers for each person.

The areas where we do need to quickly establish a process is that of the contracts (both customer and facilitation eg pipeline, pools etc) as we will need to move very swiftly in the implementation of contracts to speed re-start  ( I also attach the contracts which we will be entering into at the end of this note).  

Please let me know whether you would like a suite of the re-start plans, they are in the early stages but aim to be updated each day at the re-start meetings.

CONTRACT LIST

Spoke to the deal team - they understand the economics and have gone to speak to Bill.

How was it  - we are really busy so I thought I would ask in case i don't get to see you too much tomorrow.

You were missed

We'll need the headcount for commercial people and I know Legal want their assistants.  Hire them as contractors through an agency

Not sure if we had room in the 12 open positions or if we were able to add headcount at this point (I believe we added an admin spot in legal).  I will verify with David.

Where do we get the headcount room from?

Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

How long will it take?

Good morning Louise

Thanks for your order confirmation of the black matting only.  As this print

Put in -its important

Could you return my books

Kim mentioned that you're on the phone. Jenny designated the Disaster Recovery piece ($10M) and some other items as Capital Expenses, and we neglected to include this in our schedule. The total capital budget is $14.7M. I presume that you'll want to include this amount? 

What we currently have is expense plan of 24.9M with a 1.2 multiple equals 30.2m.

I think we'll want to amend it :

24.9M 	expense
14.7M	capital

39.6M	total (would you still want a multiple to increase to 47.5M?)

We have a call in for En Ops as well to make sure that there isn't any potential capital plan we might need to include.

Please let me know!

Yup

Thank you for taking the lead to prep and set up a meeting(s) to get the appropriate team(s) prepared to testify on January 24, 2002.

I realize that there will be many different activities underway in the next couple of weeks, and we all include maintaining / maximizing the value of the CA book and the CPUC activities as critically important.

Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.
  
Thanks

Louise

Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  

The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.

Pat

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

Ok on Sachs

I think that's a real problem with their money - how much each and how are the people?  Essentially - how material?

Bill may want to do a contract for Sachs at around 20/20. He's thinking about it and will let me know. Apparently RWE are chasing him.

NETCo ee's with nearly 5 years service at Enron
We have about 10 people who had they stayed at Enron estate for another 30 - 60 days would have vested in the Enron pension plan (cash-balance plan). We have tried to find some way to make something work here, but as it stands it looks like the are going to have to transfer on 8th of Feb and forfeit whatever was in this plan (roughly 5% of base salary per year and it is a 5 year service vesting arrangement). You may hear some noise.

For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.

Hope this helps.

Solarc is the system used for NGLs etc - we do not plan to convey it into NetCo.    In terms of the court case - the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy.  They did try and prevent the whole NetCo thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it.

What is the situation with a lawsuit involving Solarc?

Absolutely - thanks

Louise -

Claudia also mentioned a UBS handbook which has descriptions of the various UBS businesses - would you like copies of this as well?

I also sent an email to Chris and Rob to see if they need materials for Portland and Calgary.

Amy

Its an IT security issue - ask Jenny or Bob what they think the plans are - it would be better if we were near peole.

FYI

Kevin states that there is no near term conflict with estate and NETCO and is considering consolidating EWS estate on 3 & 4.  Please advise if you see issues related to  their plan.

Thanks.

 

Deborah and Janelle,

Mr. Fallon has asked for an estimated per person cost for moves:

1) within a building
2) between the Enron Centers

He also assured me that questions regarding conflicts between the estate and NETCO operating out of the same building had been addressed, thus there should be no problem with EWS consolidating on ECS 3&4 in the near term.

I also spoke with Rich DiMichele regarding the EBS move.  As we discussed, he obviously does not want to move EBS twice within ECN.  He is interested in bringing EBS over to ECS if wholesale will be here for any length of time.  Again, cost is obviously a concern, so the per person cost estimates you provide should facilitate this decision.  We can discuss this further at tomorrow's meeting.

Please provide me with copies of the marked up maps for ECS 3&4 as soon as possible so I can begin considering our options.  

Thanks,

Kevin

I had presumed it got transferred - Wes could you please sort.

There seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application.  It was Mary's and my understanding that the IP would remain with the estate and a license would be given to Netco to use the application.  Jay was under the impression that the IP was to be transferred to Netco.  Could someone please clarify.  

The estate (Mary Perkins) would like the IP to remain with the estate.  If this is a problem - please call Mary directly.

Thanks,
Beth

We need these for Netco - is it too late?

Louise,

IT needs source code and documentation for all Exotica library functions. In addition, we need the Excel add-in build environment for building the exotica DLL and its help functionality. We need documentation for all models used by traders and risk managers. Naveen has a list of those models. My group can help maintain those models and the exotica library and provide IT expertise. I will help get a complete list of models used. Following is the list of Exotica functions.

Louise, 

I am intending to start getting brokers signed up as soon as we know our new company name and have the PA and ETA forms authorised.

Do you think we need explicit buyer authorisation before we start signing up brokers?

Dave

It is going to be really difficult to do the split, eg the EnronOnline patent is moving, can we take all of the history of  concerning that which is on drives etc

Unless I am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal, does this mean we can do without this.

Information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to (i) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and (ii) with respect to power, the need for FERC approval .  Everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed, as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty.  Consequently, the software going to Netco will  be cleansed of the trade data and individual's data bases and files should be similarly cleansed.

Angela D. Davis
Why is this necessary in the first place? I really do not understand why it is necessary.

Paula Corey has informed that the IT people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "to be Netco" employees'
h drive
existing e-mail
home directory

The recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to Netco employees obtaining access to them.  Further, the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating.  I do not know if not telling people is fair.  However, absent some other solution, it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable.  Would you be the person to instruct the IT people to delete and/or announce to "to be Netco" employees that this will occur?

Hi there,

I wanted to ask you guys, if you know of any jobs that Nicki Daw could do, she would like to stay in Houston for a while longer,  I know she won't ask you herself as she did leave on the 31st December, but if we can get her a job maybe her employment could be reinstated and last week could be vacation.  If you know of anyone looking for a brillant assistant or someone needing some to coordinate a project, please put in a word. Nicki is in the office today and will be in Houston for about three more weeks.

Thanks

Where does this patent reside - in the Estate or NetCo?

With respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the U.S., we may now designate those non-U.S. countries in which we are seeking patent protection, or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months.
 
If we wish to designate the appropriate countries now, we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before February 28, 2002.   If we elect to postpone the process, we must file an notice to that effect on or before January 30, 2002.  One benefit of taking the ten-month extension of the process is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will review our patent application and issue a non-binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions (novelty, inventiveness, industrial applicability) that are required in order to be patentable.  
 
Please let me know whether we should designate countries now, or file for the extension.  It may be that we want to let the dust settle on the NETCO transaction before making this decision.

Please note new address and fax number:

Travis C. McCullough 
 

I was envisaging something like the one talked about for Canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time.  Netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in Feb and March where the majority of the value is for this contract.

I think this needs to go to Louise who originated the message.  Don and I agree with fully with Dave and yourself.   

Absolutely agree with Dave.  Any services agreement should be invisible to the market and Newco should be seen as the conterparty.  The services agreement should just pertain to the time that Newco does not have the staff to service it...as short as time as possible.
Guys, the nature, term, etc of any such agreement will have to be agreed to by Jeff McMahon. I would not be supportive of any long-term services agreement without a very close examination of the economics. A term agreement, at the right price, where NewCo continues to control the business relationship and optionality may be a win-win and provide maximum benefit to the estate.

Regards
Delainey
FYI

In order to get Peoples up and running as soon as possible - we will need (as Netco) to enter into a service agreement with the Estate - can you set this up with Don or Jim.

Where do we get the headcount room from?

Louise, 

The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll

Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  

We have two options:
1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.

Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.

Please find attached the Integration Plan for Power Risk Management.  If you need this information consolidated or expanded just let me know.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Superb

Would you mind adding responsibility names to each.

EOL - if you mean the GTCs is in addition to the contracts below we require by Thursday.  Mark hasn't left me a message but I'll put a phone call into him.

EOL gas by Thursday--we need to talk re whether you want firm and IT combined in the EOL GTC, and discuss masters.  Mark has a call into you for us.

Next Tuesday was tomorrow - could we try for Thursday as it really is onerous to get stuff through the new buyer.

Thanks

Louise

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me. 

The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

Can we meet after we are sold - things are very hectic now.  How about some time in February?

Happy New Year. 
I know you must be very busy, but I would enjoy the  opportunity to spend a few minutes with you to discuss the former CommodityLogic  group, now CLPartners.
Please let me know where and when would be  convenient for you.

In order to get Peoples up and running as soon as possible - we will need (as Netco) to enter into a service agreement with the Estate - can you set this up with Don or Jim.

Next Tuesday was tomorrow - could we try for Thursday as it really is onerous to get stuff through the new buyer.

Thanks

Louise

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me. 

The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

Attached is the Govt & Reg Affairs Re-Start Plan for Netco.  As you know we are already making calls and preparing for the FERC power marketing certificate.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Same with this one

Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

Needs Duran alteration

Louise, Attached please find our ERCOT business plan for your review.  Doug and I have jointly put together a trading/marketing detailed plan to get ERCOT restarted as quickly as possible.  We have separated the plan in three tiers to prioritize tasks and customers in order to expedite earnings for early 2002.  

One thing you should note is that in ERCOT we will not need a FERC power marketing license to start trading physical power due to Texas not being regulated by FERC.  Therefore if there is a drag on obtaining the FERC license, ERCOT should be in the lead for regions getting restarted.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks, - Mike

 

Harry/Jay, can you help come to some conclusion on this.

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

Jeff

I'm happy to take their names off the list, but are we sure this is the right thing to do?

If so should I put any new names in their place?

David
David/Jeanie - 

I just spoke with Bob Hall and he informed me that he and Leslie Reeves have decided to stay with the estate.  Please let me know what is the future plan for these functions and/or who will be the contact for the groups when you know.  Thanks. 

Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.

Take care

Louise

Happy New Year Louise.   Hope things are going okay down in Houston with the bidding process for NetCo. etc., and that you were able to take some holiday.   I want to thank you again for facilitating my transfer back to Canada.  I was really enjoying working in the Toronto office; the people are impressive and the opportunity in the Ontario market is definitely massive and exciting.  

For now, I'm going to be working on the 'estate' side of things for Enron Canada, but meanwhile, I've also started investigating some interesting opportunities outside (i.e. retail opportunities, online platforms, etc.). 

Anyway, per below, are you okay with ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK getting transferred over to Centrica ?

Please let me know when you get a chance.  All the London IT guys that were dealing with this appear to be gone, so I'll follow up as appropriate. 

Thanks, 
Paul

Centrica are not connected to TXU (aka Eastern Group) to my knowledge. At least as of October when I left London, they were competitors in the marketplace.

Is Centrica somehow related to TXU UK Limited?  I seem to remember that they were granted a license to use the name EnronDirect for 6 months in connection with a sale of Enron Direct (UK).

	I think that is a good idea.  Louise should be able to tell you if she still has interest in the name.

That's fine. If you like I am happy to respond to him, but I'll run it by Louise Kitchen first to make sure she is happy with the domain name being transferring over to Centrica.

Thanks,
- Paul

	This is a business decision not a legal one.

Mark (and Mark) - Happy New Year, I hope you are doing well.   Could one of you get back to Josh Bourne at Register.com about this?  Register.com has been helping us manage our corporate suite of domain names.  My assumption is that provided the acquisition of Enron Direct (UK) by Centrica plc has been finalized, we should allow the domain name transfer to occur (though only for ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK as opposed to ENRONDIRECT.CA, ENRONDIRECT.COM, or other Enron Direct URLs). Will leave it to you to decide next steps...

Dear Friends,

I realize that some of you may no longer be at Enron.  I am very sorry about
what has happened and wish you all the best for a pleasant and productive
2002.  I need to make you aware of a situation that makes me very nervous.

We have been contacted by Nominet, the Registry for .UK domains.  Nominet
has asked us to free the domain ENRONDIRECT.CO.UK and allow it to transfer
away to a third party: Centrica Plc

Please advise whether we should follow these instructions at your earliest
(most urgent) opportunity.

Furthermore, if you have a moment, call me in order to sort out some open
domain matters.

Best regards,
Josh

We don't need to use the Special events people.  Obviously I don't have a corporate  card.

Collette - help!

Louise, maybe you can call Hutch and see if he is OK with us getting the UBS special events people on this. Either that or can we have your credit card!?
Louise,

Do you think we should arrange events for the remote offices as well?

Thank you,
Julie

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie  
we need a big party organizing for everyone - please sort.

Thanks

So I have a couple of people in my team trying to organise something for Friday. Would either or both of you be game to do a floor talk, presuming we have closed?

David
For the shin-dig we'll have on Friday (if Hutch approves), do you thing we could get John, Louise, and Greg to say a word?

Are you sure - david and ellie's outbound flight is 1731

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

The only item open, I think, is a deal with EC Outlook concerning the EDI Hub.  Jay  and Bob
McAllif are working with them. Won't need right way, used for physical gas.

He is also working on a list of contracts needed with the pipelines and LDC's.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)

Louise et al

We have began the following initiatives to have a structuring function ready for operation within NETCO as well as other related issues to be addressed:

Structuring Model Capabilities - We are moving all of the existing gas and power structuring models into a directory to be transferred to NETCO at the appropriate time. We will need to provide the estate with formal documentation (from yourself and/or Jim Fallon) for the transfer of these assets into NETCO (per Vince Kaminski's request). These models have historically been property of the Research Group. We have initiated the process of transferring the ownership of this to a designated IT person within the NETCO organization.(See attached for more detail)
Deal Processes/Controls - Once Legal/Credit formalize the contract forms we will be using for NETCO, we should discuss a deal approval process to implement. I would assume the old ENA process would be the template we would follow with adjustments to be made for new corporate structure/ownership, appropriate approval levels of transactions,etc. Issue - Will there be a RAC-like group to provide overall deal documentation? I'm sure this issue will be addressed as transactions start to hit the radar and the collective owners of NETCO will sign off on a control process.
Back Office Execution Capability - Once the structuring models and the risk systems have been formally moved to the new IT enviroment, we will begin testing the models to the risk books to ensure valuation accuracy. We may want to talk about the reporting mechanisms from both the risk system and structuring models to include Cash Flow reporting tools in addition to MTM reporting. This may be a useful tool to front-end manage our cash position/exposure.

I've also attached a table with details of the above initiatives and estimated timelines. 

Please call me with questions.

Let's get together for 5 mins on Monday

In general:

Commercial and Energy Ops on 6.

5 would be all the support functions apart from energy ops.

Also we need a resort of the commercial teams

Can you let me have a couple of blank sheets again.

Thanks

Louise
 

Attached is the first draft of the 6th floor plan.  If you are fundamentally in agreement with the locations of these groups, we'll ask department leads to put final names on seats.  

 << File: 6th floorplan 01.04.xls >> 

The 5th floor would accomodate IT, Accounting and Energy Op's (excluding logistics/scheduling).

Phase one will include moving estate people off the floors - best case Tues/Weds pm.
Phase two will include moving the people already on these floors to new locations - best case Weds/Thurs.
Phase three will include moving people from the Enron North building over - best case to be determined. 

Regards,
Tammy

I would hope that in the negotiations of the master we can remove the confirm provision.

Let's discuss Monday

Couple More:

1) I heard a rumour that we will not be sending confirms when we relaunch. Is this correct? (I hope not)

2) Have you thought more about the PA's without Buyer name issue?

Dave

Woops

Is a holiday.

(Martin Luther King Day)

Accordingly, I will plan on Jan 22 as our tentative launch date.

Dave

Sorry only just got to read this.

I sort of see EOL group as getting the customers to the point of being able to click and our marketers doing the masters.

Looks like we will not get approval anyway - see you Monday morning.

What did we send - it in or out??

Louise,

Three questions/issues which I'd appreciate your feedback on:

1) I am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators/traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers (sending draft PA's) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers.

2) After some more thought, I'm on the fence about sending out the PA's without names. The following occurs to me:
	- Sending them out on Tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
	- Sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
	- The PA/ETA is a very simple form; customers probably don't require the extra three days to review them.
	- Following the public release of our new Buyers' identity with the first release of the PA helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise.

3) I understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers' name to another company. I don't think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later. Can we keep this in?

Thanks,

Dave

We'll need to adjust then.  What did Donnelly say?

Just a quick FYI;

If we end up doing deal with Umbrella, our review of their benefits package seems to indicate it will cost many of employees significantly more for the same level of medical and dental coverage, as much as $5000 pa.

I plan to raise this with John Donnelly and see if we can negotiate a softer landing for people, but I wanted you to know that this will cause quite a stir if we proceed without any pay rises or special subsidy for the rank and file.

David

Buyer to handle

What do you think?

Tammie -- Happy New Year.  I am preparing a plan for designing/printing collateral materials (stationary, envelopes, etc.) for Newco since we will need to do a big mailing announcing the new trading web site. 

It occured to me that Newco employees will want new business cards as well.  Is the buyer going to handle printing business cards for us?  If not, I can help mock up some designs and talk to some printers about getting them printed quickly.  My thought was that we send out an e-mail to employees (around Jan 14th) with an order form where employees can put in their business card info. and submit to me.  Our group can collect all the orders and hire a printer to do one mass business card print run.  This will save money and create a consistent look for business cards.  When you can, pls. let me know what you think.

Thanks

Kal

CAn you get me the new list

To confirm:

Mark Thomas
Mike Presley

both previously on the list for Netco's Market Risk/Research Group have resigned.

I'm combing the Estate for replacements.

Its the week-end so I am finally doing my emails.
 
I forgot to thank Leslie for doing these - so thanks Leslie it was appreciated.

Attached please find the proposed Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application for Netco.  I have included a clean copy of each document as well as a red-lined copy marked against the version sent to Mark Taylor by Dave and Carl. 
 
You will note that I have made a number of changes to the original EOL documents.  
 
1.  The Password Application.
 
The Password Application contains no substantive changes.  I advise that we retain the original description of the website as a platform for the "purchase and sale of products and instruments based on energy products or other commodities (including derivative products)".  The description is sufficiently broad to cover any potential expansion beyond the original gas and power products, as well as third party product offerings.  After a brief discussion regarding the auction platform with Louise, I revised the PA to reinsert references to the auction.
 
2.  The Electronic Trading Agreement.
 
There are numerous revisions and additions to the ETA.  I outline below a few of the key changes requiring your consideration:
 
a.  I added a sentence at the end of Section 1 to make clear that in the event the ETA conflicted with any other agreement between the parties, including any terms posted on the Website, the ETA controls.
 
b.  I added a new Section 2(h) to address Counterparty content posted on any public area of the Website.  To the extent that we anticipate such a capability in the future, it may be a good idea to include such a provision.  If we do include this section, do we want to limit our license of the content to use on the Website and related materials, as proposed here?  If you do not want to include such a limitation, we can add the word "worldwide" to the first sentence before the word "royalty-free" and delete the balance of the final sentence after the phrase "not distorted by displaying only a part)".
 
c.  I revised Section 3(e) to clarify that Netco is not required to send written confirmations of on-line transactions and to provide that electronic records are admissible as evidence of the transaction.  The last sentence of the section is intended to make clear that to the extent the master agreement requires a written confirmation, such master agreement controls, provided that the failure to send a confirmation will not invalidate the transaction.
 
d.  I added a new Section 4 to address transactions posted by unaffiliated third parties.  (This issue was already covered in the last paragraph of the original PA.)
 
e.  I revised Section 5(a) to clarify that Netco is not liable for any direct damages and to expressly cap its damages to amounts paid by Counterparty for accessing the Website.
 
f.  I revised Section 5(b) and (c) in response to issues raised by many counterparties when I negotiated EOL ETA issues. 
 
g.  Section 6(a) has been revised to expressly provide that Confidential Information excludes counterparty identifying information, as well as transactional or biographical information in statistical form.  Please let me know if you disagree with the scope of this exclusion.  If you don't want to exclude counterpary identifying information, we can merely delete the phrase "the identification of Counterpartt as a user of the Website and shall also exclude".  I added a 1-year term following expiration of the ETA to the confidentiality obligation in Section 6(d), reasoning that most of the confidential information protected by this Section belongs to the Counterparty, not Netco, and thus desiring some cut off point for our obligation to maintain confidentiality.
 
 
A number of our counterparties enter into transaction by and through service companies or agents.  I have prepared a revised Password Application, side letter to the ETA, and Consent and Acknowledgment form to be utilized by such counterparties and attach these documents below for your review and reference as well.
 
Please give me a call with any questions or comments.
 
Regards,

Yup

Louise,

Do you think we should arrange events for the remote offices as well?

Thank you,
Julie

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie  
we need a big party organizing for everyone - please sort.

Thanks

So I have a couple of people in my team trying to organise something for Friday. Would either or both of you be game to do a floor talk, presuming we have closed?

David
For the shin-dig we'll have on Friday (if Hutch approves), do you thing we could get John, Louise, and Greg to say a word?

Cheers

I'll make sure it stays in place.  JR

JR

I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it.

This is a reminder that the ect.enron.com,ei.enron.com,and ees.enron.com Email domains will be decommissioned by close of business Friday, January 18th. If you currently use an Email address of name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com or name@ees.enron.com, you will need to notify your contacts to send mail to you at firstname.lastname@enron.com.

This is the first step of several to standardize everyone's Email address to firstname.lastname@enron.com. 

If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. 
Enron Messaging Administration

To be clear, that is 10:30am New York time

>  -----Original Message-----

Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.

Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.

PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

To be sent when the Buyer is known.
When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

Password Application:

EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

Louise

Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
anything left to carve out??

Thanks

Rick

The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online
trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are
accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as
they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but
simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions
will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further
information.

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks

Yes - I think Tycholiz sees less value but definitely worth a look

Any interest in taking a look at this?  If it is clean and NETCO can get it for $0.50 on the dollar and if they dont need to close for several weeks, it might be worth having Tycholiz look at it.  

Chris Calger
503-464-3735

EES has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets. (CA, IL, NY, OH, etc)  To date the bids have been dismal.  We are down to one player looking at one market and they are bidding $0.30 on the dollar. ($US)  These deals are clean and could be managed fairly easily by NETCo.  It might be a stretch, but this morning, management suggested we find out if NETCo can do some due dilligence at this time and determine if we want to bid on some of the book.  I am available at (713) 345 4441 if someone wants to discuss.

Handouts please

Thanks

Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
5:45		Credit				Bradford
6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
			Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

		
Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

Louise

The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

I believe so

Fine

1) Do you know if NetCo is going to have similar arrangements in Canada to what we had before bankruptcy? (e.g. trader in Houston trades Eastern Canada on behalf of ENA, but trader in Calgary trades Western Canada on behalf of ECC)

2) Looks like we might have to prepay 1 month to preserve Reuters content. I'm assuming this is no big deal, as we will still be month-to-month and can cancel.

Dave

I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it.

Shall we toss for who rings back?  Its going to be a long conversastion.

Like you, I am getting very frustrated with this process.  I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible.  I am not trying to "hold up" the deal at the last minute.  I'm afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company (I don't mean the two of you -- I mean Enron) has screwed me and the people who work for me.

I am generally ok with the concept of the option, the doc, and comp parameters.  In addition, I need assurances that 90 day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and haven't received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in 2001 is secure. 

It is unlikely that I would be here today if it weren't for the collective comp conveyed to me during 2001.  I have received assurances from the two of you, Oxley, and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received.  The messages generally start with "it's safe," "don't worry about it," "all comp paid in 2001 advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate," "low probability that there will be any issues," ....  At other times, particularly when you want me to commit to this deal, the logic changes.  The comp paid in 2001 becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if I'm on the team.  While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days, it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do.

When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in 2001 the answer is that it is off the table -- a non-starter.  Why?  
Because the estate is negotiating the deal.  Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me.
Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate.  I wouldn't be here but for the legacy issues with the estate -- it is definitely the buyer's issue!
Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee.  I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estate/the buyer have time.
Because we don't know who from the buyer to negotiate with.  Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues -- why not figure it out now.
Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden.  I'm not delusional.  I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts.  If it's bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me.

Since I am not "on the team" right now, I am also working with a great deal less information than you have.  I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people "on the team" versus not "on the team."  However, the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind.  For example, I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done, conveyed to the creditors/buyer/estate/judge works.  Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them.  If that's the case, you could add my indemnification amount (adjusted by probability of payout) to that total and it surely wouldn't blow up the deal.  Unless, the probability of payout is high.

Furthermore, I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc (subject to comment from my lawyer, but I'll try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum).  I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer.  At that point in time, I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc.  Perhaps at that time, some of the 2001 comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier.  Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent.  I don't understand why this is a non-starter issue, but I don't have the same information that you do.

To be clear, here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer:
the deal as it exists plus
retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them.
indemnification of 2001 comp up to $4 million.

I expect that the two of you will tell me that I'm not on the team, that 800 people are going home, and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives.  That is not what I want to happen.  If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldn't happen.  I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions.  I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have.

In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in.  I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days.  I trust that you are trying to do the right thing.  There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time.  

Finally, I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier.  It's probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say.  I will call to see that you received and read this e-mail.  I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do.

Tim

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen

Tammie - please check availability.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

Yup

Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally

I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts. 

--Sally

Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that was before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.  Any thoughts?

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally 

Organisational Charts have been requested by one of the potential Buyers.  Please send to Tammie by close of play tomorrow.

Thanks

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Did you do anything to it - I can't see.

Here is a start on the list.  We have a meeting with UBS in the AM to review as well.  Obviously, I am putting limits that we would be willing to extend from a Credit Perspective only.  Taking into account liquidity and commercial drivers may adjust these numbers.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.

Yes, these functions are covered in the Netco list put together by Bob.   Under the tab labeled "Documentation" in the electronic list sent to me by Amy Fitzpatrick, there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase "Global Management" - meaning global databases, including counterparty.  Bill Hare is on the Netco list, and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database.  Contract administration for gas and power has been handled by Kim Theriot's group, and Kim has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for Netco.  --Sally 

The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin.  Have we covered this function?

The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.  Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.  The PA is one page and the ETA several.  These are standard and not long.

Let's discuss tomorrow.

Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
timing issue I think but is important nonetheless.

Can you do on gas and power together.

Hi Louise.

This spreadsheet has life-to-date transaction counts for all counterparties for North American Gas and Power.  There are separate tabs for gas and power.   The top 50 in each case are highlighted.  Legal entitites are rolled up where it seemed appropriate (for instance, there are about 10 Aquila entities which are rolled up to a single Aquila count).

Janet,

Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.

Load

Power
ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand

Gas 
ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day

I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.

Duran removed him - why was he not originally included?

Louise -
 
I would like to add Nick Hiemstra (manager) to the SE orig team.  He's currently in the estate group.  He previously worked for Jim Meyn running power structuring for the SE.
 
I don't know the mechanics of moving someone from the estate to the Netco, but he would be a great addition.  I plan to include him on my org chart portion.  Please let me know otherwise.

Cc:     Lavorato, John 
The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- 

(i)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  

        The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     
(ii)    Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)                                                To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                           Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

        I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. 

Happy New Year 

Louise 

 
Chris -
 
Louise asked for org charts by the end of today.  I don't know if she wanted them to go down to this level, but below is the info for the southeast orig team.  This will cover orig for the SE and portions of the MW.  For now, Dave Duran and I will share coverage of the MW and Larry Valderrama will assist both of us.
 
Dave Duran is out today, so I've included his info below as well:
 
SE & MW - Mitch Robinson
- Abler
- Hiemstra
- Valderrama
- Rorschach
 
NE & MW - Dave Duran
- Wood
- Meyn

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

    

Genia:
I left the cover sheet in your chair with the changes that need to be made.  Can you please make those changes?  Thanks.

What happened to Don's salary?

Louise Kitchen
Chief Operating Officer
Enron Americas
Tel:  713 853 3488
Fax: 713 646 2308

I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.
 
Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.
 
Laura Luce

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks, 
Tammy 

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.  

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards, 
Tammy 

I have asked one of our deal team lawyers to send you a copy of the document.
Her name is Anne Koehler.

Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou=
t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.

All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.

I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.
Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser=
vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has n=
o way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enro=
n for everything from email, internet, network services and office applicat=
ions as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are c=
oncerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in =
Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastruc=
ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support =
services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy=
stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our =
Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support=
 their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications =
into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal w=
as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  =
Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it=
 may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges=
t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on =
the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro=
m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee=
n the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog=
ether a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

The AEP and Bridgeline deals must be investigated.  There is no way the est=

Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by =
Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books=
, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some co=
de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens=
ure the applications still talk to each other.=20
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio=
ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app=
lications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional perm=
utations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degr=
ee.=20
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin=
g their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise =
that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio=
n system level before the enterprise integration test starts.=20
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point).=20
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es=
tate and New Co.=20
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex=
ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to=
 support go live to production.=20
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve=
rsion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integrat=
ion Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too=
 tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility.=20
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co=
nversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical pa=
th for New Co.=20

Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi=
ng first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down=
 dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and fina=
ncial on Jan 20.=20
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A=
EP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and=
 HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need=
 to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w=
e're in synch.=20
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single l=
icense of Unify.=20
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for coun=
terparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must qu=
ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin=
g hard coded reference id risks.=20
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these =
potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi=
red to support day one trading.=20
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline cons=
iderations. The time window will be very small.=20

Core Conversion Team =20
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward

Sarah provided the list to Louise last week - it was a report run by Comp from SAP.  The following people were on the list and showing as withdrawn.
 
Deidre McAffrey 
Larry J Hunter
Larry G Cash
Jon R Lewis
 
In reviewing the information this morning, Deidre and Larry Hunter are showing as terminated effective 12/6/01.  It appears that we have the wrong Jon Lewis on the NETCO list - it should be Jon P (known as JP) Lewis.  JP is still showing active and we will have Kari Oquinn update the NETCO list to reflect the right employee.  With regards to Larry G Cash, today he is showing as active - the action must have been reversed last week as when the report was pulled, he was showing as withdrawn.
 
Please advise the status of Larry Hunter as he appears to be the only one still in question.
 
Kind regards -
Amy
 
 
 
 

Amy ran list from SAP to figure out who may have left since Dec 4 from NETCO identified names. Lavo asked for it urgently Dec 22ish and it was best we could do. Subsequently, I've asked HR reps to notify me of any resignations as they happen. Haven't had any news today although Robert tells me 11 resigned from estate today.
 
David
It was someone for David
Louise:  Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list?  We can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem.  --Sally 

HR gave the list to me - I hope they are still getting paid

Hector and Leslie

 

Larry Joe Hunter, Larry Cash, and Jon Lewis are all still with Enron.

Will you please find out why Louise thinks they are gone.

Thanks

The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.  Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).  I assume there are no problems but if so let me know.

Larry Hunter    - Documentation 
Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination 
Larry Cash - Gas Settlements 
Jon Lewis - Risk 

Seems Marla is the contact.

David,

Marla is going to track down the issues below.  As you know, we are trying =
our best to address issues like these once we are aware of them. =20

Louise,

I think the information below is a little exaggerated, but there is truth i=
n our suppliers having difficulty dealing with all the requests they have b=
een inundated with. I will ask Robert and Cynthia to take a look and perhap=
s they can give summarise better than I what the actual position is.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

I definitely had a black mat last time.

I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.

So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
      Freight $250.00  

Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.

Thanks for your help

Louise

Good afternoon Louise

Thanks for your email.  I have outlined some costs below for you.

MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
orders)
FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
Louise, you have mentioned a black mount - the mounts are the board that the
image is adhered to and is not visible.  Do you mean a black mat.  Your last
image was mounted with a cream mat, however in this instance I would use a
mist mat as cream would perhaps be a little yellow for this image.  Mist is
not as yellow.  There will always be a small black border between the image
and the mount.
Freight $250.00  - you will be happy to notice that the rates for shipping
have decreased a little.

Total cost $1366.45.

Louise, I hope the above information is helpful and if there is anything
else I can assist with please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from
you with your final decision.

Cheers
Fay

It's long but good.

Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that was before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.  Any thoughts?

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

No - please carry on.

UBS meeting went OK

Big Pig:

Met with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to Andy Zipper to provide to the CFO?  

UBS:

Eddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me Louise (through Amy Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in Houston within the next few days.  FYI. 

I'll sort

Louise,

John Donnelly said his deal guys would like to see a slightly more detailed org chart which addressed what the org structure and main functions were under each of the technical and support areas. He gave me impression he wanted to understand for example what Accounting/CFO team did exactly. I think the chart we sent them previously was fairly detailed on the main commercial, senior management and EOL areas, but was silent below Webb(dev'lp), Hall, Rub, Colwell, myself, Headicke/Taylor, Bradford, Buy?, etc.,

Should I send a request around or would you prefer to send it?

Ummm. Don't see an issue with expenses, although I'm sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc., Everyone I've spoken too has a domestic relo program and Citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now.

I'll see what else I can find out. Only thing I'd add to Chris's note is an agreement that he will move to Houston if we meet all "reasonable" costs.

David
Chris will obviously be relocating to Houston in the near future.  We need to make sure we cover all of the expenses.  How do you intend to do this under the proposed contract?

We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.
 
Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)
 
Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation
January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer)
January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process
 
It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.
 
Thanks

Does seem a bit of an issue - who is in charge of this?  Robert?

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=

Please advise.

Yes - all enabling agreements need to be included

What do we do about the Pipelines?  Do we include them in our Customer phases?

Thanks,

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions
+	Phase 1
+	Phase 2
+	Phase 3

No master on EOL.

GTC.

Louise,

The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.

Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so.

If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know.

Thanks,

Dave

No

The Weather group is the Meterologists and the Crude group are the original Fred Lagrasta marketers who were spun off under Randy Maffett - they will be brought back into the fold for gas marketing.

So we don't need mid/back office support.

The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --Sally 

I'm so sorry - hope things go ok

Andy- I will be out of office until friday. My mother in law had a heart attack on new years day and I'm dealing with that but will be flying back thurs pm and in office friday. If big pig people want to talk to me specifically I'll meet with them at their office or whatever. Rick

Can you talk to the appropriate commercial people and get them to decide?

What happened to savita

It is no probs

No surprize there 

Can you get me the Calger letter done?

Oh oh

Yes still need it -when are you back?

Where's Jeanie?

We will make that work for now.

Thanks

Good point - assume for now that we are running identical trading books as it should be easy to cut the ones we do not want. 

Obviously we shouldn't bother with bridgeline, peoples or anything like that.

Will that work?

Can you ask Wes to bring the proforma too (15 copies)

The meeting is to try and get portland back in line on timings - we clearly should not be in a position to trade physically immediately but within a month.  I am scared by his approach of 120 days for interconnection and 60 for FERC.

Please ask wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier

That may be the same for BR

Has anyone given any thought to the potential Enron NYSE delisting date relative to the date when the NETCo deal might be announced?

I think there might be some "spin" implications.

No - this is a serious problem

FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.  I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.

We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.

I'll be on the phone call  - let me know times/numbers	

Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend

One final new year's email: the netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.  Presto, belden, sager, nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 wednesday to discuss.  Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.

I copied this email list and copied Rita Wynne, Stacey White by mistake which obviously I shouldn't have done.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

No real choice - apparently there was an issue with visas so Jay told them they could say no.

Let's revisit Wednesday.

Louise,

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
11:00		Credit				Bradford
11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb
1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub

Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.

Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.

Thanks

Louise

Happy New Year by the way.

Louise- Any notion of amount of risk bidders are comfy with, both credit and market? I doubt anything specific has been discussed but have any ranges been thrown out. Hope all is well. Happy New Year. Rick

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster

+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Just when you thought it was safe............................

We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.

All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).

As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.

Thanks

 

Thank you for all coming in this morning - I think it went very well.   Particular thanks to those of you who were supposed to be on vacation.

Please could you all send a copy of your presentations to Tammie Schoppe.

Thanks again

Louise

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

We just need people to give us a week.  Surely they'll give us that long.
 
How are the new designs coming?
 
Did you and Avril have a nice Christmas - I am trying to reconnect my UK cell phone - I have been on the phone for 1 and half hours.

Jennifer doesn't know it yet, but when I submitted final numbers to HR, I kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases (which she did to balance the increases).
 
I expect we are going to lose some people. I hope the ones that go are not the best ones. Obviously, the more we are willing to spend in bonus, the fewer the people we will lose. 
 
When would you like to get together to discuss?
 
Dave
 
 

 
Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer 

Firstly, Dave is not responsible for the initial creation of these numbers which was done by Brad Richter before Dave joined the group.  I presume it was based on Brad's evaluations. 
 
I suggest we wait another week to see the structure of the transaction before moving numbers.

No attachment

John and Louise,
 
I have taken John's draft and added a few thoughts, including the issue of what happens if there is not a new agreement with counterparty (the Enron agreement remains in effect), the possibility that the new entity may not hire everyone, and the concept that they transfer to the new entity upon closing.
 
Let me know your thoughts.

Louise,

I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and eol.  Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.  They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc. There are approx 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.   We will have some good detail by jan 7.

Regards,

Chris

Just talked to Leslie Reeves about the meeting today.
 
Did I miss something?  Did we ever talk about a presentation

Maybe I missed something or it went to the other Bob Hall.
 
After the holidays, I would like to get in your calendar and

The meeting has been confirmed.

They told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.

Have I missed any critical group?

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Righ on Westlake Park and right again at the first entrance into the greyish
building complex (Westlake One)....go under breezeway and park in visitors'

Any news from Redmond?

Have thought of a way around this. - Find out as much as you can on why it happened and lets discuss.

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72	(cheque which bounced)
11/10/01	21,010:15	(never reached my account although showing paid)
11/10/01	3,319:40	(never reached my account although showing paid)

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.

 
Louise-
I'd like to talk to about my past and future efforts in NY in relation to NETCO.  I will give you a call today.

He will obviously be finally moving to Houston then - clever move!

I'm officially putting him in charge of costs (however, I'm a little afraid he might cut us).

So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats.

As I never used them - when do they get refunded - we then need to net off on expenses and reclaim the family ones.

This will slow us if we go this route.  I think the idea of an option to purchase is the best choice for us but probably difficult for you.

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

I have already registered several domaine names in the interest of getting up and running as soon as possible post sale of the business.  I have experience of delays as we have tried to retrieve domaine names where people have squatted intentionally in order to extract large sums of cash.  Should any of the buyers raise any issues - I do intend to use these for the purposes of our new business.		
I have a lot of them - spurious and real.

Tammie

They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.  You probably should pick up your tickets at an earlier time than the show as the queues are horrible  just before showtime. 
  Louise

Confirmation number: 96-16376

A printed version of this page, along with a photo ID and the credit card used to make this purchase must be presented to obtain your tickets.

Only the credit card holder may pick up tickets.  Third-party billing will not be accepted.

Tickets may be picked up at the Bellagio Ticket Office at your earliest convenience, but no later than one hour prior to showtime.  Otherwise, your reservation is subject to cancellation.

Ticket office hours are 9am to 11pm Friday through Tuesday; 9am to 9pm Wednesday and Thursday.

Theatre doors open one hour prior to showtime.  Please be seated 30 minutes prior to the performance.  Late arrivals will be seated at the proper

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.  

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.

Ooops sorry I forgot.  

David/Amy

Please send a list of names in Netco to Sally and Bob.  Please remove comp data.

Thanks

Louise

Can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  Bob Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and John on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  

Since I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both Bob Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so Bob will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.

Louise,

Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask:

A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like.

Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids?

Dave

 To be honest you guys need to continue organizing this as we have no idea what is going on in the creditors committee - I didn't even know they were here until Mark rang me.  You can have whichever resources you want although Berney is EES.  I would suggest you continue to lead the effort though.

The E&Y representatives (for the Creditors Committee) will be back in the office tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.  They want to continue to learn about how we conduct our business and may want to pay particular attention to how we value transactions in deciding termination amounts.  This has really gone beyond what the lawyers can effectively coordinate.  Bill Bradford suggested that Berney Aucoin might be a good resource for this process to assist Fallon and Miller since he really understands how we do deals from front to back and knows who all the right people are to speak to various issues.  If you agree, would you ask Berney to focus on this?  He can give me a call in the a.m.

Not quite sure where we ended up on this lot but clearly some of the below are Enron Europe's, so we do not need to bother with them.

After conversations with Kal Shah and Greg Piper, here is where we stand on the trade marks and domain names.
 
A.  Ownership of the following to be transferred to NewCo:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-comerce
2.  One stop energy shop
3.  Pricedesk
4.  Pricedesk.com
5.  Retaildesk
6.  Retaildesk.com
7.  Trading Innovation
 
Note that there are trademark applications pending for 2 and 7 above, and 3-6 above are registered by Enron Europe.  The Sellers will agree to convey whatever rights they have in marks 2-7 above to NewCo but cannot guarantee that NewCo will ultimately own the marks.
 
B.  EnronOnline:  Seller will grant NewCo a limited license to use the EnronOnline trade mark and logo for a period running 6 months from the date of closing solely for the purpose of marketing the new site as a platform for wholesale gas and power trading in North America.
 
C.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Seller will agree to redirect from EOL to NewCo for 60 days after NewCo site is up and running (with a link back to EOL at the NewCo site) and for 120 days thereafter will provide a link on the EOL site to the NewCo site.  
 
D.  Enbank:  Kal proposed that NewCo own this mark, but Greg would prefer that the Estate retain this mark.
 
I will leave it to Tim and Greg to discuss this proposal from their end and then contact Kal and/or Dave Forster to discuss.  After you all have reached resolution, I would appreciate if both Greg and Kal could contact Roger Ross of Weil Gotshall (713/546-5018 or roger.ross@weil.com <mailto:roger.ross@weil.com>) directly to confirm the final disposition of marks and names. 
 
Please let Roger know who should receive drafts of the License Agreements relating to B and C above.  
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.
 
Leslie 

Leslie -- I have spoken to Dave Forster and we would like to update our request  from yesterday as follows.  Pls. forward this to Nancy Raber as well.
 
The ownership of the following mark should be transferred to NewCo.:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-commerce:  Current Tagline for EnronOnline 

A one year usage license should be obtained for the following marks/domain names:
 
1.  EnronOnline:  Global Commodities Trading Platform

Nancy -- As per our conversation this evening, I am attaching the e-mail I had sent to Leslie Hansen.  I will contact Leslie  in the morning and determine what marks/domain names Enron will allow for inclusion in the deal.  I agree that if the new company is going to have a different name, it should be sufficient if Enron kept the EnronOnline marks/domain names, but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company.  I also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by Enron Europe given that it's a separate entity.  We will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks.  I will work with Leslie to research this tomorrow.
 
With regard to the "nice to have" trademarks in the second list below, I know that most of the domain names are owned by Enron Europe, not Enron Corp.  I will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them.  If the trademarks are owned by Enron Europe as well, we may forgo including them in the deal for now.
 
Please hold off any offers for trademarks/domain names your deal papers until I call to confirm our final position.  I plan to speak to Leslie and Dave Forster (head of EnronOnline) in the morning.  Thanks.

Sorry its all prepetition.

I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.  I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.  The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.    Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with Enron once payments have been completed on expense checks.

OK?

Ordinarily fine, however;

This was a pre-petition commitment by Enron and is not necessarily now a commitment of the estate
Presuming we get purchased, things should return to normal presuming the buyer honors all these commitment (that's how we have set it up).

David
As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.

I take it I do not need to do this?

What is John Casaucoumeq's title?

There is an open issue with respect to how the URL address will be positioned between the estate and NETCO.

Please call John Casaucoumeq (with whom I understand you will be speaking tomorrow at some time) (212 723 9661) and determine with him how this is to work.  Citi lawyer said however you and he work it out will be satisfactory as it is a business issue.  Please let Anne and I know.  Thanks.  Mary

finally read it - I thought it was pretty crappy.

I am spending all my days in credit.  Head above water but only just.

It never rains when it pours!

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.

Also just to confirm no GTC  changes on anything for the near future.

Thanks

Louise

Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara 

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

Not in the near future

Attachment shows where we ended up.  I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL. How does that hurt us?  It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too .
We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.

AEP sent us a very threatening letter.  Way outside of their contractual rights.

sorry missing the message

When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.

Payments and payment dates please.

Not good really for me as I was finally hoping to get paid this year

I am all over it

Is it bad?

Not in the near future

I would also like the same for EES wholesale.

It may be easy to do this by looking at the floor plans for the new buildings.

Please ring Lavo on 37991

What arr you up to with Vince

is Lisa doing ok on the LC wrap?

Nothing but good news everyday. Not sure I mentioned this: kerrigan's now running non-reg finance side at txu in dallas. We started talking about possibility of txu resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size). No word yet from legal on rolling el paso - ecp swaps back into ena and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting el paso.

Greg, Mark and I met with the Estate this morning and Canada did come up in terms of the Transistional Services agreement.  Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.  How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.  I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.

In terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.

Peter - tried to ring you. Give me a call when you are free.

The ECC estate has this morning proposed a frankly over-the-top list of human resource, systems, software and services requirements from UBSW Canada after closing.  Milnthorp and I have just had it out with Kyle Kitagawa and his counsel.  We will let you know.

Other items that need to be resolved for closing:

1.  Need to finalize Canadian Master Agreement - comments provided Saturday

2.  Need to finalize Canadian Transitional Services - see above

3.  Need to finalize Canadian office lease arrangements with landlords

4.  Need to finalize the list of FF&E to be kept by the estate

5.  Need to finalize the UBS AG counterparty/guarantee issue

Having spoken to Brian yesterday we need to redo his plan as most of his stuff is covered by reserves.

Louise:

Some guidance on how you want to handle the ongoing HPL costs/reserve management for next year.  Specifically, there will be a number of items that roll into next year that will have to be managed. I am going with the assumption that Jim will report into Wes and will be responsible for supporting this effort.  

Question:  Do you want me to assume: (i) that I have a seperate cost center for HPL and that has Jim's cost allocated to it, or (ii) should this whole effort just role up to Wes and then I can support it on an as needed basis? 

I'm open to either, but my recommendation is to keep some commercial oversight over the settlement of the outstanding HPL issues.  Because, if things start coming unglued, I'm sure I will get dragged back into it anyway.

Regards,
Brian

i didn't leave strong and stable.  I left a unstable but got loads of cash voicemail.

I am sure no one wants to provide another were strong and stable speech, but we have it on an extremely confidential basis that a memo is being drafted by their risk management group (remember the thorn in Bill's side and mine over the last years...) that recommends a ceasing of additional business with Enron and a review of their remedies under our agreements for significant changes in our financial capacities.  I have no idea how far Dick or Tom may let this go, but it is bad form...

Did you meet with Kim?

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

You may want to send a note to your commercial team to channel all new customer requests through Dave Forster and me.  I would like to be copied to make sure Dave has a clue as to what are real priorities.  Once we get up and running and the volume drops, I would be happy to coordinate this effort.

Bill

How much?

Louise,

Chip will want to talk with you about the Longview equipment.  We are circulating a DASH to enable us to continue making payments.  If we do not continue to make payments, we forfeit the equipment and take a $23MM hit.  This is approximately 35% of the total equipment contract.  I think the equipment is worth more (than 65%) and I believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a $22MM hit.  I therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ for this equipment.  It will continue to be funded off B/S.  

We continue to have discussions/negotiations with Calpine, NRG and TransAlta.  We have also opened up general equipment discussions with Mirant and AES.  

Regards,

Chris Calger

He has not talked to me. He cc'd me on an email this morning - to which I replied. I planned on conversing with him this morning, but the email beat me to the punch.  He has been working independently on this effort. 

I had a lengthy conversation with Trevor last night, spoke with Sherman this morning and also met with Karen.  I have made Brian very aware of Karen's efforts to clean up BHLP - I do not understand why Deanna Washington is involved with BHLP at allm

Keep working the deal - I left Tom a voicemail.  Now we have the cash you can work the deals at a b it slower pace - use your judgement.  I still want as much of that money as possible.

Thanks

We just haven't got time this week - I assume he will understand.

He was on your calendar for yesterday morning but you were unable to meet with him.  Should I reschedule this?  He asked to see John as well but John does not want to meet with him.

I really  do not think this a great week for me time wise - I'll try but I doubt I will manage it.

He's on the Executive Impact & Influence course on 6th & 7th November and Marcello being Marcello has been a bit tardy in selecting his raters (well, I actually ended up doing once he'd told me who to pick!).

The thing is because he's picked the minimum no. of raters it's important that those few give the feedback on him - yep you've guessed it, you're one of the few.

Apparently the feedback needs to be done by Tuesday so please may I ask you to do your best to give feedback on him.

Jenai-Kari will send the info as soon as we receive it from the estate.  Please place priority on the contract for Schields as we would like to have a fax as soon as possible on Thursday.  Call me on Thurs am if you still do not have what you need.  Thanks.

 << File: jes_new offers_changes_020602.xls >> 

I'm working it - do not worry

I had planned to call Per Dyrvik this morning (at Lou Eber's suggestion). Can I proceed? (Don't want to get in the middle of something you are working).

Dave

Working Ya (as Shankman would say).  It appears they will offer guarantees but I am awaiting confirmation.
Dave, as per previous discussions, I am very concerned with Canada not using UBS AG as the contracting party. Additionally, Lou Eber has confirmed with me a number of times that UBS AG does not guarantee subsiduaries but rather UBS is " good for it". This will not work. 

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

Dave

Delay it for a couple of weeks at least.

Louise,

As I am sure you are aware, our current plans on Fort Pierce include going back to FPUA and being honest with them (i.e. letting them know that the transaction as currently structured is not likely to proceed).  The goal of our meeting with FPUA is to be both fair and honest and to provide them with the opportunity to make the project more feasible by making economic concessions.  One concern that I have heard is that FPUA may incorrectly assume that our visit has little to do with the reason mentioned above and more to do with Enron's recent troubles.  Because FPUA is a municipal entity and this project has been closely followed by the media, this discussion is likely to make it into the newspapers and any conclusions reached by FPUA may be announced for all the world to see.  Do you have any suggestions for how this situation should be handled?  Should Eric Thode be consulted?

Stuart

Mike

I do not think these emails are helpful.  Pleae direct all questions to Chris Calger.

Thanks

Louise

Bob and Wayne,

It appears that our commercial group is discussing whether to suspend payments on the MHI engines claiming Force Majeure, basing this on the recent terrorist activity. Is this a path we want to follow, and is this supported by Enron management?

I'm quite concerned that this will only lead to more confusion, high legal costs, and difficulty with disposing of these assets, similar to the problems that have been created with the Westinghouse D5A.

If this is supported by upper management, I would like to know so I am prepared to deal with the results of the situation.

Thanks!

Mike

Left a voicemail for him.

Louise,

As discussed in the meeting, Kevin's contact details are as follows:

Work:	804.273.4848
Cell:	804.921.3726

Let me know when you've spoken with him so we can follow-up as needed.

- R

Seems like a great idea

Louise:

I unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as I was interviewing analyst candidates, however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and I applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone.

I realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore I felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation.  Since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital, I was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn Carl Tricoli's prepay concept for IPP's on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future.  Assuming we can find the right counterparties, then we in essence would achieve a short position (which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts) and pick up liquidity in the short run.

Regards,

Charlie

Yes please.  Let's discuss how we move forward in the morning

2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.

STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to "buy- speculative," from "buy-high risk", to reflect his concerns that "lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations." 
"This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked," he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution," said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 

Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
"It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO," Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
"We're always willing to sit down with a customer," Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
"To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away," he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
"That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing," Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
"We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers," Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. For more information about Kaplan Fox &

order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal
requirements.

              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=

Shares in Enron, the US energy group, fell again yesterday after Prudential=
 Securities issued a "sell" note on concerns that the $1.2bn loss taken by =
the company last week might not be the end of its bad news.=20
In the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading, Enron's stock was the=
 biggest percentage loser, dropping 20.2 per cent to $15.80 - its lowest le=
vel since August 1995. /
"We are concerned about what we don't know," said Carol Coale, the Prudenti=

She was disappointed that Enron had not been more forthcoming in the confer=

Investors have been abandoning the stock since October 16, when Enron told =
analysts it was taking a $1.2bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it=

Enron=20
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=
.2bn equity charge related to the closing of "related party transactions" w=
ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=
f disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlike=
ly to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for sha=
reholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief exe=
cutive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem=
 goes beyond one individual.=20

2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

None has shown yet. When it does come in, I'll let you know.

Canada appears to be an issue.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

Please let me know how we can progress on this.

Jay has been pulling reports over the last couple of days and so far so good.  Reported attached if you need it.

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

Please give me the ENA individuals then as surely the whole point of ibuyit is forthem to do it themselves.

Louise,

I believe what you are seeing is names of Enron Networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ENA. When this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for. Additionally all IT hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained. Therefore, some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver 1 and approver 2 columns will not be ENA employees. 

Please advise if you have any additional questions.

Thanks
John

There are a lot of people who are not Enron Americas - please cut them out?

That's ok - he always has done

Went VERY well.  Lots of positive vibes afterwards and goodwill towards both of you.  People most appreciated executives admitting to the fact that things were wrong and they were frustrated too, but everyone needs to get over it.  Big change from past history of blaming everyone but ourselves and just glossing over the real problems and making them sound better....

I can bring back probably $45-50mm on Friday, by switching to Paribas.  Maybe more, Shankman is working on his margin too.
On Peoples -I'll get back to you tomorrow.

Clarification:
(i) Broker Margins: How much margin do we think we can bring back via Paribas? The full $60mm?
(ii)  Peoples:  Can I sweep the $10mm to Enron and agree to put it back with a gty? Can we put the $40mm back to Peoples if necessary? What is the prepay - they possibly prepay us?    
Others I've got.

Thanks.

Joe
(i)	Broker Margins		
	Approx:	 $50mm
	Availability:	 End of Week
	Probability:	 85%
	Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.

(ii)	Peoples JV
	Approx:	$135mm
	Availability:	Within month

	We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.

(iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power).  
	Approx:	$25.5mm
	Availability:	Dependent on whether financing
	Probability:	50%
	If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.

fine

Louise - This is what I captured from our conversation and plan to send to the BoD unless I hear differently from you by tomorrow mid-morning.  THX a lot.  Paula

North American gas prices have increased recently, and power prices have followed.  The American Gas Association released storage numbers recently that appear low to our team.  Although these developments may create a difficult near-term environment, Enron Americas does not view the current strength in commodity prices to be sustainable.  
?	Enron Americas closed on the sale of 80%  [Kitchen, Louise]  of our  interest in a 240 MW power plant in Monterrey, Mexico, to Tractabel for approximately $40 million in cash and the assumption of all the related forward obligations by the buyer.

We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups.  

Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups.

Louise

LEt me know if you are planning any of these.

Louise, we have been pre-paying the positions to some of our customers. Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds).
However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.
Questions:  Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ?  If so, with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ?

Best regards. 

I spoke to Chris on this today, we are covering Foster but not going to do anything on the others at this time.

We can review in another month or so.

Louise,

Chris and I would like to provide additional equity to three members of our middle market team:  Chris Foster, Stewart Rosman, Paul Choi

As you know, compensation for Middle Marketers in Portland has become very competitive recently.  We lost Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs in Q3 to AEP simply because AEP was willing to pay a lot more.  Chris, Stewart, and Paul all signed two-year contracts at the end of 2000.  In short, they were unlucky enough to sign contracts at the worst possible time.  The market for their services, both inside Enron and outside of Enron has gone up.  The equity that they received as compensation for a non-compete is worthless.  In addition, they received no signing bonus.

Chris and I compared their contracts  to the ones that started getting rolled out in April and ones recently signed with people in similar positions in Portland.

				Title		Mid-Year Rank		Signing		Options		Stock

Mike Etringer		Dir	 	2			$40K		$75K		$0
Jim Gilbert			Dir		2			$50K		$100K		$0 
Chris Foster			VP		2			$0		$50k		$0
Stewart Rosman		Dir		2			$0		$50k		$0
Paul Choi			Dir		2			$0		$40k		$0

Here is our proposal for equity grants to our three key people in middle market / services.  This is just no strings attached equity because it's the right thing to do!  These guys are going to be key to our success 

			Restricted		Options
Foster		$50k			$75k
Choi		$50k			$75k
Rosman		$50k			$75k

Let us know your thoughts.

Working Ya (as Shankman would say).  It appears they will offer guarantees but I am awaiting confirmation.
Dave, as per previous discussions, I am very concerned with Canada not using UBS AG as the contracting party. Additionally, Lou Eber has confirmed with me a number of times that UBS AG does not guarantee subsiduaries but rather UBS is " good for it". This will not work. 

The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agreements and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

Dave

Does this still have capacity?  Can I put the West Desk's ERCs in this vehicle? How quickly?  How much capacity is left?
Respond when you can.

Sorry I completely forgot it was Wednesday

Thanks

I think they're behind us.

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

Forward to Tim Detmering

Tim,
How much money does Mariner have in the bank?
Please drop John and I an email.

Going out tonight

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John
				

I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

I know you'll do a great job -- you always do!

Is it me and not Lavo due to him maybe not attending

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

I think the job may still be open next year.

Louise,

I told John and Dave that I can not come to Houston this year.  I told them that the earliest I could start "commuting" is 1/15/02 with a move likely in March.

We are going to ask Kim's group to help pull information for credit (public domaine information) in order to help accelerate the credit process as his group is heavily stretched at the moment.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.

Is it me and not Lavo due to him maybe not attending

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Max Movers (713 680 8700) is coming to my house tomorrow at about 8:30 (first pick up of the day) to move the sofa to your house.  I suspect they will be there by 9ish.  Is that ok?

ok

Louise:

Here is how I would like to lay out TX responsibilities for a total of 8 people (all-in):

TX Gas Network Development - (HubCos/Transportation/Regulatory/Outsourcing): - Brian Redmond, 

TX Gas Fundamentals/Support - (Analyst, Admin Assistant)

Lets talk if this does not work for you.

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows the positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.

I can perfectly see which reports I have access to and which ones I do not.  So please explain why all I can't see Enron Americas Position Report for example.

Attached please find the list of reports that you have had access to.  On the home page each of these reports should be "blue" and any reports you do not have access to should be in "black".  Please let me know which reports not listed in the attachment you should have access to.

I apologize of any inconveniences.

with not being able to access our own reports - this is the second time I have asked.  Please open up the reports to me.  Or is there someone else I should be asking?

all

Louise,

I am working on refining the list and obtaining more detail. When you say "names", do you want names of companies, names of ENA reps or names of people at the companies?

Dave

Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.

We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.

Split the list into areas

Industrials in our SIC codes

Utilities

Munis

Thanks

Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

Dave

 << File: ees examples.xls >> 

Get the specifics we are organizing a meeting - need written examples - could you pleae co-ordinate a full list across gas and power.

Thanks

Examples of EES working in ENA territory seem to keep coming.

Anything further on this? 

Dave

too late

Here are the EOL slides
 
Hi Tammie,
 
Attached are the PowerPoint slides for Louise and John. Just let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

(713) 853-6218 

 

I think this is one for you Anne - can you help?
Louise --

I need to understand exactly what data is and what data is not being transferred from Enron to UBS.  If any of the data is viewed by FERC as being jurisdictional assets, than Enron would need to inform FERC of that transfer before the transfer.  Clearly, customer specific data will create more issues than generic market information.  I need to check what happens if you have deleted the counterparty names but still show detailed trading data.
 
Who can help me get a better handle on this on Monday?
 
Also, I understand the "adoption" by UBS of Enron contracts.  Initially I was under the impression that this was simply a "review".  Again, any transfer of a jurisdictional asset would result in a 203 application by Enron.  I have seen one draft of the Interim Agreement, but assume that you would do this for EEI and other physical contracts.  Am I right?
 
Thanks,
 
Jim
 

----Original Message-----
Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names.

The Master Agreement and License Agreement mention that you have "Customer Data".  Is this wrong?

Jim

Simply
 
People, systems and floor space.
 
Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters.

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

Jim 

 

venting

Thanks louise, I'm actually on this list. How was the MD meeting?

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven." 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult." 
Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching." 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com. 
If you are a member of the class described above, you may wish to join the action. You may move the court to serve as a lead plaintiff no later than December 21, 2001. 
If you would like a copy of the complaint, would like to discuss joining this action as a lead plaintiff, or would like to inform us that you are a member of the proposed class, please contact Thomas G. Shapiro, Esq. or Liz Hutton, paralegal, Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, 75 State Street, Boston, MA 02109, (800) 287-8119, fax at (617) 439-0134, or e-mail at cases@shulaw.com.

NEW YORK, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- An Enron (NYSE: ENE) shareholder has filed a derivative suit in Texas state court which charges that Enron's board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by allowing its CFO, Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. The Enron board lost the Company over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a clear conflict of interest for the Enron CFO. 
In addition to other transactions, the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the Company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars for himself and the limited partnerships. On October 16, 2001 the Company announced that it would take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships. It was also revealed that the Company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the Company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
On October 22, 2001, the Company announced that the SEC recently requested additional information regarding these limited partnerships.

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

Enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging SEC inquiry

10/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
"Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry." 
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us." 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades

10/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said. 
At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.
In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission. 
However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request. 
According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer. 
"This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community. 
"In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days. 
"However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said. 
In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. 
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest."
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document. 
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow. 
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter. 
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow. 
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements." 
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported. 
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday. 
Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. 
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

Hi Louise

Hope all is well and that your trip to and from London went smoothly!

A few questions:
1.	Does Enron have a system which collects data by customer?  We
have something called CMIS which we use for these purposes and which I
believe we will need to integrate into the infrastructure if you don't
have something already.  We usually need customer info for reg
reporting purposes.

2.	Bob Dinerstein believes it would be prudent to have a seminar of
sorts whereat the heads of Gas and Power Trading present to key UBSW
people what their businesses are all about, example trade flows,
competitive pressures, key reg reporting requirements, etc.  He would
also anticipate having our outside counsel participate to discuss what
they understand to be the developing regulations in these markets.  The
thought is to try and do this on Thursday because so many UBSW people
will be on the ground in Houston for the simulation exercise.  I don't
know that I am wedded to that day and I am a bit unsure about whether
this makes sense given it may interfere with progress on integration
but this day may work since alot of people will already be there and I
am sure the traders will not be interested in doing anything like this
once they start trading.  What do you think?

The audience would include key logistics personnel from UBSW and Enron
and anyone else you thought appropriate.  Spoke with Mike about it and
he is fine.

3.	Having UBSW paraphenalia sent down - toys, shirts, etc., should
be arriving by no later than Tuesday.  If you haven't received anything
by late on Monday could you let me know so I can track down.  UBSW and
UBSW Energy banners are being made to hang from the ceiling on both
trading floors - they should arrive by Wed.

4.	Was thinking perhaps we should have a celebration on the floor
on Friday to commemorate the closing.  What do you think?

5.	I am planning to be down in Houston for most of next week.  I
thought it would be helpful to be on site in order to be available to
address issues as they arise in order to meet closing on Friday.  I
will be leaving on a late Monday flight and returning on a late
afternoon Friday flight.  I hope you think this will be useful.  Please
let me know otherwise.

Sorry for the long message.  Please feel free to call me at home or on
my cell if you have any questions, issues, would like to discuss H 914
764 4597  C 917 523 6132.

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.

Don't tell me - did you tell his nibs - it's his issue

All the flowers on the gas floor were paid for by the assistants and were not expensed.  Ina Rangel, the gas trading floor coordinator, has verified and will ensure that no expenses are put through as she must approve them.  Let me know if you need further information.

We're getting them back believe it or not!!!

They are ours again.

So its ok.  We got the merchant business back a week, we don't even know who made that decision but its our again.

Louise,

Brett Wiggs is requesting approval for $300,000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the MHI turbines.  The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".

Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.

In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed here--an I-DASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.

Regards,

When people request an understanding of gas or power - does this mean you ask people from ENA to give tours or speak or something?  Is there any role we play in hosting the event?

Attached is a summary report of the EWS tactical (revenue driven) and strategic (educational) visits to Enron supported by experience ENRON in third quarter 2001.

At experience ENRON, our goal is to support the EWS deal development teams by creating powerful Enron experiences that result in greater favorability and familiarity of Enron while differentiating us from the competition.

Our role is to:
Reduce time and labor costs associated with planning and execution of customer visits
Coordinate BU subject matter experts (SME's) to tell the Enron story, i.e. EOL, trading, etc.
Customize agendas aligned with Enron and customer objectives
Shorten sales cycles 

We are here to support your team in reaching your goals.  Please call with questions or changes.

This one is searching through expoense reports.  I have no interest.  Can you guys do this for John please.

I know you will love looking into this one.

Can you check if all the gifts given out on the gas floor for boss's day were paid for by our employees or Enron.

That is awful.  Poor little kid.  Do they think it was just another child?

In case you hear - Wayne Mays' son had an anthrax scare (white powder in back pack).  Hazardous Materials unit and FBI went to the school.  Most certainly a hoax, but FBI suggested they may come to our office.  Although highly unlikely they come here, we alerted local building security and Enron Corp. security just so they are aware.

what a wonderful world...

Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  

A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.

Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.

As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.

As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.

Thanks

Louise
Here's a little issue.

We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?

Thanks

Louise:

It is my understanding that, notwithstanding the new vs. used election entered into iBuyit, IT deploys used prior to ordering new equipment.  It is also my understanding that this is especially the case for flat panels in light of the decision to outfit Enron Center South with new displays.

Louise,

Please send the referenced origination numbers to my attention instead of Scott Josey and direct any futurer correspondence/communication regarding supervision of ECR to me.

Thanks,
John

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.

We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.

Split the list into areas

Industrials in our SIC codes

Utilities

Munis

Thanks

Louise,

Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.

I think the attached substantiates two issues:

1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)

2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

Dave

 << File: ees examples.xls >> 

Get the specifics we are organizing a meeting - need written examples - could you pleae co-ordinate a full list across gas and power.

Examples of EES working in ENA territory seem to keep coming.

I've left him a msg that if his schedule permits he should plan on swinging by the office to chat briefly with dave and a few of his guys if it can be arranged. Sounds like he's making a social call btwn business calls but I want to discuss what other lp's are telling him about lack of activity and remind him our 1 year roll option is coming due soon.

Ok - I butt out.  EBS  only has a handful left now and with redundancies over there they are trying real hard to place their people.

Calling it an error is unfair.  I am not prepared to offer her AND her husband a job by Friday.  She concedes that her role on the power side may be project-like and therefore short-term.  I will keep in touch with her and open the door later.  London is being freaky about people finding homes ASAP, and it doesn't match my timeframe.

As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.

I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  

Thanks

Louise

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your budget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assuming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're putting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an answer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to Houston.

Brad

MAke sure we get at least 15% reduction.

No concerns. We managed to get about $40mm reduction the IT development budget, you are picking up some of the reduced budget (See Lloyd Will's email of earlier today).  Let Lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off.

He's 5 months, 19lbs and not rolling over!  90th percentile for weight, 50th height, 50th head circumference.

doesn't sound like it will be long before you have another one!
Don't worry about the Baby not turning over,  It took Katiana a while to turn over also as she is off the charts as far as size and length, it also took her a while to walk but she is doing fine now. How old is he now and how much does he weigh?  

Nadine is doing fine, she is working part time and seems to be happier - I am loving being a Daddy :)

As far as EBS, OH yeah, lots of nervous people... there is still however some more cleaning up work to do so I think I'll be OK.

Fine  - how are you?  Baby not turning over yet because he's big!!!

Lots of people falling out of EBS aren't there.

Forster is  running one of the power origination groups, give hime a ring.

Please let me know.

Looks like we are making outstanding progress.  This is great news.

Attached is a draft spreadsheet that captures the budget items reviewed with IT yesterday.

I have tried to correlate our description with their project name.  I have also created a starting budget and proposed budget for your review.  A % allocation row for east, west and cdn allocation has also been created for your review and comments.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.

Brian Redmond or Jean Mrha will need to approve the budget as your number will be charged directly to them.

Brian or Jean please co-ordinate your response through Faith Killen.

I'm trying to get approval for the portion of my 2002 budget that is currently allocated to EA.  Currently my budget estimates that 25% will be allocated to ENA for mainly the projects listed below in my original message to Geoff.  .  Another 25% is allocated to EES to cover my groups efforts in coordinating their move to Wholesale systems.  The remaining 50% stays within Networks to cover commercial deals like HPL etc.  Most of the ENA projects that I work on are in Brians world with a small part of my time spent on coordinating projects in Calgary and EDI projects for gas nominations.  Who do I need to discuss this with?  

Tommy Yanowski

Tommy,

I've been getting lots of email about IT budgets. My roll is to oversee the IT projects specifically for Gas Trading, particularly development projects.

I'm not sure your projects will directly affect gas trading and i dont know who to point you toward.

Sorry i cant help. Call me if you like

geof

Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:

		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline

In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  

Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.

If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales.

He shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this.

we only covered commercial.

Excellent.

On support side. My guess is that Colwell, Headicke, ENW (Beck/IT), Research, Tax, Comp. Analysis, PR and HR would prefer one meeting to do their areas rather than 6 for their people in each BU. Can we adjust for this?

Equally, what's your view on Global Finance?

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings.

Non Commercial but in North America:

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC.

Analysts and Associates

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria.

VP's

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay.

Cheers as you Brits say

great - two please

Hi Louise,

Hope you are having a very Happy Boss' Day. 
 How do you like this layout for the Fortune article?

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.  

Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.  Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub.

We decided to get Kristan Walsh an offer for fundies.  Can you get it to her when Jeanie gets it.

Thanks.

Nope

...knows. Eric didn't tell him. Did you mention it to him?

J

Its post earnings so no feeling on a day.

Spoke to him before his holiday - does not seem terribly happy?

Am glad you think the move is good as I want to get back into the core business. If you ever come back to run Europe at least I should know what is going on.

Am working on signing a contract again. Base aiint exciting but equity looks good. When would you set the strike?

M

I think its a good idea.

I thought a lot about it.

Spoken to Jonathan recently.

L,

Do you think I am making a mistake or do you just need time to think of the implications.

I'm up to $21.6MM.  I'll get changes to Faith.  I now feel more valuable!

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Thanks

I will get with Glisan to review Corp's allocations.

Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.  Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.

Did Howard attend - if so how's he looking?

It was a good service. Very sad. Jonathan's family is doing well I am told.

Thanks - I have used it already to Tim.  I mentioned the Beth concept - I'll let you know what he says.  Jeff Richter is too busy  - he runs EES in the West.  Keep thinking though I like the idea of Jeff or Barry.

Hi Louise,
 
Here is how I would word it:
 
Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES resposibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.
 
When I get to the big org announcement I'll have to add some more blurb in.....
 
I have a really good feeling about this combination. The way I want to take it forward is Steve, Anthony and I working closely on the strategy for EES and ENA.
 
On the subject of ENA IT Liaison, I had a discussion with Greg. We think that it would be better to have Beth completely out of the picture for the reasons I initially stated. An initial suggestion was that Jeff Richter might be a good fit, given his IT background and commercial understanding, although he'd have to move back from Portland. I think Barry Pearce would be great. Give me a few days and I'll see if I can come up with some other names, maybe someone from Europe ?
 
Best Regards

I think we are moving towards this concept.
Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte. 

On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.    I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.  If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.  Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.

On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.

Sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal.

Louise
It is a little bit funny and a little bit sad watching the technology group try to get buyoff from Louise and the business units on 2002 budgets.  It is unbelievable that we can't get a project-based capital and expense budget for next year where someone like me can say I signed up for these 5 projects and willing to do them at such and such a cost.  If the project costs more then I'm not interested.  While there is definitely room for improvement on the technology side, the commercial side has room for improvement as well.

We had a very useful EES Risk / Wholesale Risk technology meeting on Friday.  It was clear from that meeting that Commercial, Technology, and Operations are not on the same page.  East Wholesale and West Wholesale Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Commercial and ENA Commercial aren't on the same page.  EES Marketing and EES Risk may not be on the same page.  Anthony and Beth aren't on the same page.  Sally Beck's organization is organized wholesale vs retail while (at least on the power side) the commercial and technology groups are heading towards organized along commodity lines.  

For fear of sounding too dramatic ... the success of EES as well as wholesale Services deals is a function of our technology and back office.  Without it we fail.  The cost numbers are huge.  It is a critical point of competitive advantage.

It was amazing, we had a room full of talented people at this meeting on Friday;  I believe what was standing between us and a successful technology development effort was organization.  We are completely disorganized right now.  There are very few specs that are currently written to support next year's projects.  We have a completely inefficient, decentralized process for working through this stuff.

I have some thoughts that I'd like to share.  It cuts across wholesale and retail.  I think that we need a lead from commercial, technology, and operations for power (and probably gas).  I think the commercial person needs to drive the process and ultimately sign off on spending money for projects.  I think that we need one technologist in charge of all power systems.  I think that we need to look at everyone we have and choose the right person -- not necessarily the people who are currently leading this effort, although Anthony and Beth could be leading contenders.  We need Sally Beck to look at her organization and make sure that it is aligned for maximum likelihood of success.

The goal of this is not to micromanage each business unit's technology needs.  It is to coordinate and optimize across groups.  We have to make sure that we don't spend money in wholesale and retail and then develop incompatible systems.

How do you guys want to talk through this?

Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.  Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.

I am also meeting with Robert on your contract - so we should get that done today.

Thanks

Great news

We are talking to him.  I am having him talk with a number of commercial people.  He has little regulatory background and knowledge of key market issues.  That being said, he appears to me to be very bright and capable.  Will let you know how our discussions conclude.
 
Jim

is outstanding (I think anyway)- can we hire him? 

Maybe in Reg? 

Can't remember whether I thanked you for this - if not - thanks for your prompt response.

Nothing we need right now.  Things he may need to know:
1.  Pleased with our relationship so far.  Looking forward to market opening.
2.  We are discussing a number of other possible transactions with them including:
Possible options (either our call or their put) for power from the Bruce A units 3&4.  They are attempting to bring these back on line.  This deal would help them ensure the economic viability of doing the refurbishment.  I believe these would not come back until fall 2003 at the earliest.
Short term deals for early next year after market opening
Possible purchase of green power from their wind units at the Bruce

We are also trying to work more closely with them on the lobbying front for market opening.  This may be something he should try to sniff out to see whether they really care if the market opens early next year or not.  The people over here seem to be talking the talk that they do.

Cheers, Paul D

has a lunch tomorrow with the Chairman of British Energy.  Is there anything you want to get from that or should he just bluff his way through.

Let me know

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Jim,

There is a lot of confusion over the scope and scale of services that the estate will require from UBS over the next several months.  During the negotiations over the Transistion Services Agreement, it was clearly contemplated that the estate will need UBS to schedule and purchase power as an agent of the estate.  However, most of the UBS team does not understand or expect to provide these types of services.  I know that you have coordinated with Greg Whalley but I feel it is necessary that we have a broader coordination meeting between the two organizations.  I think this meeting needs to happen at your level.

Thanks,

Paul

Pretty much correct.  Actual is:

Curry	$20,439,468
Sukaly	$0 (somehow 4 midmarketing deals I did got credited to Sukaly so I moved the $27,602 to me!)
Ahn	$12,181 (associate)
Jester	$10,000 (just started in group a couple of months ago)

Doug Gilbert-Smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50% of its value $18MM.  No one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups.  Portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with Enron Wind.  Edith Cross and Greg Trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved.

Thanks, - Mike

Cris

Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.

We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. 

Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

I do not think it is possible to begin selling the ATS Warrants at this time.

Per the ATS Warrant Certificate, the ATS Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants may not be sold, transferred or otherwise traded until March 20,2002.  The Warrants are also non-transferable except to an affiliate. 

In addition, the ATS Warrants are valued daily using a Black-Scholes model.  The spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached.  The current value of the Warrants is $762,600 USD using the evaluation model.  However, the current ATS stock price on the Canadian Venture Exchange is $0.97C with an Warrant exercise price of $0.85C for the first 2,000,000 share tranche. The second 1,000,000 share tranche has an exercise price of $1.10C.  Thus, the current value is considerably less than the Black-Scholes evaluation model is calculating.  

 

If you have any questions please give me a call at extension 33541.

Kevin Miller

 

Progress to Date:

- Karen Buckley back in charge
- All Origination VP's contacted, met and supportive of concept.
- All dept. heads who would host a rotation have been contacted and are supportive.
- Waiting for first draft of manual (should have an ETA shortly)
- Initial list of candidates for interview identified

Actions to be Completed:

- Completion of manual
- Contact potential candidates and commence interview process.

Hey Dave, can I have an update on originator track.

No to both. Let's discuss.

I will 
Thanks

Have you done any deals yet?

As I want to go to the Cantor memorial service.

Louise

Thanks for your work on this.

I can't wait for the UBS discussion on WSPP!!!!!

Attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading GTCs for physical power which I have generally discussed with Bryan Murtagh (UBS). You will note that we have elected to use the EEI form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players, eg WSPP.

I will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by Monday am.  If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.  

By copy of this email to Genia, I would ask for her help in cleaning up the document (sorry, beyond my current skills, hopefully, soon to be broadened) and would ask Leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts/comments.  Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation.

Can you resend me the doyle email from last week

Yes - good guy.  I think he is moving with Marcello into their new cross commodity group.  But he's bright, agressive and worth trying to get.

Do you know this gentleman.   Suarez is high on him.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.

hi 

I don't have any - Jay Fitzgerald managed all of that for me and we closed the group down last year.

Sorry

Louise

Hi Louise,
 
it was good talking to you on my last day at Enron.  A couple of weeks have since past and I am now in Houston on a visitors visa.  Now I can focus on DealBench. I am currently spending 100% of my time searching  for funding of the venture. As you pointed out this solution would really be an  attractive one for both sides. 
 
The VC community is still under shock with the drop  in the NASDAQ and making contacts is best done through referrals. Do you know  anybody that is well connected in the VC community. I would be glad to meet with  that person and brief him on the venture and get going with the local Houston  venture firms.
 
Let me know if you have any other ideas that could  help the process.
 
Take care.
 
Tobias

Ok I thought it was in Washington state.

The only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that 

(i) They are not from this quarter 
(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.
(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.
(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.

I have included front portion, Americas and Europe sections.

The only data point I am lacking at this point relates to our East Power slide regarding #  of Term MW's.  I am working with Leslie Reeves on obtaining this information.  I expect the wording on the RTO's slide may change a bit once Gov. Affairs provides their final comments; however, this draft includes most of the content.

Following our discussion this morning, you may have some comments on Slide 14 (Recent Structured Transactions).  This slide was modeled after your Board presentation.  We can add/delete information as you desire.  

I am working on modifying the conference call script language and will forward to you shortly.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards.

Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. 
Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. 
Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.

Tata in talks to buy Enron's Dabhol power plant - FT

TOKYO (AFX-ASIA) - Tata has held exploratory talks to buy Enron's power plant in Dabhol, India, the Financial Times reported. 
Tata Power has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, though any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project, the newspaper said.
It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar, it said. 
Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. 
Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. 
About 70 pct of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing 1.4 bln usd and foreign lenders the balance. 
Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant's sole client.

Qatar, Dolphin to sign final mega gas deal "shortly"

10/14/2001
Agence France-Presse

ABU DHABI, Oct 14 (AFP) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for a multi- billion-dollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad "shortly", the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) said Sunday. 
"The development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) with Qatar Petroleum (QP) is due to be signed shortly," UOG said in a statement.
The state-run UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project. 
"Over the coming weeks, the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December. One of them is scheduled to be selected in early 2002," UOG said. 
UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors -- Conoco, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States, BP International and the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell -- to replace the US firm Enron Corp., which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its 24.5 percent stake to UOG. 
Enron's role was to build a 350-kilometre (220-mile) pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. 
The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and eventually Pakistan. 
In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to 10 billion dollars, the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast. 
The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted. 
The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline. The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars.

NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE'S FUTURE > NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS
Antonio Fins Business Writer

1H
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals, natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida's energy grid. 
The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade, natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities, up from about 18 percent now. Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida.
As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida's coast, other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas. 
Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area. Enron Corp. of Houston is proposing to spend as much as $400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades. 
Enron's proposal is drawing rivals. El Paso Corp., also in Houston, wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach. And AES Corp. has purchased Ocean Cay, a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades. 
The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups. Ultimately, federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed. 
Still, electric companies, which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010, are looking to make heavy use of natural gas. 
"Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas," said Michael Haff, an engineer at the PSC. "That's the reason for the large increase" in projections of natural gas usage. 
All this is quite a change for Florida's electric utilities. For decades, power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida's power plants than to pipe in natural gas. 
Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida. Most users are small factories, public laundries and restaurants, where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it's easier to control the heat. With little need for heating homes in winter, residential use has generally been limited to barbecues, water heaters and stoves. 
Consequently, Florida uses far less natural gas than many states. Household use of natural gas is less than one-fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use. 
The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors. The federal Clean Air act, signed into law in 1990, is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators. 
Natural gas is one of those options. 
Alvaro Linero, the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said natural gas emits no particulate matter, the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions. Unlike oil or coal, it gives off no sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions, a key component of smog, when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal. 
Florida Power & Light Co., the largest of the electric companies, has already heavily invested in natural gas generators -- 21 of its 29 non-nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas. 
FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money, but the utility, regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch. 
Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability. By 2005, natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline, which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico, is finished. Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline projects as well. 
Still, some environmental groups say that, while they want cleaner energy, they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears. 
One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks. Enron, which applied to build a Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline, said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe. But Broward officials and a conservationist group, Hollywood-based Save Our Shores, have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins. 
The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently. After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad, N.M., last year, killing 12 people, the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing. 
And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates. 
They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters, stoves and even gas-run air conditioning units -- a more efficient and cost-effective use of natural gas than running electric generators, they argue. 
But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re-landscaping, so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic. 
Disagreements aside, the consensus is that the state's power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option. 
"We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase," said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. "At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before."

Debt load smothers Polaroid; Bankruptcy filing pointing to sale, firings
GREG GATLIN

Boston Herald

(Copyright 2001)

Polaroid Corp., one of Massachusetts' most-storied innovators, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company. 
The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64- year-old Cambridge instant-photography legend.
The company that helped define Route 128 as America's Technology Highway, slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978, when it employed nearly 21,000. 
It has local operations in Bedford, Cambridge, New Bedford, Norton, Norwood, Waltham and Wayland. 
Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5,500. Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. 
It's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. 
"How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand," said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. "A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized." 
Polaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it "accelerates and intensifies" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. 
But it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. 
That includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. 
Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. "I think everything's on the table," he said. 
Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. 
A federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. 
In its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. 
As expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. 
Crushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. 
Its once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. 
Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. 
A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. 
As legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. 
By 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover.

Enron wins court injunction 
Enron, which is poised to pull out of the largest foreign direct investment in India, has won an injunction from a court in London preventing the regional government of Maharashtra from challenging arbitration proceedings launched by the US power company.
Enron's opponents say the court decision, which is confined to appeals in India, significantly reduces legal defences for Maharashtra, where the 2,184MW power plant is located, and is likely to raise the stakes in the Houston-based company's increasingly messy attempt to withdraw from India with full compensation. 
Officials at Enron's Indian arm, Dabhol Power, say the legal move was designed to prevent Maharashtra from trying to stall arbitration through endless legal obstacles. This is what has happened between Enron and its sole Indian client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Khozem Merchant, Bombay.

Qatar, Dolphin to sign final mega gas deal "shortly"

ABU DHABI, Oct 14 (AFP) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for a multi- billion-dollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad "shortly", the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) said Sunday. 
"The development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) with Qatar Petroleum (QP) is due to be signed shortly," UOG said in a statement.

"We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase," said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. "At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before."

Debt load smothers Polaroid; Bankruptcy filing pointing to sale, firings
GREG GATLIN

Polaroid Corp., one of Massachusetts' most-storied innovators, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company. 
The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64- year-old Cambridge instant-photography legend.
The company that helped define Route 128 as America's Technology Highway, slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978, when it employed nearly 21,000. 
It has local operations in Bedford, Cambridge, New Bedford, Norton, Norwood, Waltham and Wayland. 
Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5,500. Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. 
It's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. 
"How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand," said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. "A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized." 
Polaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it "accelerates and intensifies" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. 
But it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. 
That includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. 
Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. "I think everything's on the table," he said. 
Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. 
A federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. 
In its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. 
As expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. 
Crushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. 
Its once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. 
Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. 
A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. 
As legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. 
By 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover.

Enron wins court injunction 
Enron, which is poised to pull out of the largest foreign direct investment in India, has won an injunction from a court in London preventing the regional government of Maharashtra from challenging arbitration proceedings launched by the US power company.
Enron's opponents say the court decision, which is confined to appeals in India, significantly reduces legal defences for Maharashtra, where the 2,184MW power plant is located, and is likely to raise the stakes in the Houston-based company's increasingly messy attempt to withdraw from India with full compensation. 
Officials at Enron's Indian arm, Dabhol Power, say the legal move was designed to prevent Maharashtra from trying to stall arbitration through endless legal obstacles. This is what has happened between Enron and its sole Indian client, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Khozem Merchant, Bombay.

I'm fine.  Still laughing about co-president!

Louise, just not to leave this item pending.  You asked me to talk to Steve and think about a differen ttitle...After hours of deliberation, I propose to you that we keep the regular US title  (Director), and we avoid any confusion. In terms of our customers I'll just tell them I am director for the Monterrey office.
Let me know if you are OK so I can immediately correct my business cards. 
Thanks and have agood weekend. 

Fine

Louise:

In our meeting this week, I forgot to mention that we need to move the accounting responsibility for Onondaga from the gas group over to Chris Sherman and Billy Fleenor. Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If you're ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.

Thanks and regards,

yes to this i discussed with don
The following reports have been waiting for your approval for more than 4 days.  Please review.

Report Name: Management Offsite
Days In Mgr. Queue: 5

Owner: Jean M Mrha
Report Name: J. Mrha 10/8/01
Days In Mgr. Queue: 5

Jean is still pushing to run wellhead desk, she may come and see you.  I have pushed back stating that we are much better placed to evaluate her outsourcing business as it is and that we will review this when we have seen sime dealflow.

Louise,

I think what I really wanted to convey is the following:

1. John Grass originally headed up the Wellhead desk and Outsourcing efforts for the producer segment.  I wanted him to do that because of the logistics overlap between purchasing wellhead gas and offering outsourcing services.

2. When the volume of the Wellhead desk started to increase and based on my frustation with the lack of "contract focus" with Ocean Energy, Andex, and other producer outsourcing deals being pursued, I asked Kevin Miller to manage Producer Outsourcing and John Grass to manage only the Wellhead desk.

3. Based on Kevin Miller's memo (attached below), the Wellhead desk reporting into Hunter, I have been questioning the value of a separate outsourcing effort independent of the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha
Jean, 

Per your request, attached herewith is the rather lengthy Producer One Update/

 

Thanks ... Kevin

I wouldn't mind seeing your sofa if you still have it.  If you give me a time, I'll pop over.

Thanks

Louise

Stop working weekends again
See you tomorrow

Can you redraft in light of how I redrafted the other one - removing Enron's name from the first paragraph.  And resend to me

Thanks

Louise -- Could you review and approve the attached draft of the cover letter for the direct mail pack?  The letter will be sent under your name.  I will come by tomorrow to get your signature on a piece of paper.  We will scan it and print on the letter electronically.  

Thanks

That works.

how bout this one.

With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.
 
I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.
 
Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list.
 
 
 
 

my order is actually future p\l based.  if it wasn't in enron n.a. i would put calger way higher.  ie - if it was pulp and paper and i knew that we wouldn't have the opportunity to trade size, chris would be in the top 3.  Maybe 1.  But in this market we need to have the people who can make over 100 MM every year.  just thinking.

I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Our differences are:
Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster
You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin
 
I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.
 
Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey? 
 
I added to your file schoolyard.
 
Speak to you later.

Paul received the standard business reorg package as a consequence of the storage group under Jean Mrha being dissolved.   Based on his service and salary, Paul will receive 59,232.92 (assuming he signs a waiver and release)

Additionally, Scott Hendrickson, after 30 days of looking for a position (requested by Lavo), will receive 32,691.38 (assuming he signs a separation agreement).  He was terminated for performance.

If anyone ever gets from us a leaving package I or John want to know about it.

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Are you unwinding it?

Here's my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps:

As I indicated earlier, the original $32mm was put on for the Linden 6 expansion which never occurred.
The second swap of $350mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from El Paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly. This hedge does appear to have been set with the El Paso payment stream in mind.
The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer.
However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.

It appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time, a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the "dirty" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time.
Given that the monetization never occurred, it does appear to me that the $32mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note.

Anyone have anything additional to add? That's the best I could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures.

ARe you in the office?

As per my email from yesterday;
 
Attached are Pipeline companies, Transmission Company (Ercot) and Canadian companies not on the prior "Louise Approved" list which credit has been working on.
 
We have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies, and for AEC storage, there are two names - I assume only one may be required. For any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today, we have included the group name. We will resolve the remaining full legal names on Monday morning, when other staff are available.
 
Dave
 
 
 
 
 
 

I agree - thanks for this. it will have slow death......................................

Louise,

I only spent an hour on this.  However, I would pass.  This would keep a lot of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces.  

This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to be good developers, acquirers, etc.  They even say that they that restructured 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense - further reduces our restructuring proposition.  

To me, the QF optionality goes like this:  
- If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market is low.  
- If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion.

Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me
...and we are bearish on development

At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.  Besides, I think someone will pay more for it.  Over half the net MW is new 7FA capacity - attractive to Calpine and the Calpine wanabees.   This is actually a cheap way for an IPP to hit its MW growth targets without blowing their brains out in the spot market.  

Someone should pay up - not us.   

Question: Did we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success of East Coast Power?  Was that success largely driven by the fact that we bought it cheap?  Or did we innovatively restructure the PPA?  If we brought innovative financing to the deal, isn't that the same as buying it cheap?  Was East Coast Power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deal? 

I can dig into this some more if you'd like.  Our internal model would be my next step.  Let me know.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Is that what ECR want to do with it?

Our efforts to sell Pluto/MEGS to Duke

I met with Stephen Noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the Pluto Gathering line.  As per our internal meeting on Wednesday, I questioned Stephen about Duke's evaluation based upon the data provided thus far.  Enron has provided Duke with the Gathering Agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream.  I informed Stephen that Enron would like to know a notional type value for the Pluto gathering  line.  We both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream.

Stephen informed me that Duke's evaluation to date showed a value in the $14 to 15 MM range.  Stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation.  However, based upon the notional value Duke has derived,  it appears that Duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor Enron is using.  I stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value.

Based upon this discussion with Duke, I would recommend that we proceed with setting up a Mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get Marathon approval for release of the Production Handing Agreement (PHA). I will contact Richard Clark regarding the PHA.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext. 33541.

Thanks  ... Kevin

well done I think even I would have given up before now

It is looking like we have a deal with Marcello that has him reporting into me and John so that will be a great result , we now need to get him signed to a new contract . 
Speak to you soon .
Michael

About time

Wahey on runway

In chicago I'm fine with that see you monday

I hope you went of course not

On the people - we are planning for a group to start Mopnday pm as it is not as urgent as teh credit wording for this Monday.  Let me know if I can help.

Dave,

The download from EOL contract database is not the Day 1 contract list we will be using.  Disregard the Contract/Name Type column in your attachment.  There are only six initial contract types.  Master Gas, Master Power, ISDA and corresponding GTCs.  Also, we will adjust the initial contract requests by Credit Approvals.  We need to be consistent in what we are communicating to UBS and internally.

Thanks,
Bill

Attached is a list of company legal names, with Enron contract types identified, which some of the recipients of this email have requested.

The GROUPS represented on this list roughly correspond to the groups on the various lists in circulation and should be relevant for relaunch.

The list I sent out earlier today contained some company names which had been identified by commercial groups as Top 50, but in fact will not be trading on day 1 as they do not trade the products which we are planning to launch on day 1.

Accordingly, we will send out a new list tomorrow morning, which will contain:

- Names of pipelines or transmission companies needed for day 1
- Names of Canadian companies needed for day 1

The revised list will show only those names incremental to the "Louise approved" list currently being used by credit and will contain the full legal name of the relevant entities.

To avoid any confusion, I suggest you delete the last list I sent you and use the "Louise approved" list along with tomorrow's list.

If anyone has any questions, please contact me on:

office: 713 853 1861

Dave

 I thought you needed him to carry two people.

Tammie please forward to Duran
I spoke with Wayne Mays - he spoke with Coleman and Virgo and confirmed my understanding:  Wayne's RC has the following people:

Portland:
Bill Williams - Development
Mark Mullen - Development
Larry Soderquist - Transmission
Stan Gray - Transmission
Don Hamond - Transmission
Jodi Blackburn - Contracts
Patty Deas - Admin

Houston:
Walter Koffer - Transmission

Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because:
- the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
- West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-year. 

This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski already left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.

See you in Enron House when I get back.  I am sure you'll be back working in EEL before me.  

Happy travelling.

Sorry missed this earlier - I'm in Chicago.  Comments on BE - probably too late .  Sorry

Nothing we need right now.  Things he may need to know:
1.  Pleased with our relationship so far.  Looking forward to market opening.
2.  We are discussing a number of other possible transactions with them including:
Possible options (either our call or their put) for power from the Bruce A units 3&4.  They are attempting to bring these back on line.  This deal would help them ensure the economic viability of doing the refurbishment.  I believe these would not come back until fall 2003 at the earliest.
Short term deals for early next year after market opening
Possible purchase of green power from their wind units at the Bruce

We are also trying to work more closely with them on the lobbying front for market opening.  This may be something he should try to sniff out to see whether they really care if the market opens early next year or not.  The people over here seem to be talking the talk that they do.

Cheers, Paul D

BNY - times change eh

Given recent events, we are looking to cover our long protection ($15mm) in Edison Mission Energy.  Will keep the position if you are still interested or can sell it to ENA.  Bonds have rallied in, still looking for a market in the Default Swaps.  Pls. let me know if you have any interest.

Could you confirm that you are covering our non-Houston based offices inclu=
ding but not limited to Portland, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, New York.

Thanks

Louise

We need to create added measures in Chicago, especially with the wood doors=
.  We may want to require all non-badge entries be made on the other side. =
 Additionally, we need to keep some record of all visitors, their purpose, =
etc.

We can chat on this tonight, but please come up with some recommendations c=
onsistent with the attached.

Thanx,

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09

Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

has a lunch tomorrow with the Chairman of British Energy.  Is there anything you want to get from that or should he just bluff his way through.

Let me know

Currently interviewing a guy from Pacificorp - fingers crossed.  Keep it quiet though.

Those guys will do the full horizontals too wherever possible - I'll do the others

Louise,

I've seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent NA interests, and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets.

However, there are a number of horizontal initiatives, such as Global Data, that cut across all of them.

Is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed, or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers?

regards

Steve

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

I don't think so
Louise:
 
We completed an assessment and found that the variable operating costs were not as competitive as other alternatives in the marketplace.
 
George

George,
 
We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?
 
Louise

Greg:
 
As you know, we have used DealBench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for Enron to sustain.  I would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize GSS to contract and manage a third party service/auction platform for Corp. and the commercial business units.
 
George
 
As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

I'd like to get on your calendar in the next couple of days to discuss a couple of items. Are you OK with me scheduling something with Tammy? I'll only need 45 minutes or so. 

Thanks,

OK - I'll be there

Louise, I think that Laura has already passed this along but I do not want to assume anything.  Chuck Davario is leaving on vacation Wednesday of this week.  We have tentatively scheduled a meeting that would include you, the latter part of the week of October 22.  Probably on the 24th, 25th or 26th.  I know that this will need to be coordinated with your meeting with Peoples. 

In the interim, I have met with ENA Power/Asset management. We are preparing a list identifying every KeySpan activity and responsible representative.  ALL activity WILL be coordinated through me and will be focused to support this transaction.  I am attempting to schedule a meeting this week with Ed Anderson ( KeySpan, works for Chuck ) to complete an earlier Settlement negotiation.  We will continue to hold conversations with others at KeySpan during Chuck's vacation to keep all of the initiatives moving forward.  I will keep you posted.

Louise -

We've negotiated an MOU with Alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for CFB based power plants.  It does not commit us to spend any money today; it's really just a strong guideline for what the EPC will look like.

Having said that, Alstom considers it a BIG deal, and they are flying in some heavies from Paris for the signing ceremony.  The guy below is the lead person from Paris.  Additionally, Fritz Gautschi, Alstom's Country President will be coming.

Bottom line:  It's tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 October here in Houston.  If you and Dave are available, I'll coordinate.  You won't need to sign, just provide some presence.  There's still some flexibility if that day doesn't work for you.

Thanks,

Mitch

You need to kick some butt here

The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.  

Paul:

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively "a cost of capital" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Regards,
Brian 

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

Paul:

Please confirm that ENA will not bear any insurance costs for the HPL assets for the second half of 2001 and the balance of years going forward?  If this is not the case, then we need to meet and discuss why this is not the case.

Thanks,
Brian

Paul
In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.  

Jackie
Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

Jim:
As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets. 

Regards,

Jim:
Please update accordingly.

So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.

I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress.

Can you tell me if you have made any progress re: resource allocation for Bill Bradford's Credit Group to process deal flow in the West?  I had mentioned to individuals in the Middle Market Group that you were "on it" and if there is a follow up I can give them I would like to do so.

Thanks!

MGU and Utilicorp are meeting via conference call Tuesday morning on the recommended structure.  We have appropriately scripted MGU on the merits and need for immediate closure to hit the November 1 start.

I will keep you posted.

ATS is not new origination and shows through the MPR.  All the rest were too small.

Louise

Why?

Per Chris Sherman's and Louise Kitchen's meeting, only Blowfish, NICOR, and Unocal should be on the Hotlist.  Kinder Morgan, Seabreeze II, and Oakhill have been removed for the 4th Quarter 2001.

Please see the revised Hotlist for 10/03/01.

great news

Is in!

Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.

In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way.

FYI not a big deal, but thought you should know.
Gray Calvert - works in SF
We like him
Calpine offering him a little more money
I think I have sold him on staying

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.

Thanks

Louise

Not prizes for that title.
Today's issue of e-Biz has the following article in "Short Cuts"...

The 'Kitchen' is Hot
Fortune has ranked Louise Kitchen the 17th most powerful woman in corporate America. Louise, COO of Enron Americas, was recognized as the driving force behind EnronOnline, "begging, borrowing and stealing smart people" to get the commodity trading web site off the ground. In compiling the annual list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, Fortune considered the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go -- and the influence she has on mass culture and society.
Topping the list are No. 1, Carly Fiorina, chairman & CEO of Hewlett-Packard; No. 2, Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay; and No. 3, Oprah Winfrey, talk show host and chairman of Harpo Entertainment Group. The list appears in the Oct. 15 issue of Fortune.

We have just been informed that the FTC has granted early termination
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period for the purchase of Enron's gas
and power business.

George,
 
We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?
 
Louise

Greg:
 
As you know, we have used DealBench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results.  Unfortunately, the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for Enron to sustain.  I would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize GSS to contract and manage a third party service/auction platform for Corp. and the commercial business units.
 
George
 
As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

I do need to alter one slide and also I am keen to see the financial slide whenever it is done.
 
Hope you had a good week-end.

Louise - Thanks.  It looks very good.  I made a few minor changes this evening to add "units of measure" to 1-2 slides ($ in millions).  Also, will increase the size of fonts on the US map/structuring slides so the group will be sure to see them.  Terry and Steve now have the "Master" and will shoot it back to you on Monday, probably around mid-morning so you will know of these minor changes, each intended to enhance visibility without changing any content.  Terry will be in touch, or you can reach her at ext. 36910 if necessary.  Again, thanks.  'Have a great weekend.  Paula
 
Terry - Please be sure Wes sees the Financial Highlights chart from Butts.  THX

We are awaiting the financial numbers slide from Bob Butts.

When is it - I can't miss that if its the budget meeting?  It appears to be every day.

I am a bit worried now about next week - I appear to have some real scheduling difficulties.

When is it as Marcus is away on Thursday - I presume Chicago is Wed and obviously I can't do Philadephia as Marcus is away.  I presume you know all this - am I looking at the wrong week - is Chicago next week?

Could you put together  a list of all the Enron Corp employees who have Enron (non-Dell) equipment at home.

You have two problems

(i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm)
(ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap. (approximately ($9mm) is not offset)

Louise

yes, we took $1.3M for the Nymex swap against this

Did we take the money against this from the nymex swap?

I am getting zeros from everyone else on DealBench.  Have not heard from EES or EBS yet.

Pickering says you have a sheet showing 610 on IT last year (I assume expense and capital).  Mark says he is getting it from you tomorrow so I look forward to sitting down with him and seeing that vs. our estimated 720 for all of ENW in 2002, which includes all operations as well. 

I explained the complete expense and capital numbers across all the business units to Wes this morning.

I assume we are coming back to you next week on the EA systems project list, the actual headcount on IT and an answer on our indirects.  I will make sure.

Piper

We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.  We will not agree to an allocation though.

I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way. 

I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise.

We haven't use the standard formula's here for several years.

John

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year.

OK

Your favorite subject!!!

Tammie just informed my assistant that the space where the plotter is slotted to be cannot be turned into a people spot because there is a big pole in the way.  So, I am back to needing one more space.

Let me know what can be done.

Thanks,

Like to me with you today.

FYI - I would like to meet with both of you to discuss same (preferably after the 10/8 meeting).  Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks againg for sharing your thoughts and opinions in our 10/3 meeting.  In an effort to make our 10/8 meeting as productive as possible, I have put together an agenda (attached) for the Monday afternoon meeting.  It would be most helpful if you could review the agenda prior to the meeting and come ready to discuss your thoughts related to the discussion items.  If the discussion items do not address your primary issues, please let me know so I can either modify the agenda or include it in the next meeting.  If you have any questions, plese ask.

Duran has to okay it

I had a call about getting a new one in Baughmans team. Sounds like he needs a assistant come specialist. He knows someone at EES. I've told him to have some conversations and see if she's interested.

Are you vetoing all new assistants/clerk into ENA?

I think we should be selective.

David

At least she will not keep quiet.

Can she go toe-to-toe with the likes of Presto and Arnold?

Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names.

The Master Agreement and License Agreement mention that you have "Customer Data".  Is this wrong?

Jim

Simply
 
People, systems and floor space.
 
Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters.

How would you describe (in terms that a regulator would understand) what is transfered to UBS?  I am asking because I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what is going to UBS before our FERC pre-meeting.

My understanding is that we are providing software code to is used (a) for all backoffice applications and (b) for a trading platform.  Anything else?

we are compiling the YTD numbers and will have to you shortly

 
 

We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  

As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow.

If you want more details - let us know.

Sorry, I think my fault.  I have spoken w/ Wes and Georganne to pull back out and need to get Mike to redo contracts to be dated in 4Q to survive any potential Arthur Andersen review.

I really want it in Q4 - not Q3

 Booked in 3Q, 3.5 to origination, 3.5 to trading

is speaking to Mike McConnell today

Where are we with www.enrononline.com?

Louise,

1) I just received a call from Pat O'Donnell asking us to hold off on marketing to the Top 50 customers until he is able to address an email he just received from UBS corporate marketing folks, instructing us not to use the url: www.ubswenergy.com. It seems they want us to use www.ubswarburg.com/energy. Pat is going to argue on behalf of ubswenergy.com tomorrow. He anticipates having resolution by noon. I personally don't care much what URL we use: the brand name and achieving concensus to get this off the ground is more important. Of course, a change in URL now means we have to go back through the site and change all the references again. . .

2) UBS (in the form of Matt Meinel, who feels Mike Hutchins will be in agreement with him) do not want us to redirect traffic from www.enrononline.com to the new site, as they feel that promotes too much of an association with Enron. I disagree with their position, but don't think this is too big a deal - we will just need to more heavily promote the new website name. Also, the execution version of the contract apparantly dropped the redirect requirement.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the above and how you want to proceed. We are ready to put the Splash page out and start marketing as of noon tomorrow, but these 11th hour changes are making me feel skittish about pulling the trigger and I feel a real lack of comfort about our ability to market a system with no name.

Dave

No fine thanks

Louise,

The website in question has been cleaned up and the people at Premier Home Rental apologized for the confusion.  Did you have any other questions relative to the expenditure summary that I sent you?  I would be happy to discuss if you do.

We just received an invitation to speak at Ceraweek.

I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.

(IT budget for this year is $735mm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I'm still working on this one obviously)

Trying to keep it quiet too - sems to be working - Lavo didn't even see it

Yikes!  I sent the online photo editor your portrait -- and they've also got half a dozen photos of you that they shot!  I'll call the photo editor in the morning and have him replace the photo. kd

Hideous photo - couldn't we have given them a better one!

Here's the Fortune link...

Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.

But definitely put a list together.

Thanks

Louise, there are several universal issues that span the entire gas origination business.  I would like to put together a list of discussion topics for dinner to make sure that we table those items which are of most importance.  However, you may want the discussion to be more free flow.  If I pull together the topics it will be a list from all regions not just my own.  Would you prefer to take this in another direction or should I prepare the list ?

Frank

I can't tomorrow - how about next time she is in town.  Or in New York?

Fred called back and wanted to know if you could have lunch with Karen tomorrow?

Louise,
How would you like me to proceed?

Thanks!

We currently have 13 employees in Upstream Products.  Louise is aware of this and a seat reallocation needs to be done.

The attached spreadsheet represents a schematic of the ECS 5th floor.  Louise has taken the time to assign locations and number of desks to the various groups.

The Upstream group is located in desks 410-413, 416-419 and 425-426.  I recall that your original request was for 15 spaces, however Louise has allocated 10.  Please assign names to these desks and return to me by end of day Wednesday.  Please include first and last names to assist IT with workstation audits.  

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Re-sending with minor changes to the prior documents.  A clean copy is now provided.

Lance Schuler advised me that it is now Jeff Donahue, rather than Mark Metz, that needs to sign off on Corp's behalf, and that either Tim Detmering, Louise Kitchen or John Lavorato can approve on behalf of ENA.

 << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement.doc >>  << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement-Clean.doc >> 

A redraft of the ABB confidentiality/exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment.

This document is based on the form ABB provided and for which ABB has expressed a strong preference.  

This draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the Term (2 years).  As several of us have discussed, this will prevent ENA from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a DC transmission line within a 15-mile radius of San Francisco.  As I understand it, we are prepared to link arms with ABB to do this project because ABB is the premier supplier of this type of equipment. 

Based on recent discussions between Wayne and ABB, the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with ABB earlier.  The added language is somewhat lengthy, but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ENA against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction.  

Because this transaction does commit ENA to exclusivity obligations I understand that we will need to talk with Tim Detmering and Mark Metz about the transaction.  

Please let me know of comments.

Please advise.  Vickers had told me no "interruptible" in phase 1.  Please note long descriptions on certain firm gas products (constrained points) include an excuse of performance.  This may simply be a terminology issue.  
     This is contrary to what we had heard from Louise.  She is back

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

I have been in contact w/ the candidate and I will have comp/ HR details for your review shortly.  Who would you assign the business unit interface to be?  I assume this is sensitive and would not be routed through the current staff in Mexico.  After I have the compensation details etc.,  I need someone to have an initial phone screen/ touch base with the candidate.  Thank you.

Geoff,

Hi everyone

This is the regular review of all Enron SFA registered representatives who are currently based outside the UK or who are not directly employed by Enron.  I would be grateful if you could simply respond in the affirmative to this message, in order for me to maintain your current registered status.  If you have moved house in the past four months, I would also appreciate receiving this information.  

I would appreciate a quick response as, in the event that I receive no response from you by 22 October, steps will be taken to withdraw your individual registration.  

Thanks for your attention
Best regards
Julie

Great thanks

Louise,

I eliminated one of the examples as Frontera is not the greatest deal.

Tom.

 << File: Services Board Meeting.ppt >> 

Just a quick question  - 23 years for PGT?

Louise, please review and if you require more verbage I can add a lot more than this... I believe this captures the basic scope but if you think otherwise, let me know.

BT 

 << File: MEMO- Louise Kitchen.doc >> 

I concur with your view .

No to all of them

Louise

FYI, see the trail below.  The value prop is low and the related workload and risk are high... bad deal.  I'd like your thoughts if you get a minute.

Thanks for an engaging budget discussion last week,
Brad

I just spoke with Chris Edmonds.  There are 4 basic things he is requesting of Enron:

TQ receives the right to sell API's with limited EOL transactability
Brokers would be allowed to transact on EOL numbers through TQ site
Enron would post more products and terms on their site
The term of our Agreement would extend an additional 18 months

I told him that we have not yet reached strategic closure on selling API's or continuing Broker Client internally.  Even if we decided to pursue those activities, I explained that the value proposition for Enron doing it on its own was considerably more than TQ was offering us.  I made it clear that I was not going to drop everything and work on our API strategy just so that TrueQuote could get on with their business model.  I characterized the additional product and extended term requests as subsets of the first two and therefore also off the table.

I basically told him "no" and he said he would confer with Dennis and call back later in the week.

Please let me know if you have any questions,
Brad

Got the e-mail Chris Edmonds from TrueQuote sent to you.  

First, Brad Richter and Bob Shults know Chris well and are calling him today to let him know that we understand his request to you and that we will finalize a response to him early next week.

We completed the link to them as per our legal commitment earlier in the year and send to them the products we are required to as per the contract. Bottom line, we are absolutely honoring our contract with them.  However, they want to do more and that is what we are considering. 

Now, some history.  As you know, TrueQuote was supposed to be a robust, many-to-may site and function more like ICE does today.  Well, it doesn't.  It is basically a front end for EOL prices.  As of 9/27, 288 trades have occurred  for Enron at True Quote and the majority of those have been PG&E, an owner.  In August, it averaged 4 trades a day and in September, 1 trade a day.  

Issues arose a few months ago with them when they realized that they were struggling to be a true many-to-many exchange and wanted to sell APIs as TrueQuote to other companies.  This concerned us greatly since we felt, per our contract with them, that this was a technical and security issue for us.  Webb did not like it all for system security issues and we have a right in the agreement to say no because of that.  We also talked to other companies about an API to EOL and they said they were just going to get one from TrueQuote and that concerned us as well since the only thing at TrueQuote is our prices.

The broker portion is that they want to act like broker client.  As you know, the gas desks are indifferent to broker client but East Power does not like it for reasons I can explain later if you wish.  Therefore, they want to escalate broker client at a time when we are considering its cost/benefit for Enron.

Finally, if Dynegy puts prices there as well, that may be helpful to our equity but I don't think it is a high priority for EA as a trading company.

I discussed all this with Louise a month ago and I believe she supports our path.  I will check with her and Lavo Monday to make sure they are in agreement with any response we give to Chris.

Let me know if you need more info or want me to check with you as well before we respond to TrueQuote.

Thanks.

Greg,

Chirs Edmonds, of True Quote, has been calling for Greg and also sent this email (see below).  Greg has asked me to inquire about this w/you.  Please advise.  

Many Thanks,

Greg:

I need your guidance regarding a few issues currently outstanding with respect to the True Quote / EnronOnline relationship.  Practically speaking, Enron's internal decisions will determine the fate of True Quote in its current form.  I will outline the issues below and await your response.

We are closing in on a deal that will connect DynegyDirect to the True Quote platform.  We believe True Quote would have a strong competitive advantage against ICE if we have a commitment from Enron and DynegyDirect.  We are hestitant to move forward with Dynegy until we have a complete understanding of our relationship with Enron.

True Quote has made a proposal to EnronOnline that would create a revenue stream to Enron in return for a larger product commitment from Enron.  We are waiting on a response from Enron. 

True Quote needs the ability for brokers to transact with Enron through the True Quote interface.  We have agreed to the same terms and conditions as the Broker-Client product offering.  We are waiting on feedback from Enron.

We are confident True Quote would be greatly successful if we could execute the strategies outlined above.  We want to have a win-win relationship with Enron that allows us to shape the marketplace and compete aggressively against ICE. Due to the critical nature of these discussions and the associated timing, I chose to write you and ask for your guidance.  Right now, we need to know which direction Enron plans to take.  Regardless of the direction, our time is running short.  It is with the greatest respect for the way we began this relationship, that I ask you to help us evaluate this opportunity.

Should you wish to discuss these matters further, please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at virtually any time via my cell phone at 502-558-2568. 
  
Best regards,
Chris

What's wrong?

This is not going to work.  Do you want me to control the priority list like we used to do at Enron?  Please let me know.

Bill

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?

It'll happen

Well...

Due to calendar conflicts at Utilicorp, their President, Jim Miller and the Vice-President of the Utilicorp Utilities, Gail McMinn, will not be together and execute documents until next Monday, October 8.  The have an internal approval process similar to our DASH and they could not get all parties to execution by today.  

None of us like delays, but I remain extremely positive and assured on this transaction.

nearly time to go

Funny.

I spoke with Parquet and Mcdonald re contracts and offered the following:

Parquet:
Base - $200 - no increase
Signing - $100
Equity - $250

Mcdonald:
Base - $175 - no increase
Signing - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet's is identical to what you offered; Mcdonald is significantly less than Parquet and right in between Parquet and Dyer (50/150).

In line with the rest of the organisation

Base:		$200,000 
Signing:		$100,000 
Equity:		$250,000 equity (50/50) on signing

Louise -

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.

Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.

Issues:

Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident?
I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.

Thanks

	Please see the attached file that reflects the multiple for each asset sale.  As you can see for assets that had losses, we show no multiple.  Additionally, there are some assets that have no EBITDA at all (that we are aware of), thus we show no multiple.  Please let me know if this is what you expected.  Thanks!

Our little Rafferty was very pleased to see her mum and Personal Trainer Rita.

She was calm and sleepy and did lots of stretches and she stood still when we put her collar and leash on - gooood girl! No mess in her kennel either.

She did not go potty, but we had a good walk about. It's cool and shady up there - no problem with the temp.

She got an extra nice treat for being a good girl going back in her kennel - no cries - she's the best.

Obviously it is not what we want - we are assuming Anthony has power Beth has gas.

Louise,
 
I need to bring this to close.
 
I am going to decompose Beth's group into a number of smaller units, leaving the most important areas in ENA, namely GAS/Power Front and Back office. I am going to leave Anthony running EES, but need someone who can work well with Anthony on developing the strategy for the new longer term solutions, as well as what he is trying to achieve in the short term.
 
The final candidates are Steve Stock, Everett Plant, and as possible late entry John Paskin (although he doesn't know this yet and I have him tagged to run Corporate Systems). From a collaboration perspective I am leaning towards Stocky. We have all spoken with Everett and are impressed with his 'gloss'. I'm just not sure he is the right person to give the 'crown jewels' to, my gut tells me he is good at managing up, but may not be the best collaborative team member (and I need that).
 
Let mk know what you think
 
Thanks

Why is the CA dated August 6th - have we been sitting on it since then?

I have asked some of the originators to supply me with information re: EES approaching their customers. So far, I have received the following, all of which have occurred within the last few months:

1) Citgo Refining - Last month, we provided pricing for a facility in IL.  The customer indicated he already had a non-competitive bid from EES. 
2) AE Staley - the customer indicated he had recently been dealing with a representative from Enron Direct.  This was rectified when the rep left Enron last month.
3) Dow, Air Products, Praxair - EES spoke to them about a put option.
4) Abitibi, Shintech, Alcoa, Solutia, Kinder Morgan have all been approached by EES.

Dave

Is it written yet?

Louise,

Attached is the original email from Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. In my opinion, utilities and municipalities do not fall within the EES target market of being "less energy intensive and less sophisticated in their management of energy" (see below). Neither would aggregators fall into this category.

I am also concerned about the principle of EES approaching utilities to encourage them to act as an EES sales agent. I believe this ultimately results in little more than aggregation of load into wholesale levels - and in any case, results in multiple representatives from Enron pitching products which achieve similar results from the customer's perspective.

In addition, providing EES load management solutions may jeopordize other ENA projects which require that load (services deals, plant construction, etc. in addition to the usual wholesale product suite). I am concerned about the risk (however slight) posed by the EES activity as ENA actively tries to develop relationships with these customers and to close substantial wholesale transactions.

I'll wait for your thoughts on Monday before I go to EES with these concerns.

Thanks,

Dave

INTEROFFICE MEMO

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

Louise,

Attached is the email I spoke about.

I have had several informal comments from various Originators regarding running into EES at utilities and municipalities. This morning, BPUB informed me that EES is talking to them about sales to their customers under BPUB's label.

Dave
EES is now fully stepping into the Texas wholesale market with this.  Talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for EES to be doing.  This has to be stopped along with EES providing the "Whitepaper" products where they are providing wholesale products to San Antonio and others.  They are making Enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our SIC Codes that we have been working with toward a deal.

I think a meeting needs to be setup between Lavorato and Delainey or at your level to get this fixed.  I have tried working with my peers at EES and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our SIC code and even worse with IOU's and municipals.  

Looks like Ader & Co. at work in ERCOT.   I view this as a big problem.   These customers need to be covered by wholesale.   Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.

Tom,
Will you be available for the following visit?  This is another large group...  In order to keep this from being disruptive, we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews.  These overviews should only be 10 minutes in length.  One would be at 11:00 am and the other at 11:15 am.

Let me know if this is a possibility.

Thanks.

Who is paying the bills.... and how much are they? You would have to believe it is a lot. 

This is to confirm that I have reserved 6 tickets for you to attend the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix on Sunday, October 7.
I will be distributing the tickets no later than Monday, October 1.  (No charge will be allocated to your CO and RC.)
The main race begins at 1:00 pm on Sunday.

I am assuming that's it for this trip.  Please confirm there is nothing else like a restaurant reservatio or something?

I have been working with my national sales representative from the Four Seasons Hotel to minimize our contract obligations from our cancellation of the New York Customer Holiday Event dated November 30 - December 2, 2001.

The contract states that if Enron should cancel the entire event within 90 days - 61 days prior to the scheduled commencement date of the event, Enron would be liable for 50% of the hotels liquidated damages, which is estimated at $28,218.

After numerous conversations with the hotel, they have agreed to accept our initial deposit of $15,000 as full payment for the cancellation of this event.  No additional costs will be charged to Enron.  I believe that this is a fair offer and hope that all parties involved find this acceptable.

In the meantime, I received a call from Laura Luce this morning and she is interested in continuing this event on a much reduced scale.  The Four Seasons is willing to hold our initial reservation, with no additional penalties, until we can confirm if we would like to proceed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Let me check w/Louise.  

Liz, 
Does Gregg have an org chart for NETCO that I can take a peek at?
Frank

Maybe running Mexico replacing Max Yzaguirre - but it really comes down to cost.

I have attached the resume of Gerardo Segura who is interested in a position at Enron either in Europe or in the US, he currently lives in London.

Please review the resume and let me know if you see a possible fit within your worlds or know of anyone else that might be interested in him as I need to update Ken Lay within a week on his status.

Thank you,

Joe Deffner but what about the credit implications?

Louise, we have been pre-paying the positions to some of our customers. Some of them have been selling swaps to get rid financially of the Pemex Fixed Price contract, and then re-purchasing the swaps. In some cases they are asking to get pre-paid, so we call treasury and calculate the NPV with the discoutn rate they give us ( Usually Enron's Cost of Funds).
However, I have been able to increase the discount rate in various cases, so that we offer a better alternative to the customer, than their own cost of funds.  It has worked and I think we can increase our margins by keep on doing that.
Questions:  Can we get credit for the origination on top of Enron's treasury rate ?  If so, with whom should I speak to get it granted to EdeM ?

Best regards. 

Can we have all PIPS signed and on my desk by end of play tomorrow.

How good I am at responding - suffice to say I have stuck in budget meetings for the entire week.

Have you gone yet?  Are you free for lunch?

I'm going to be in Houston next week for some strategy meetings.  Are you
going to be in town?

Would love to be able to say hello.  I'll be arriving Monday afternoon and
leaving Thursday.

I will be reachable on my cell 617 686 2166.

Yup

Sure.  For now, can they be part of your 40 - 50 growth spots that we're targeting?

Tammy

Can you add these 5 temp slots on 5

Thanks

This in in response to your offer that you had a few spots on the trading floor when we could locate people that won't move to the new builiding until April.  All of these would be IT applications support.  I would feel comfortable naming names, so if you think you have 5 temporary spots for these people and need names, I will get them to you.  Thanks.  --Sally 

I think it would be a great idea if we could get a few extra spaces for
IT support in the new building.

We would need five spots.

Two for Enpower (one for risk, and one for volume mangement and confirms)
Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior
personnel. 

Let me know if you need anything else.

thanks

Ted,

The people included in the cc: are those people we nominate to interview on the below mentioned days.  We have not checked their availability and should you not find enough people from the list above please revert to John or I, but I think you have enough.

Louise 

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

It worked

They are pursuing because I requested to pursue.   The reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity.

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
 
John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward. 

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

You won - it was a convincing argument

Louise,

Tammy told me of your decision to put us in the tower, and I want to thank you for hearing our concerns.  I appreciate that you kept an open mind, and I sincerely think this arrangement is best for the company.

Thanks!

Mike

Could you fill in all the other assets 

Thanks

Louise,

Per your request.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Also, I need to clarify a point on New Albany gain/loss.

Thanks,

Don

 

What about the actual small video tape in the video camera?

Another work of art lost in the world!  Calgary didn't make a copy....

Mr Haedicke instructed destruction of the videos.  As we couldn't tell which was which - they all went.

I would assume Calgary has a copy.

Louise, do you have a copy of the Enron Canada video we showed in Beaver Creek?  I would like to show it to the Enron Toronto office....

Cheers, Paul D

Any volunteers to take on this project?

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

october preliminary invoice: 

Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product 
name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product 
type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the 
EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted 
every time the word "Topock" appears.
 
We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, 
but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index 
product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would 
also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
 
I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

so sorry to hear about your loss.  our thoughts will be with you.

without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would 
be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but 
i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume 
though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can.

All-

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

please add Astra Power LLC to the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

hey heath -- sorry it took so long to get back to you -- we plan on at least 
going to dinner -- dont know how long we'll stay out after that -- i'll do my 
best.  See you there.

Here is the resume we talked about:  

 - Resume 2.doc

here are the two new index descriptions that we need:
 
For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr
For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top
 
 
Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special 
language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are 
subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all 
interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating 
conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and 
are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
  
We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can 
come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational 
constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it 
should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.

hey girl -- havent talked to you in a while.  just wanted to catch up and see 
whats new.

i will be attending

nasdaq is scary!  you think we could lose another 30% of what we have in 
there??  should we just leave it in for the long term and wear all the pain 
now?

you should see me try to play golf right now - it is downright comical.

i still cannot see the blanco physical index restricted products on the web.  
my ID is ADM44643.  can you please get me access as soon as possible.  
thanks.

i got ahold of them and they are going to stop by the house tomorrow and look 
at everything and give us an estimate

here's the right email address.  talk to you soon.

hey jack -- sorry i missed your call the other night -- i've either been out 
or exhausted every night.  this whole pregnancy thing is really tiring.  
anyway, i just wanted to get back to you - i'll try to call soon -- didnt 
want you to think i was ignoring you.

I have a friend who is possibly interested in the trading positions that we 
have open, but I wanted to find out exactly what types of trading positions 
they are.  CAn you give me some more details?  thanks.

Here is the way we would like to see the restricted list for the EP Blanco 
Avg products -- I have omitted and added counterparties.  Can we make these 
changes as soon as possible?  I would like to be able to tell the new 
counterparties as soon as possible so they can start clicking!  Thanks!
 
 

I'm feeling great - other than not being able to sleep very well - and this 
is just the beginning of that!   Anyway, thanks for forwarding Pat's resume.  
He does like what he is doing there most of the time, but I have been pushing 
for a little more stability from him to take some of the pressure off 
myself.  Thanks again.

i show -.05 in my notes as well as on the paper ticket

I'm glad everything worked out for you.  Hope you have a great time!

Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas 
trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question 
for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I 
have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.

The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why 
we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso 
Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that 
El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, 
both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We 
feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing 
field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be 
directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, 
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and 
they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on 
eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help.

We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 
1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these 
RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, 
will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away.  
Please let me know what I need to do.

I need to add some more people to our restricted list for our blanco product, 
but i need someone from eol to send me an update of the current list.  Can I 
get this today?  Thanks.

i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you 
really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than 
understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really 
hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than 
spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you 
about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once 
again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you 
wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love 
you!

Take a look at the Star's schedule and let me know if a date works for
you.  I will do everything I can to get the tickets reserved for you.

I'm so glad you wrote back.  Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?  I have 
been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by 
the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I 
had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet?  
How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I 
can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years?  
That makes me feel old!  I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought!  
Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call 
first - my number is 281-578-9135.  
 
P.S. -- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest 
friends and she says "HI."

Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you 
haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been 
feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your 
life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out 
in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're 
expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see 
what's going on with you.  Write back if you can.

I'd like a swatch of Seaside Baby.  My mailing address is  4419 Stackstone Ln.
        Katy, TX 77450

Oh - i forgot to mention - John Perdew wants your body.

Hi Amber.  I have misplaced my truequote ID and password and I would like to 
start looking at the system (finally).  Is there any way you could send me my 
info again?  Thanks, Tori.

WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her 
at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever 
a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 
11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live 
close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it 
there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March.  
I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really 
well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and 
catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new 
email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun 
planning the wedding!

hey - just wanted to see hoe your trip went - i dont even know if you're back 
yet.  

Hey Sean!  I just thought about you yesterday because I remembered your 
birthday was coming up.  I have no idea if this is the correct email address 
for you, so I won't write too much.  Write back if you can - I have alot to 
tell you.

hey fletch - i was wondering if you had any access to bbq cookoff tickets for 
the enron tent this weekend.  i have a friend coming in from new york and he 
really wants to swing by there.  let me know.  thanks

hey jake - we arent going to be able to make it tonight, but thanks for the 
invite.  had fun sat night!  see ya soon.

phillip is a buyer of calpine - CPN - you wanna check into that?

that sounds awesome - dont catch any dangerous diseases.  do you know scott 
thompson at southern?  if you do, i heard he has connections in south 
africa.  i probably wont talk to you again before you leave so - have a great 
time.  i wanna hear all about it when you get back.  take care.

well - sounds like you had a great birthday!  whats your next stop?  still 
florida??

hey - just wanted to say happy birthday!  and, find out how you're doing - 
perfect i'm sure.  you would totally laugh if you saw me right now - i'm 
starting to look pretty darn preggo.  anyway - i may try to call you later 
today.  take care.

maybe - what do you think?

I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i 
received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and 
not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status 
of the printer?  Thanks.

we arent busy - looks like jen may be trying to put together a happy 
hour/early dinner for friday - she just sent me an IM - i'm assuming it's not 
in honor of your birthday because it wasnt mentioned.  i wont mention it if 
you dont want me to.  anyway - she did ask about you - said she hadnt talked 
to you in a while.  as far as i know - we have no plans as of yet for the 
whole weekend - i know how much you love football , but maybe we can just 
hang out on sunday and watch the game - make some good food - etc.  by the 
way - i went to the doctor yesterday and he said everything looks perfect 
right now - that was awesome news - i'm going to get an ultrasound sometime 
in the next 2 weeks- hopefully i can find out what i'm having!  i lost my 
waist over the weekend - definitely in the maternity clothes now even though 
they all look huge.  anyway - talk to you soon

we had a couple of different deal numbers that we were using for december 
purchases from sg interests.  we bought a volume of 689 at a price of 9.25 on 
12/21 on deal 528768.  however, the next day - we bought a volume of 689 at a 
price of 9.84 on 12/22 on deal 510431.  the counterparty agrees with me and 
they will be reinvoicing us.

hey brook - i was wondering if you sent that check - because if you did - i 
didnt get it- no big deal - just checking

hey girl - you guys doing anything tonight?

just confirmed with mike - we are still good with that offer.

just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm 
sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great 
deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - 
my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby 
- due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a 
mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need 
to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit 
me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo 
stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was 
the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 
years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.  
anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing 
back from ya.

I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the 
item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which 
should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still 
says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay?

these charges are not valid  - we will not pay penalties on a swing deal at a 
constrained point.  several people on the desk discussed this potential 
problem, and the trader at agave has already been notified that will do not 
intend on paying any penalty charges.  this deal was done on a gtc - spot 
contract, not on their firm agreement.

thanks for your help - and, i hate to revisit this again, but can you send me 
a current list of the counterparties that have access to the blanco 
restricted product.  i am still getting complaints from people who should 
have access, but they are telling me that they do not.  thank you.

Thanks for having the league.  I'd definitely do it again next year.  Here's 
my address -        4419 Stackstone Ln.
              Katy, TX  77450

the price on the deal was 10.30

  Here you go!  Happy New Year!

the current bid for jan-june for the west texas pool gas would be HSC-.06.  
this bid should be right on the market according to what i have found.  
please feel free to check around if you'd like, but i will need an answer 
today if you want be to start pulling gas on the 4th.  thanks.

I'm so glad you wrote me back - sounds like you're a very busy person, but it 
looks like you're getting to do what you wanted to do.  As for me, I got 
married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at 
UT.  We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.  Anyway, we'll 
be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.  I 
spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am 
doing something completely different that I absolutely love.  I work for 
Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.  I'm 
trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and 
challenging.  My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has 
not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.  We bought a 
house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved 
into a new house that we built in Katy.  We wanted to be close to my parents 
and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live 
there.  Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.  Oh yeah - and my address 
is:
4419 Stackstone Ln.
Katy, TX 77450
I hope we can keep in touch.  I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever 
make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.  Give me some more details in the 
next email!
Take Care and Happy Holidays!
 
 
Love, 
Tori

just thought you folks mite find this interesting......
This is too funny:

A quote from "Centuries,"  a book
of prophesies written by Nostradamus.

"Come the millenium, month 12, in the home of greatest power, the Village
Idiot will come forth to be acclaimed the leader."

Have you ever asked your child a question too
many times? I hope you remember my story when they start getting
frustrated! My three year old son had a lot of problemswith
potty training; and I was on him constantly. One day we
stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch between errands. It was
very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco I
smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven month
old daughter. And she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked, and he said, "No." I kept
thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have any
clothes with me.
"Then I said, "Matt, are you sure you did not
have an accident?" "No," he replied. I just knew that he must have
had, because the smell was getting worse. So I asked one
more time, "Matt, did you have an accident?" This time he
jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread h! is
cheeks and yelled "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!" While
100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he
calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if
nothing had happened. I was mortified but some kind elderly
people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me
for the best laugh they had ever had

Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

Thirsty Cowboys:

Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from 
their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking 
quietly about cattle prices.

Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, 
begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real 
distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.

"Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.

No, the woman shakes her head.

"Kin ya breathe?" asks the other.

The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first 
cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her 
panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the 
small of her back.

This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her 
mouth, and she begins to breathe again.

The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His 
partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I 
never seen anybody do it."

FYI.
The filed version of the comments in the San Diego Gas & Electric matter at 
FERC is attached.

email address.  Thank You.

hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner 
the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop 
you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same 
around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born 
-- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt 
sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or 
anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an 
experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a 
good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so 
"hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."

i think pat and i have decided to wait until he can be listed on the loan 
before we actually lock this thing up.  we are still going to do it, but we 
both feel better about having both names on the documents.  can you tell me 
exactly how long we will ahve to wait after he starts working?

still on for lunch today??

Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( 
One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as 
well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental 
Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made 
Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own 
travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  
This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a 
vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on 
December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from 
my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due 
to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not 
be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I 
spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he 
indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on 
September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I 
book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same 
policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel 
like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable 
policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my 
situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a 
vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month 
old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help 
me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your 
policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He 
was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for 
the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work 
about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping 
that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your 
competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a 
credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another 
person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as 
a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my 
personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has 
definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you 
can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.

oh - ok --  she hasnt said anything but that doesnt surprise me -- she is 
actually the manager of the group and she usually doesnt talk much about her 
interviews -- i'll see what i can find out.

i talked to steve and he liked you alot -- who else did you talk to??

thanks so much - i am going to write her in addition to sending the 
invitation since it looks like she wont be in town anyway.

hey there.  i was wondering if you have nicole's address.  i wanted to get 
terra to send her a baby shower invitation just in case she might be coming 
into town, or at least it will serve as an announcement anyway.  thanks.

do you not have instant messenger at work anymore??

river trip sounded like a blast!  the pool is going well - next step is the 
deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 
weeks.  pat got a job  - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be 
working downtown at waste management.  it was a pretty good offer -- good 
benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he 
had at bank united.  we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for 
me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care 
center -- that was a big relief.  so -- things continue to fall into place -- 
we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues...

hey there - i was just talking about you with my mom - she said she talked to 
you again today and i was laughing that she's talked to you alot more than i 
have lately!  dinner friday sounds great.  what else have you been up to??  
did you already have the river trip??  we havent been out at all -- just too 
tiring for me to do anything but dinner right now.  we're just trying to get 
everything ready -- it's pretty exhausting.  well - i better get back to work 
-- talk to you soon and see you friday!

for deal 694859 -- it should be 4.48 
 
  for deal 697646 -- for the 30-31 it should be 4.50

we all have the same address but different work station locations - let me 
get them for you -- 
 
 our street address is 1400 Smith
               Houston, TX 77002
 
here are the work locations:
 
Tori  EB3208C
Randy  EB3208D 
Patti  EB3208E
Kelli  EB3235B
 
Hope that helps.

thursday sounds great -- and around 1130 would be good if you can make it -- 
we can go to bourays, ny pizzeria, allen center -- whatever you want.

just seeing if you were back from your trip.  maybe we can go for lunch 
sometime this week. let me know when you're free.

Tori,

What we'll have to do is to move those products which are in the restricted 
product types to the regular product types.  Then I will set the restricted 
product types to archived. We will need to coordinate as to when you want to 
do this.

Thanks,

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

 looks good 

we will agree to cancel these trades and reconfirm new ones.

Tori,

Please disregard my prior email - I mispelled Socal's email address.  Their
address is now correct.

As we discussed, Astra incorrectly confirmed the two imbalance trades
detailed below.   Tony at SoCalGas said he can cancel the trades if Astra
and Enron send him an email requesting the trades be cancelled.

Trades to Cancel:
To confirm that you agree to cancel, then please forward this to him at
gtcalendar@socalgas.com and indicate that you agree.   (You can also hit
"REPLY ALL" since I cc'd on this email).   I will call you and let you know
what the new downstream contract will be.

Thanks

All-

The total nomination for month of May 2001 is 10,526MMBtu per day.  This odd
number is made up of the sum of the following:

1. 4,026MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased again from April 2001 to 2.63%.  We
have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

We will still operate with only one steam unit (Broadway 3) on line for most
of the month.  Sometime about the fourth week of May, we will be bringing
one more steam unit on line.  At that time, I may need to increase our
nomination.  With the increasing temperatures and the possibility that the
ISO will begin paying generators, we expect our fuel usage to actually reach
and occasionally exceed our nomination in May.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I

the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.

trades.

the trader over there is JB Smith.  if you would like - you can send me a 
copy of the invoice, and we will send them a letter with the invoice attached 
- and tell them to stop sending invoices to you because we consider the 
issure to be resolved.

wow - thats awesome - have a great time -- bring pictures to the baby shower 
-- you should be getting an invitation soon -- i think my friend jennifer is 
sending them out early next week.  i cant believe i only have 7 weeks left!

damn  - we eat really early here - they bring lunch at 11 oclock if you can 
believe it.  maybe i will come meet you anyway and not eat - it's dead here 
today.  when and where were you planning on going??

i am not in risk - can you get with anne bike and explain what you need her 
to do?  thanks.

Hi.  I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the 
new day care center.  I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether 
or not we have been accepted.  I know the center doesn't open until 
September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line 
something up if I do not get in.  Also , do you know an exact date for the 
scheduled opening?  Thanks for your help.
Thank you for your Pre-Enrollment Application for our Enron Kid's Center.

If you have questions related to the care of your child, lottery, room
capacity, tuition, wait-listing, etc...please email your questions to
gwing@knowledgebeginnings.com.  If you have questions related to enrollment
information, please email cfranklin-rhem@klcorp.com.

Thanks again!

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

can you just let me know one way or the other if his background would be 
compatible with anything that might come up?  thanks.

thanks

hey dan - it's tori from the good ole west gas desk.  i was talking to the 
klapper the other day and he said that i might be able to forward my hubby's 
resume to you to see if you knew of any good fits for his experience in your 
arena.  his background is in ecommerce account management/development and 
other IT consulting and auditing.  i'm gonna go ahead and attach his resume.  
please let me know if you think there's anything here for him - i would 
greatly appreciate the help.   
 
 
 
thanks,
 
tori

hope everyone is okay with this -- i talked to the people that were here and 
we all agreed.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the 
birthdays simple.

hey - thats funny about john - he definitely remembers him - i'll call pat 
and let him know - we are coming on saturday - i just havent had a chance to 
call you guys back --  looking forward to it -- i probably need the 
directions again though

i will be here all this week and really any time after about 10 am is fine to 
stop by

Looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the 
decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current 
product and create a new one also

Hello - I was the one who asked about your high chair covers at Fuzzy's pizza 
the other night.  I was wondering if i could get more information on patterns 
and cost.  Thank you.

i never heard back on this request -- was it done??

please add Astra Power LLC to the restricted list for the EP Blanco Avg 
products.  thank you.

you are so sweet to think of me.  i dont know why you would ever be in 
houston, but if you are, we definitely need to get together.  talk to you 
soon.

what we decided is that we are all bringing something and i provide the 
drinks.  i havent heard back from everyone yet but my gut instinct is that we 
will need at least one extra person.  it looks like everyone that was there 
last time is coming again and also kristi said she would be there, but that 
still leaves us short.  i hope the pool construction doesnt disrupt y'all too 
much.  the good thing is that my dad is overseeing it and he is being really 
hard on the guys, making sure they are as clean and quick as they can 
possibly be.  kim already said that jeffrey cant wait to come swimming.  
we'll have to get a water basketball goal - pat will love playing with all 
the kids.

hey there!  hope everything is going great with you.  things are still going 
pretty smoothly with me - thank goodness.  my actual due date is 6/11 so i 
only have about 2 months left.  i'm starting to realize why people are always 
miserable in the last couple of months.  anyway - my address is 4419 
Stackstone Ln.     Katy, TX 77450.  Talk to you soon.

hey beverly -- do you have phone numbers for any of the people that werent 
there last time??

Hey Keith.  It was great catching up last night.  In response to our conversation, although I have already sent me resume there through a head hunter, I thought I would also forward it to you directly.  I'd love to have lunch with you in the near future to talk about the prospects.

so far - i guess its a good thing you didnt get on here after all

Tori,

Did you make it through the cuts?  

Later,

Hello Friends!

Anyone interested in going to dinner this Friday night?  Ed and I haven't
seen you guys in awhile and with the holidays coming up, it may be January
before we can all get together again.  I am open for suggestions as to where
we go.  Guess it really depends on the number of people we have that can
make it.  However, I was thinking around 7pm as the time.  Momma over here
gets hungry and tired early, so don't want to make it a late night.  :)

Let me know if you are interested in getting together.  Pam feel free to
invite Carla and her husband as I know you mentioned something about that
earlier and Pat and Tori please bring Erin if you want.  We would love to
see her and can go where she will be welcome.

Jennifer

we have a meeting at 3 today -- cnbc is doing a report at 3:50 -- i will let you know

Here are Jake's thoughts on the situation.  Chris said he would be willing
to take you to lunch - completely under the radar if you can break away
sometime.  He said you can also just call him at home to discuss how the
environment is (team vs. individuals focused on bonuses).  He also indicated
the package for your level is in the six figures.  I have all his
information if you need it.  By the way, he reports up through Randy right
now...

On another topic.  Rick Riley thinks we are about to see capitulation in
Enron.  He thinks we should through out a number we are comfortable with and
when the stock comes down hard, it will take the number out (10K shares a $9
is what he recommends).  He also believes it will be a short-lived hard
drop. Then the stock will spring back up very quickly (I suppose he means to
above book value) and underperform the market for six months.  He thinks
Enron employees who stay on board will be rewarded handsomely..

I have heard that a couple of companies have stopped trading with them, but
I don't know which ones.  I don't think the banks will let the company
totally go down, but I do think they are in for a rough ride over the next
year or so.  The problem is that Enron is such a huge player in the energy
markets that the market is fairly illiquid and inefficient without them.
Therefore, it is in everyone's best interest (including the banks and
counterparties) for Enron to make it out of this.

Beginning to get real nervous about the big E.  It's below book value now
and there is no bounce in sight.  I can't imagine what kind of interest rate
a
bank would slap on Enron right now in their dire situation for money. 

note - don't open if it is not warranted or welcomed

we would also like to keep all files under g:\west desk\gas reports
and matt lenhart needs to keep a file on his h: drive called "matt-pl"

Jeff,

If there is no limit to size, we would ideally like to move everything within the following directories:

o:\ect_trading\West
r:\webcontent\GasTrading\west_desk

Let me know if we need to narrow these anymore.  They include all west desk files on the network excluding those in the central fundies directories.  Also, will we have a mechanism to transfer individual network directories from the H: drive?  In not, we'll move everyone's directories into one of the above directories.  Thanks.

Mat

so - here's the synopsis - everything is business as usual - we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100% - we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours - it's going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company.

ok - let me know when you guys can try to come up with a solution.  also, mike would like to know if eol can work on a new functionality that would allow a trader to create a fixed price physical product that could link to price, basis, and index in order to prevent arb opportunities from the market.  any ideas on that?

I apologize for not getting back with you all last week.  We ran a few transactions on the spread product with the Auto Hedge function, but no hedge transaction was booked.  Unfortunately, this function is not available on the spread product itself.  I will let you know if/when a solution is available to accomodate this request.  It has been brought to our attention before.  The only immediate solution would be to manually change the risk book, but I know you guys do not want to go that route.  I'll be in touch.

Chris

Any ideas, yet on whether we can get these spreads into the correct books ?

Let me know.

Thanks

Anne

I will leave it in Chris' hands.  Once we have a solution.... then we will start testing again.

Thanks,

Melba

Melba:  I do not know if you talked to Chris, but Tori is willing to wait until we resolve the issue of which book the spreads are valued in.  Chris was going to look at the possibility of using auto hedge to resolve the issue.  Have you spoken to him, since Wednesday morning ?

Let me know where the auto hedge issue stands and then we can go ahead from there.

Thanks.

Anne Bike

Attached is the Transaction report for the spread deals I had sent for your review.  Please let me know what else I can do to get this approved. 

Thanks,

Melba

 << File: Tori - spreads.xls >> 

david - where are we on this?  is there any hope of getting this done?

Tori,

	I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten about you.  Kim Alexander who has really been the authority on the pricing information was involved in an auto accident this previous Sunday.  He'll be returning to work next Wednesday and would be able to complete this much faster than anyone else trying to pick it up.

I'll keep you informed next week as to how it goes.

Thanks for your patience,

Dave

I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

 << File: DailyPrices.xls >> 
This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.

why dont i try kim or marta first?  

I wonder if your mom would let me drop off Erin this afternoon for a couple
of hours so I can clean the house....

i talked to chris a little bit and he is going to call back tonight at 6 at home.

I made some minor enhancements to your document.  Specifically, I inserted
the word "team" into the document as much as possible.  I also replaced the
word "group" with "team" as Dynegy focuses on this aspect...  My changes are
noted in BOLD-BLUE text..

agreed

Probably best to just give her a card and then drop it off for her. No need
to lug something that heavy upstairs.

Pam

I bought Jennifer's gift last week -- I ended up getting them a stroller
since what we originally picked out had already been purchased.

I wanted to get your opinion on something -- the stroller box is pretty big
and heavy.  I'm not sure how much luck I would have getting it up to the
second story of Susan's house, so what I was thinking was that we could
give her a card which says what we got her and either leave the actual gift
downstairs at Susan's house during the shower or in the back of my Jeep and
I could drop it off at Ed & Jennifer's house after the shower.  Also, if we
go with the card idea, do you think I should still wrap the stroller box?

Let me know what you think.  I'll be at work today until 4:30.  I'm taking
off tomorrow so if you need to get in touch with me tomorrow, just call me
at home and leave a message if I'm not there (713-721-7101).

See you Saturday!!!

Are we still on for Wednesday?

                                                                                                                   
                    "Hadix, Susan"                                                                                 

Jennifer mentioned we should all do dinner together once a month.  I think
it's a great idea and would like to commit to the next date.  How about
you?
I was looking at Wednesday, November 14th.  This is definitely open to
suggestions.

Thanks!

ok - so we all owe $45 -- somebody can just give me $20 and then everyone else can pay dana.  I'm not in a hurry so no biggie.

The stroller was $162.36.

                                                                                                                   
                    "Hadix, Susan"                                                                                 

Hi all,

We need to figure out how much we owe and to who now.  I think we all
agreed
we would not include food now, only the flowers, stuffed animals, cake and
stroller.

Tori, you mentioned to me you spent $65.00 on the cake, flowers and
animals.

Dana, can you please let us know the total for the stroller?  If you did
already I apologize.  I don't remember it.

I think Saturday went great...we all worked so well together and Jennifer
was very happy.  Cheers to us!

Thanks!

I'm jealous - i can't go wednesday!   have an interview and that was the only time they could do it.  

I second Grotto - it's my favorite!!!

Well now that sucks...make me choose the place.  No bitching allowed then!
ha, ha

I was thinking America's but Jennifer is having lunch there today w/her
Mom.
We can shoot for that another time for sure.

Here are my suggestions:  Mi Luna, Fox Diner, Grotto

All are very good...I lean towards Grotto.  There's my 2 cents.

Let me hear what you all think.

Susan,

Since you want to make the reservations, why don't you go ahead and choose.
Someone else can pick next time and make the reservations.

Pam

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder about dinner Wednesday night, November 14th.  Is
everyone
still available?  We should pick a spot and I will make reservations.  I
only ask we don't do BBQ.  I can't get excited about BBQ. ;-)

Thanks!

well - it's okay -- alot of people here are really confident about going head to head with dynegy traders and kicking their asses -- and i've had a pretty good year so i'm not that worried -- but - that said -- i do have a couple things lined up just to see if there's something better -- what about you?  did you get your interview at pan can yet??

CUTE!  ur right she does look just like pat.  how is the work environment at ene these days?  are you actively seeking alternative employment?

i'm doing great -- the baby is so much fun but alot of work -- i feel tired 90% of the time -- enron is actually okay -- i feel good about my chances to stay on with the "new empire" -- but, i'm still taking this as an opportunity to explore some other options to see if there may be something incredible out there that i am missing out on.  what's new with you??

What a doll.

She is a very cute baby!

How are you doing?  What's the latest with Enron?

Here are the latest and greatest.  Actually not too outdated.

advice -- any trips you want to take - do it now - start saving a bunch of money - and just remember -- when you start trying - it could happen on the first try!!!

I'm happy to hear that your chances to stay on are good, but like you said
it never hurts to explore the outside world.  Things are going pretty well
for me, I'm actually on my week off from work.  I'm still working on the
Real Time desk, I really enjoy it.  The shift work doesn't bother me, I only
end up working about 12 days a month so there is plenty of free time.
Stacey is no longer with Bristol Myers.  She and one of her co-workers
wanted to job share, but the company denied them, so she is working part
time as a nurse.  It's pretty cool, she gets to set her own schedule and she
only works twice, sometimes three days a week.  Our goal was to get her on a
part time position.  We are ready to have a little bundle of joy ourselves,
I think we are going to start trying in May.  Any advice?  Keep me posted on
what happens at Enron.

Take care.

Scotty

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Keep volume low :)

Another one!  

I think I want to adopt this kid....

hey ken -- looking forward to meeting with randy tonight (he probably told you already) -- i know he's talked to some other people that he hasn't been too impressed with -- do you know if there is anything special that he's looking for -- or i should say -- anything that specifically rubs him the wrong way -- my only bonding experience with him has been making fun of janie at parties!!

I'M IN -- assuming we leave at 3 which i think is the case

Hey there,
I think mike and sue are in for tomorrow at the FP.  I hope you can come.  
Later - MO

hey - thanks for getting back anyway -- i thought it went pretty well - he said -- let's keep talking -- kevin masek was there too - i stayed for a drink with him after randy left and he thought it went really well.  i had a good time -- seemed like he was trying to be pretty formal though.  i was pretty excited with what he had to say about their plans and i know i would get along well with the people that are there so far.  and, i think i can bring alot to the table for him.  we'll see what happens.  i know he'll tell you everything :).

Sorry I didn't get a chance to talk with you prior to your interview.  I was out
of the office on Wednesday and Thursday.  How did it go?  I would say the main
thing that Randy is looking for is a person that he personally likes and can get
along with.  He would pass on the best trader in the industry if he thought the
guy/girl was a jerk.  Randy is a family man.  He likes people that spend time
with their families (especially with their kids).  Randy is the most honest
person I have ever met.  I would love to work for him!  Good Luck!

Let me know what you thought!

Ken

any new progress on this??

Dave -- 

I've access to the MKM data sources and am investigating what resides there and how 
it can be requested and assembled.  I spoke to Thomas yesterday and it looks like they 
have all the ERMS curves and can convert the curve amounts into any currency so Frankie's
rate service might not be required afterall.

My hope is to use MKM to retrieve the data sets as XML, smash them together on time boundaries,
and use XSLT to peform simple math, translation and presentation functions.

I've updated Tori that I now have access to the datasource and am looking into what's 
there and how to assemble it.   Fortunately for me she's been very patient -- as I've not been 
able to provide her with an estimate yet, but will do so as soon as I understand what's all involved.

Kim

can i write you a check for this?  and, by the way, have people been paying you, because alot of people dont read their email

I keep forgetting to ask you, but I need to collect $12 from each of you for Mike's boss's day present.  

Thanks!
Ina

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

What is this project?

Yes!

I just wanted to send a follow-up thank you for dinner the other night.  It was nice to see you again and to hear about the exciting prospects you have at RWE.  I know I would enjoy being a part of your trading team, and I truly believe that I can provide you with a good base a knowledge and a strong desire to continue to grow as a trader within your organization. 

I heard a rumor that you guys may be hiring -- is this true, and, if so -- for what?

i have dinner at my parents' tonight -- meeting my brother's girlfriend!!  have fun though.

Ed and I are going to dinner at Maggiano's on Wednesday and wanted to know
if anyone was interested in joining us.  We will most likely head up there
around 6:30ish.  Depending on how many people, I may try to get a
reservation, so let me know ASAP if you are interested in going.  If we
don't see you tomorrow, then hope you all have a Happy Thanksgiving.

susan was already paying me -- i think there may be some confusion - i'll let you guys work it out -- thanks!

Tori, I have your check sitting on the counter.  I just need your address to mail it to you.  I'm sorry it has taken so long to get back with you.  I hope you guys have a great Thanksgiving! 
Suzanne 

sounds great - we will definitely try to see you that weekend -- cinco ranch is actually public so that shouldnt be a problem -- willow fork is private but i think you can rent it and just pay more -- i went to a reception at the equestrian center once and that was really nice -- i know whatever you choose will be beautiful -- take care -- see you soon.

Thanks!  We will be in town on December 8th.  We are going to try to visit
some reception sites and see everybody.  I don't know exactly how, but we
are going to try.  Diane can probably update you with more details as it
gets closer.

I want to look at some places near Katy.  I am going to try to look at the
Equestrian Center and maybe the Cinco Ranch Country Club (if it lets
non-members use their facility).  I am going to try to have a all-in-one
place.  Ceremony and Reception.  But I may have to find a church.  Who
knows right now?

Hopefully we will see you soon.  I want to see ERIN!!!  Tell Pat that I
said "HI".    Nicole

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!    I'm all teary eyed!  I knew you picked a good
one!!

Bryan and I decided to start putting up the Christmas decorations this
week.  Sunday, we got the tree out of the closet and set that up in the
living room.  Our plan was to do a little bit every night.  By
Thanksgiving, we would have a beautifully decorated house.  On Monday,
Bryan put the lights on the tree.  Then I started unwrapping some of the
ornaments.... just to look at them.  Well, after I unwrapped *all* of
the
ornaments, we decided to finish trimming the tree.  Bryan was hanging
back
and letting me do most of the decorating.  Though I did notice that one
of
the first ornaments that he put on the tree was my heart shaped Nicole
ornament.  After we finished, we sat in the glow of the big bulb lights
and
admired our tree.  That was when Bryan informed me that I did not find
my
NEW ornament.  He had put something new on one of the trees.  (we have a
charlie brown tree in the bedroom and the big tree in the living room.)
I
could not find anything new on the charlie brown tree so I moved to the
big
tree.

After surveying the big tree for a few moments, the little girl in me
said,
"Look for a ring, look for a ring".  But the practical side of me said,
"Find the ornament".  Well, just about then I found a beautiful diamond
ring hanging from the heart shaped Nicole ornament.  My engagement ring
had
been on the tree the entire time.  I was so focused on the decorating
that
I never saw it.  Bryan has since been teasing me that any other woman
would
have known right away that there was a diamond ring on the tree.

I am very happy and excited to tell everyone that Bryan and I are
engaged
to be married.  We do not have a date, time, place or even a ctiy yet.
I
just couldn't wait to tell everyone.  I know that I will be wearing a
big
smile for a long, long time!

Happy Holidays, Nicole

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!    I'm all teary eyed!  I knew you picked a good one!!

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Hello Mrs. Kuykendall, hope all is well with you and the baby.  All done with my trip round the world (and got a big boy email account as well now that employers will be looking at it!) and of course i have to go through the dreaded interviewing process to find gainful employment..... just spoke with a head hunter lady who is going to help me find a trading job in gas/power and of course i left her your name as one of my many pristine references.  I left keith's as well.  Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!  For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.  Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.  Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w! ere both pretty good.  got any recommendations of your own?

Tori, 
Thanks for handling my resume within your department, and for the suggestions for other job possibilities.  It was great talking to you and I hope we can stay in touch.

I need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol.  Thanks.

i guess i need access to view the site with the p/l, that is, if i am supposed to have it.

i did that the first time -- it takes me to a page that says i do not have permission to view that sight -- and it directs me to send you an email

Use your nt login.  

i guess i need access to view the site with the p/l, that is, if i am supposed to have it.

i cant remember who you forwarded this request to -- she said it was done but i still cannot see the products.  my eol id is ADM53618 -- maybe it was updated on the wrong one.

I need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol.  Thanks.

login  tkuyken   pword  tkuyken1                   
Please send me your EOL stack manager login and password.  Mike Grigsby would like for me to put together a one page reference for the desk so that trades can be monitored and in the event of someone being out of the office.
 
Thanks!
-Ina

let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is  -- it may be closer to ngpl perm -- i have no idea until i see the physical location

Tori:  This is really a central issue, but they are asking us for the appropriate curves. I think they have been asked to move some old central deals from WNG Williams to WFSC\Perminan.  My suggestion is:

intraminth Curve  - IF-ELPO/PERMIAN
gas daily curve   -  GDP/ELPO/PERM2.

Let me know what you think.  

Thanks

Anne

deal ticket numbers are 139899 and 139900 with coinciding deals 309061 and  307072.

I set up the new zone in Global, however before we can move any deals to this location it needs to mapped
to a valid intramonth, long term and gas daily curve. Wes, can you or someone in risk let me know which curves?
Perhaps it can be mapped like some other location that already exists.

Thanks
GG

Per Wes Dempsey I need the following Trade Zone created for the following pipeline.

Pipeline Name:	  Williams Field Services Inc.
Trade Zone:	  Permian	
Meter #:	  27869

Please let me know when the Trade Zone is completed.  Furthere, I need your final approval to change the Trade Zone for this meter.

Thank you,

glad you made it safely!  enjoy the snow!  my home email is patrick_kuykendall@hotmail.com.  talk to you soon -- take care

Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a "Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.

Sno-mo

i heard this yesterday!  perfect example of the state of our economy!

Sweet....

If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, 
it would now be worth $49. 

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one year
ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you
would have $79. 

My advice to you is to start drinking. Heavily.

i'm at a loss on calpine also -- seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building -- seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line -- i dont know - just a thought -- the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me.

I want to put a stop-loss on MS at 49.  It's support is at 50 and if it
breaks that mark.  It will fall to 45 quickly and possibly down to the 30's.
We can hold if you want to though.  SAP already said they would not let CMRC
go bankrupt.  SAP also indicated CMRC book value to be no less than $4.00.
We should probably just ride this one out.  I have no idea about CPN...

can you give me the address for the kids center so i can complete the nomination form -- also do we put knowledge beginnings or lorraine as the center director?

Hi Lorraine.  I was trying to complete the form to nominate the Kid's Center for this award and I need the phone number and fax number there.  I'm not sure why I don't have them, but I don't.  Thanks for your help.

I cried I laughed so hard at this....

George-please keep sending forwards like this my way.

T

 

Hey Fritz.  I am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings.  In addition, I will also personally tell the hiring manager that I have done this and I can also give him an extra copy of youe resume.  Hopefully we can get something going here....

Tori,

I received your name from Diane Hoyuela. You and I spoke
back in 1999 about the gas industry. I tried briefly back
in 1999 and found few opportunities during de-regulations
first few steps. Well,...I'm trying again. I've been
applying for a few job openings at Enron and was wondering
if you could give me an internal referral. Also, any advice
on landing a position at Enron or in general as a scheduler
or analyst.
Last week I applied for these positions at Enron; gas
scheduler 110360, gas analyst 110247, and book admin.
110129. I have a pretty good understanding of the gas
market.

I've attached my resume for you. Congrats. on the baby!
I'll give you a call this afternoon to follow-up, I know
mornings are your time.
Regards,

Fritz Hiser

I would like to bid 20 points on Chris Weinke and if I dont get him - i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler

Martin is out today, so he wanted me to sort out the Free Agent situation.  If you could, just send your FA to me by 3 today w/ your bids, and I'll sort through them. 

This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.

phone number -  713-937-4575

I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

I also talked to the manager of the East region scheduling group and he said he would have HR call you for a screening interview, so be ready.  Call me anytime after about 11.

Thanks Tori! I filled out the internal ref. form today.
I'll try to call you tomorrow to follow-up, I've got a few
questions and I'd love to hear your ideas.

Regards,
Fritz

lots of good news out about duke energy -- low p/e -- take a look

Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.  It was good to see y'all again, but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.  I wanted to see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's all.  Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?  I'd love to get in touch with both of them.

get in touch with both of them.

Hey Tom and Nicole -- 
 
I wanted to get in touch with both of you -- I FINALLY got your email addresses.  My little girl - Erin - is almost 4 months old now - and is and absolute joy.  She's a pro a rolling over and grabbing and chewing on everything she can get her hands on.  I wish you guys could see her.  I'm attaching a picture even though it's a little old.

 
After you see this  - I won't have to tell you how much she looks like her daddy.  Life has definitely changed, but for the better.  Believe it or not, I haven't gotten drunk in over a year and have no desire to do so - HA!!  I'm still working at Enron, trading away -- it's still been the best move I ever made.  Pat is now at Waste Management after getting laid off from the little .com company.  Again, a very good turn of events.  We are loving Katy, especially with the swimming pool built in the back yard and some really great neighbors.  
 
Enough about me -- please write back with updates - I feel like I've totally lost touch and I don't want to keep it that way.
 
 
Take Care and talk to you soon,
 
Tori 

Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-

As I said to Kim, I made an error in the total amount of gas we have
purchased for the month of October.  One contract (2500MMBtu/day) ended in
September.  Therefore the total nomination for month of October 2001 is
14,529MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the
following:
 
1. 4,029MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of
1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
 
As before, losses on the PG & E line are unchanged from September 2001 at
2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect,
temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit
(Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during
the month.  During the last few days of September and the first week of
October, we will have our third steam unit Broadway 1 online for testing.
Usage should be up during this time.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.

that date works for me as of now -- and i do have a few things

Hello Friends!

I am contemplating having a driveway sale at our house on Saturday Oct 27th
from like 7:30am-1pm.  People get started early at those things and then it
dies off early afternoon.  I don't have a ton of stuff but thought you guys
might have some things you were looking to get rid of.  I only want to keep
it to this small group of people as i think if we get more than this it
would be too confusing.   

I only have 2 conditions:  if you bring stuff over, you must stay to help
out and sell it.  We could do shifts as we won't need everyone there the
whole time.  But everyone would have to be there at first to set up.
Second, all unsold stuff must be taken with you that afternoon.  

It could be somewhat fun, if we make it that way. The sale would be in our
driveway as i don't want stranger hanging out in our garage.  

Let me know if you are interested in participating.  I will let you know if
the response is positive.

Jennifer

i will be attending the party

Have fun in Port A -- i'll tentatively pencil in the 28th - let me know if something comes up and i will do the same

Hi!

It was good to see ya'll too!

Right now John is getting ready to sail in the Harvest Moon Regatta to Port
Aransas.  I'm headed down there too this weekend (by car!) for the
party...so it looks like this weekend is out.

We have plans on the 14th.  So it looks like we are looking at possibly the
28th.

We'd love to have ya'll out.  Let me check with John for the 28th and I'll
let you know if it is a possibility.

Cathy

Hey Cathy -- just checking in with you.  It was good to see y'all again,
but we'd love to come out to the house sometime in October.  I wanted to
see what your Sundays looked like - we are out on the 19-21 but that's
all.  Also, do you have contact info for Tom and Nicole?  I'd love to
get in touch with both of them.

the seats are in the lowest section - within one of the baselines -i cant really remember what row - they are pretty good though

I went ahead and invited Doug and John.  Doug has accepted but I haven't
heard back from John yet.  If he backs out, I'll ask Mike..  Where are the
seats?

sounds like a good plan -- i guess the best thing to do is follow advice of the experts -- hopefully we will win in the long run

Per Rick and Tom's advice, we made the following "BABY steps" back into the
market:
*	100 shares of TYC (their top stock) at 45ish and
*	We added 2K to each of Mutual funds.

This leaves us with 20K in the money market..

ok - great - sounds good - let me know if you need any more information

Tori,

	I just wanted to give you an update.  We hope to be able to start work on building your report early next week.  We are currently looking at two sources of data and
working with other teams on who can provide us with the best source.  As far as the Canadian prices I did find out we have real-time access to the currency rate so converting
that to US should not provide any issues either.  I'll be in touch early next week.

Thanks,

Dave

I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

 << File: DailyPrices.xls >> 
This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.

hello - i left you a message on your cell phone a month ago - I thought you decided that you didnt want to talk to me or something.  CALL ME -- 713-853-3275.  

Are you out there?

Hey there.  All is well with Erin and with me.  Although I can tell you that I definitely have not had time to pick up a book lately.  Our day consists of -- wake up at 5, feed Erin, get ready, drive to work, work, drive home, feed the baby, eat dinner, play with the baby, bathe the baby, go to sleep -- and I'm really lucky if I'm not awakened at 2 or 3 am.  But, it's ALL worth it.  I would be glad to give you a recommendation -- any idea where you want to be?  There are a few people hiring right now for sure.

Hello Mrs. Kuykendall, hope all is well with you and the baby.  All done with my trip round the world (and got a big boy email account as well now that employers will be looking at it!) and of course i have to go through the dreaded interviewing process to find gainful employment..... just spoke with a head hunter lady who is going to help me find a trading job in gas/power and of course i left her your name as one of my many pristine references.  I left keith's as well.  Hopefully you two are both big swingin' dicks in the industry these days and my potential new employers will swoon over your glowing praise!  For now though i am trapped at my parents' house wasting days doing little other than reading.  Its indian summer here in mass today though so i'm going to get outside before the sun goes down.  Read a couple of good books while i was away, Rich Man Poor Man by Irwin Shaw and Memoirs of a Geisha w! ere both pretty good.  got any recommendations of your own?

Are you out there?

well - the problem is that I have 2 dinners next week and one om the 17th - it's tough to leave pat at home with the baby that many nights -- but we'll see

I'm coming in on the 15th around 12:30pm and leaving at noon on the 17th.
Let me know if you have time for me (beyotch), just kidding.  I'm playing
golf on Monday and I'm sure I'll be at some broker party on Monday and
Tuesday nights - so if you can get out I would love for you to join me, if
not - that's cool.

I'm staying at the Hyatt, but you can always reach me on my cell:

Mike - I need to go to the doctor tomorrow - the only appt I could get was 12 noon and it's in Katy, but I will get back as soon as I can.  I have been having some issues over the past week or so and I really need to get it checked out.

We will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.  

1.  EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.  Janie has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".  We are becoming market framers.  I think Frank Ermis is a pioneer.

2.  Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

Mike

well - the gentleman's package seems a little excessive since it has a manicure and a haircut thrown in.  It looks like if we do the massage and facial only - it would be about $150 total.  The phone number is 713-685-6718.

i dont know him but he's legit - just looked him up.  what job are they calling about?

i just got a call from an enron recruiter.  paul weinberger, you know this guy?

the plan sounds good to me - i think signs are usually enough -- just put a few out at all the possible routes

Hey guys!

Looks like the driveway sale is on for Saturday morning Oct 27th 7am-Noon.
I was thinking if you wanted to bring stuff over to set up we could put it
in the garage on friday night and then you guys could meet at our house
around 645am on Sat. and we can drag it all out in the driveway.  If we wait
to get started setting stuff on tables until sat morning, we would have to
start really early.  I know this is early, but believe me those garage sale
people get started early and by noon things will be dead.

The only request I have is that you label all your stuff and stay to help
sale it.  Depending on the cost, I may put an add in the chronicle.  Or I
may just put a sign out on South Braeswood by the JCC.  What do you guys
think?

Jennifer

works here 

Jennifer mentioned we should all do dinner together once a month.  I think
it's a great idea and would like to commit to the next date.  How about you?
I was looking at Wednesday, November 14th.  This is definitely open to
suggestions.

Thanks!

OK guys - I need help deciding what gift to get for the shower.  Jennifer's
registry can be viewed on the internet at www.babiesrus.com.  I was
thinking we could get her one of the more expensive items since there are 5
of us pitching in.  Susan suggested the 3 way pack n' play portable playard
-- sounded good to me.

Let me know what you think.  My plan is to go pick something up next
weekend.

Thanks.

Suzanne, FYI regarding the music, Susan said you can always switch on a

Classical, etc.--you and Scott probably have the same thing). But, I also

may use; I will take care of this item though, so I can field RSVPs etc.)

Hey there! Hope you all had a great Labor Day Weekend. We sure did.

I wanted to get the ball rolling with Tripp's shower. Below is a list of
action items we will need to do.
1) Let me know if I need to add any items that I may have forgotten.
2) Please sign up for what fancies you. (Keep your receipts and we will

I will resend the list with updates as I get them.

Hello Ladies!

I've talked to all of you and you all have expressed interest in
co-hostessing (if that is a word) Tripp's baby shower. I just wanted to
send
out an initial email to let you know where we are and a date.

*    After perusing a calender and talking with Tripp, the planned date
is Saturday, November 10th. (I know the time between Thanksgiving and New
Years is crazy for everyone and right after New Years is cutting it close
since Tripp is due Jan. 20th plus or minus 2 weeks.)

*    It will be a brunch (11-1ish).

*    Tripp will send me an invitation list around October 1st.

*    At this point, Tripp is undecided on whether it will be just a girls
shower or a couples shower.

*    Tripp is thinking that it may be about 15 people max.

*    The default venue will be my place; however, Susan has offered to
use her place which I may need to take her up on because our living room is
really only good for 10 people max. Susan are you still okay with that?

As we get closer, I will send out a list of things we need to do and let
you
pick what you want to do. Or let me know before then if there is anything

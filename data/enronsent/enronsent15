Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement:

Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  05/15/00

Executed Date:  06/09/00

Counterparty:  Pacific Gas & Electric Company

Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX

ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  

1. DIVISION TRADING.  This counterparty may elect to do additional financial 
trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its 
California Gas Transmission Department.  If the Counterparty does elect to 
trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this 
master agreement.  No other divisions should be approved for any financial 
trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from 
Legal.  However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between 
Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.  All 
payments must be treated separately.  It is critical that the 
PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.

(CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.)

2. Canadian and US Trades:  All financial trades with this counterparty, 
whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this 
master agreement.  THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.

3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  When we open them up to trade online, we need to make 
sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement.  
Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial 
product.

3. ONLINE TRADING:  It is critical that  the above information is captured 
correctly before we can open them up for online trading.  I will verbally 
confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, 
and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal 
approves them to trade online. 

I say let them eat cake!

I'm with Risk Assessment and Control and I'm currently not trading in the 
account.  (It is an old account that was opened before I started at Enron.  I 
haven't traded in it because Enron appears to trade in everything! )  
However, since I have you,  I am currently considering buying some options in 
soybeans. Would this be against Enron policy?  
Thanks,
Frank

I just spoke to John Cameron, the lawyer for the Company and our plan is to 
email him, an associate of his, and Doug Thomas the draft as soon as it is 
ready.    I will also fax John Cameron the draft.   Tracy Ngo in Credit is 
working up the credit, and I am doing as much of the draft as I can pending

reviewing the draft.  As this is moving quickly, please provide us with any

Gentlemen, as we speak Enron's Credit and Legal teams are conversing on the 
best way to approach, either an ISDA or a Long Form Confirm, for "papering" 
the requested financial hedge.  Once Enron Credit is "comfortable" with 
Bellingham Cold Storage (BCS), Legal will prepare the necessary 
documentation, once approved by BCS/John Cameron, I will quote work up some 
July executable numbers and attempt to contact the Robert, Doug, John C.  
This will require everyone's joint efforts in order to accomplish this in 
such a short time line.  BCS and John Cameron should anticipate a call from 
either or Enron's Credit and Legal personnel.  Thanks,  John

   

We need numbers as soon as possible this morning -- also these must be
serious -- not notional.

I am at 771-5090.  I will be available at 784-3758 all day.  My email
follows me around so you can always get me  on email.

	John Malowney
	06/30/2000 10:53 AM
		
Then we pass.... there is no sense going through "yesterdays fire drill" when 
we don't have the necessary "paper" in place in order to execute.  We 
appreciate the interest, next time with a little more forewarning, I'm sure 
Enron will competitively be in the hunt.  Let us know is you'd like us to 
continue working on the necessary contracts for future use.  Thanks, John

   

Clients are hopping up and down -- I am expecting a beer for my loyal
Enron services this week . . .

We have received the following three amendments to the ETA's, as indicated 
below:

Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement 
Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement 
Letter Agreement dated May 31,2000 amending Electronic Trading Agreement 
Copies will be distributed.

We have finally received comments on the ISDA from the referenced 
counterparty.  I have sent copies to each of you.  There were substantial 
comments to the guaranty so I have sent a copy of the guaranty along with the 
comments to Clem.

Clem,  congrats on that trophy!

You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the 
kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.

All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, 
repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, 
including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final 
job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  
I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in 
a construction site.

I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be 
at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for 
getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & 
heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll 
probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!

Keep in touch...!  

John, you can take Shari Stack off these emails.  She is a lawyer working on 
the physical power agreements, our group works on the financial trading 
agreements.  Carol St. Clair is the lawyer working on this master (I'm a 
paralegal).  Thanks.

ENA BA&R is currently in the process of preparing the 12/31/99 financial 
statements to be filed with the NYMEX by July 21st in order to keep our 
trading seat.  These financial statements reflect all of the North America 
trading operations.  ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should 
reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) 
activity.  Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading 
Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity.  
These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review 
and reflect $722MM in earnings.

However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three 
companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal 
owned by ENA.  In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned 
during 1999.  The companies are as follows:

Improperly Included:
ECM Treasury Consolidated  (Company 969)
ECT Retail Services    (Company 1Q6)
ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail  (Company 890)

Improperly Excluded:
Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.    (Company 104)

I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in 
Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if
the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete 
North America trading activity.  These discussions confirmed that the 
Hyperion legal 
structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership.  In 
addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that 
would be
removed from the bottom line.  This activity should probably be reported to 
the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk 
management
activity.

The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements.  We are prepared 
to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where
we can retrieve accurate ledger information.  The other main issue is 
timing.  We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st.  
Before that can
happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several 
departments.

The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order 
to determine the proper activity to report.  As soon as that is determined, 
we can
proceed with data retrieval.

Please contact me if have any questions, concerns or comments.

DT

Your the queen......  thanks for your efforts!!

We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.  We found 
that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so 
frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.  In the long run 
we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as 
the trading markets become more international in nature.  If you prefer the 
Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to 
compare the forms and convert the document over.  Please let me know if that 
is your preference.

Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty 
is the protected party.  This form needs a little tweaking since it is more 
directed for a financing transaction.  Peter can find it, as well as other 
forms, in the attorney forms bank.  Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can 
be of further help.

I spoke to Serge Martin, their outside counsel, and he said it's on his list, 
but he hasn't been able to get to it.  Maybe in another month...

We have received the executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated 
June 28, 2000 wherein Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. ("Assignor") assigned its 
interest in certain natural gas wholesale and derivatives transactions with 
 A copy of the trades being assigned is attached to the assignment which will 
be distributed to the usual distribution group, plus Bob Klein.

I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading 
Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell 
you what a good job he has been doing for our group.

I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we 
have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group 
uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master 
Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the 
database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data 
maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, 
while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the 
online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep 
track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This 
need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with 
online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly 
respond to our client, the online trading group.

Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and 
helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding 
of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful 
while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us 
meet the needs of our clients.

Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a 
valuable asset to your team!

In case you were wondering...

I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced 
counterparty.  I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.  He 
finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for 
a lawyer on his side to review it.  He has one comments already I'll run by

comments.

We have received the executed Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement 
with the referenced counterparty dated May 30, 2000.  Copies will be 
distributed.

Per my conv. w/Carol St. Clair, Crestar commented on the ETA, but never 
requested that their comments be formalized as an amendment.  Per our 
understanding, they have not requested a signed amendment and opened the 
counterparty w/o any changes, so we have not pursued them.

Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from 
Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an 
assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, 
since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the 
books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any 
collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)...

Boy, was she quick.  We appear to have only one trade to assign, so Credit, I 
guess you are OK with this, and Bob, you don't show any other crude trades do 
you?

Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in 
place?  When can we receive copies?

Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.  We have 
the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements:

Limitation of Rate.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained 
in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or 
Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that 
at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, 
charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to 
such party.   For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act 
(Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable 
under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full 
calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a 
fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar 
year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the 
denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. 

Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have 
a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the 
maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of 
days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to 
the above highlighted language?

Thanks for your help.

Narsimha,

The NYMEX may require the aggregation of employees trading with the trades of 
the Company.  Further, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from trading 
any commodities products that the company trades.  Therefore, in the future, 
please do not trade any products the company trades.  If you have any 
questions as to a specific product, please call me at x33399.

Thanks for your email.

As you aleady appear to be aware, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees 
from tading any products the company trades.   As you may or may not be 
aware, the products the company trades has expanded beyond energy 
commodities, we trade interest rates & currencies, pulp & paper, weather, and 
metals.  I am sure this product base will continue to expand.  If you have 
any questions about trading a particular product, please call me at x33399 (I

Robbi,

What impact will the advice below have on our Japanese bandwidth approvals?  
Right now I have them OK to trade the US segment.  Based on the advice below 
do you think we will need to get a license as a "telecommunications 
carrier"?  Should I shut Japan down for now?

Michelle,

I discussed the corporate authorization issue with Mika Suzuki, a Japanese 
lawyer in our office.

1.  Basically, we believe that Japanese corporations can enter into the 
Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement.

     A.  There is no specific internal authorization required in Japanese 
corporate law and practice, unless the transaction is considered 
"important."  Obviously, the question of what is "important" is relative.

     B.  Generally, larger companies have internal directors' rules that 
specify a monetary amount above which transactions must be subject to board 
approval.  Outsiders are usually not privy to that information and, having no 
notice thereof, are not prejudiced by failure of the company to follow its 
own internal approval procedures.  There is case law to support that notion 
with regard to the claims of innocent contract counter parties.

     C.  However, if the counter party has notice that board approval is 
required, but has not been obtained, or the counter party is "negligent" 
(like a constructive notice type of situation) the counter party will not 
have the benefit of any lack of authority argument or defense.

     D.  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a representation 
and warranty regarding due authorization in Section 10.(a)(iv).  Although not 
determinative, this provision should be considered by a Japanese court.

     E.  As the execution of the Master Agreement does not involve a specific 
transaction and transaction amount, it is unlikely that it would fall into 
this "important" matter category requiring board approval.  However, the 
transactions will have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

2.  A.  In the BWT context, if the bandwidth purchaser is not going to use 
the bandwidth itself (i.e., the purchaser plans to re-sell the bandwidth), 
the purchaser will have to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier under 
the Telecommunications Business Law of Japan (the "TBL").

     B.  In order to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier, the general 
rule is that the registered business purpose of the corporation must specify 
that its business purpose is to carry on telecommunications business.  
(Please see the corporate register of the Applications YK and Network YK for 
examples of this.)  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a 
representation and warranty regarding licensing in Section 10.(a)(iii).

     C.  Basically, a violation of the licensing requirement should not 
affect the validity of the contract, but simply result in the bandwidth 
trader becoming subject to the penal provisions of the TBL.  However, one 
should keep in mind that the intention of the TBL is to protect the public 
good and, to the extent that disregard of its licensing requirements in 
connection with BWT might be considered a threat to or undermining of the 
integrity of the telecommunications system, broader regulatory action may be 
a possibility.  In that regard, an action for specific performance of a 
bandwidth delivery obligation by the unlicensed trader may be problematic.

We hope this answers your initial question.

Best regards.

Jeff

>>> <Michelle_Hicks@enron.net> 06/27/00 05:28AM >>>

Jeff,  Here is the latest version of the Master Agreement.  The scope of the
review at this time is limited to whether Japanese companies are authorized to
enter into such an agreement.  I will let you know when or if the traders are
interested in having the form reviewed from a Japanese law perspective.  
Please
let me or Cynthia know if you have any questions or comments.  Best regards,
Michelle

Thanks.  His phone number will be 345-7702 and, as we discussed, he will 
office in 3846.

I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the 
pulp & paper trades to that website.  In oder to determine whether any of the 
counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the 
ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper 
online.  Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?

Thanks!

Re: the Statoil Assignment

The Statoil master will not be terminated. They sold their existing natgas & 
crude oil book to J. Aron.  They may trade other products out of that master, 
or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those 
products.  So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under 
the J. Aron master.  Everything else should remain the same.

You would need to talk to Mike Moscosco.  I don't know, but perhaps they 
don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.

SECOND REQUEST

Tana,

I was hoping that you could answer a question for me. 

I have a copy of a NYMEX approval letter dated June 5, 2000 plus the 
interoffice memorandum
detailing the increase of Henry Hub Natural Gas positions from 17,000 to 
20,000.  They state that
this is in regards to the July ONLY contract.

However, the ECT generated report for Limits (the report Moscoso's group 
creates) dated June 19, 2000 
doesn't show this increase under the "Delivery Month Limit Amount" column for 
July NG contracts.
In turn,  the red flag, "approaching limit", pops up on the 21st.  This is 
b/c  the limit is still at 17,000 instead
of 20,000; the red flag probably wouldn't have popped up if the limit had 
been raised.  

Tell me your thoughts.

Thank you so much for all of your help.
If you have any questions please give me a call, x31684.

Sincerely, 

Jack Ehrig

Gene,

As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect 
to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project 
Services Agreement in Enron's files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, 
one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot 
sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original 
agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.?

I am working with the Click Paper.com lawyers on their online documentation, 
and they want to see a UK form of financial GTC.  Can you send me one?

As ever, in your debt...

Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.

My apologies for not including the attachment earlier.

Richard and I believe we have finalized the descriptions for these Products. 
Please find attached our suggested final version. Our projected roll-out date 
is next Wednesday, so I will commence the building process ASAP.

Dale

Item 1 - Agreed; see my Revision Marks.

Item 2 - How about listing the Contract Price as the difference between the 
Bid and Offer; see my Revision Marks.

Also, are you suggesting we change the Product Short Descriptions to what you 
have placed in bold? If so, then your Product Short description on the 
website will be redundant, and look like this:  

Chicago Phy Gas Park Chi Peoples 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM; 

and if you ever wanted to offer another Product based on a different Location 
it would be messy:

Chicago Phy Gas Park Mich Con 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM, 

so we would have to build another Product Type. I think that it's important 
to leave the Product Type generic (i.e. 'US Gas Phy Loan') which would allow 
you to transact on other locations (i.e. US Gas Phy Loan   Mich Con  20Jun00 
-Jul00 USD/MM; or US Gas Phy Loan   Demarc  20Jun00 -Jul00 USD/MM) and we can 
set those up quickly and easily.

I would really like to get these last issues finalized as quickly as 
possible. Building the Product Type is easy; chasing everyone down to get 
their part done is where I start running into time delays.

I have changed the Product description again, but I think that this will be 
the final change.  Please review the Product example worksheet for a detailed 
examples of how I think these products will work.  

Dale,

I have modified your long product description for both the Park and the Loan 
products.  Hunter and I have reviewed your description and we have the 
following comments:

1.  We should ensure that both "legs" of these transactions are firm.  
Currently only the "payback" portion of the transaction is labeled as firm.

2.  Do we need to state the Contract price is the difference between the 
sales and purchase price.  I will make my market based on these prices, but 
there are many other factors that will effect my actual bids/offers. 

Additonally, we are still waiting for product manager set-up on our 
computers; although, we have been approved for these products by security.  
Thanks

is Gladiator.  This is major!  I had no idea you were in the biggest hit of 
the summer, and probably the year.  How will I know which barbarian is you?  
Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for

Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for 
you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...

Tana,  could you do me a massive favour and arrange for the below referenced 
ISDA faxed over to me. Thanks, Ed

Edmund,

Gordon Boozer at Swiss Re has suggested that we use the existing ISDA
Master Agreement between Swiss Re and ENA as a template for the
EnronCredit.com Schedule.  Denis and I agree that this is a reasonable
approach, provided that we carve-out any business / reps / credit terms
peculiar to ENA.  I should be grateful if you would send me a copy of the
ENA-Swiss Re Schedule by e-mail / fax (0207 330 9999) at your earliest
convenience.

Many thanks,

James

 Subject Re: Bank ISDA credit
 :

________________________________________

On point 2. below, I would leave this blank for the moment and add in a
later draft. Thanks, Edmund

Edmund,

Two further questions:

1.  Automatic Early Termination.  The Policies and Concessions Guidelines
table indicates that AET should be applied / disapplied in accordance with
the recommendations contained in the ISDA netting opinions, as summarised
by the matrix recently provided to Enron by Cathy Ryan.  However, where the
matrix indicates that AET is "Recommended", but is not "Necessary", what do
you want us to specify?

Please note that generally we think that Automatic Early Termination should
not apply unless there is some legal advantage in including it (ie. where
local counsel has indicated that it is necessary/strongly recommended in
order to enforce close-out netting under the particular insolvency rules
applicable to the counterparty).  This is because there are practical
disadvantages associated with it.  The main disadvantages are:

(a)  the fact that it cannot be waived by the Non-defaulting Party, which
therefore loses its discretion as to whether and        when to terminate;
and

(b)  the risk that Early Termination will occur without the knowledge of
the Non-defaulting Party.

As  far  as  we  are  aware,  Automatic Early Termination is currently only
necessary  in  relation  to counterparties located in Denmark. As a result,
you  may  wish  to  consider  disapplying  Automatic  Early  Termination in
relation to counterparties in all other jurisdictions.  Please note that we
understand  that Automatic Early Termination is recommended (although it is
not  necessary) for counterparties located in Singapore, Switzerland, Japan
and the Netherlands.   As a result of these recommendations, you may prefer
that   Automatic  Early Termination continues to apply.  Please let me know
how  you  would  like  me  to  revert  to proceed in the first draft of the
Schedules where AET is recommended, but not necessary..

2. Date of the Agreement.  I should be grateful if you would provide us
with details of the date of the first trade for each counterparty where
EnronCredit.com Limited has an existing trading relationship with the
counterparty.  If we have not received this information before the first
draft Schedules and cover faxes are ready for distribution, then we will
add these details in a later draft.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks,

James

Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in 
detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of 
the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment 
policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk 
management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price 
volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."

Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there 
any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that 
language?

Attached is the language for insertion in the confirmation.

I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest 
change question we asked him.  You'll see, he sent us both a fax with 
proposed changes to that section.

When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.  It wasn't a 
clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on 
this.

John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in.   I take it 
that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?  Our usual sample form does not 
have the governmental provisions.  I would think we would want to send them a 
sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised 
if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional 
provisions in there.  Can you confirm for me that they are a 
governmental/quasi-governmental?  Also, have you requested credit from 
Credit?

Please handle the ISDA portion.  If there is no commercial pressure, and I 
don't think I have ever seen these guys do a finanical trade, the priority is 
probably pretty low.

Thanks,

Per email below, counterparty would like to put some masters in place with

you send me an email back.  Thanks.

Susan,

I am working with Joe Hunter to prepare the individual letters to our 
counterparties
for the below detailed project.   In order to fill in the blanks in the first 
paragraph
of Carol's template, it is necessary for me to know the appropriate section 
in 
each counterparty's Agreement that references the existing confirmation 
procedures 
(the "Confirmation Procedures").

Would it be possible for you to provide me with copies of the Master 
Agreements
for each of the following counterparties, so I can fill in the blanks and get 
these letters
out the door:

Bank One (formerly FNB)
Bankers Trust Company
Barclays Bank PLC
The Chase Manhattan Bank
Citibank, N.A.
Credit Suisse Financial Products
Elf Trading S.A
J.Aron & Company
Paribas
Phibro Inc.
Royal Bank of Canada

I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.

Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.
-Diane
  

Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we 
could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations.  
This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those 
counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments 
on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks.

There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being 
a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after 
filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal 
laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other 
type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.   
It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a "dba"  
(which means "doing business as") or "assumed name" for an incorporated 
entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade 
under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us 
some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not 
understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or 
there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being 
aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as 
part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples 
might be "Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division" or "Tana 
Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company" or "TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones 
Inc."  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a 
division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to 
talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their 
trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit 
should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's 
master.  

P.S. Susan Flynn is on an extended leave of absence.

Tana,

I'm hoping you can clarify some information I received second-hand on 
Cargill, Incorporated, and Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, 
Incorporated.   It is my understanding that Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, is allowed to trade under the ISDA (contract  
96043502) between Cargill, Incorporated and ENA.   Based on the information 
in the Legal Financial Trading Agreement database, there is no information to 
indicate that this affiliate is also covered by the Cargill, Incorporated 
master .  Also, the email from Susan Flynn  does not include any information 
on additional parties covered under this contract.  Finally, Part 4(b) of the 
schedule to the agreement specifies that for Section 10(c) of the contract , 
neither party is a multibranch party.  This is all the information that 
Anthony Campos has received to date on this contract.  Based on this 
information, and from previous requests from Legal for Global Contracts to 
refer any interpretations to Legal, the Global Contracts group could not make 
any assumptions regarding other counterparties not specifically listed on the 
contract or schedules.  

I wanted to verify if what I had heard about Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, was correct and to obtain the pertinent documentation 
if so.  Also, does Legal have any specific "policies" regarding affiliate 
relationships?  Is there any documentation we should have been aware of?

I just want to make sure that there are no EOL issues in the future and that 
we have not misinterpreted any information.  Please let me know how Legal 
handles such an issue and what actions Global Contracts can expect.

As usual, thanks for you help and patience.

Deb,

Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North 
America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is 
not showing up on the list.

Thanks!

In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)

Bill,  I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need 
to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out...
	Deb Korkmas

Per our conversation, attached is the Authorized Trader List.  Can you have 
Gary review it Monday when he gets back, as we are opening a new brokerage 
account and we need to provide the list to the brokerage firm.

Do you have any updates to the Pulp & Paper group?

Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?  If it's not a rush, it 
makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like 
"this is not negotiable!".

Hi Tana,

To answer your questions 

1. The companys full name is NatSource LLC
2. I'm not sure but it should be exactly the same as what we sent to True 
Quote, Houston Street and Espeed.
3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
Platform.
4. The companys address is 
Nat Source LLC 
140 Broadway
30th Floor, New York
NY 10005
It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335, 
fax-212-232-5354) Their General Counsel is Andrew O Connor (tel 
212-286-1234). Andy Zipper will sign the document before it is sent.
5. Its not a rush we're just starting to talk to them.

I hope this gives you all the information you need. Thanks a lot. 

Savita

I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the 
counterparty.   If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I 
am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.

1.  Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of 
Enron Power Marketing  (this would have covered physical power, not 
financial).

I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of 
ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is 
taken care of.

Brent Hendry, an attorney that used to be in our group in Houston, then went 
to Argentina, is now back.  He had review only access to the Master Swap

customers that were on our initial mailout and need to go thru the approval

trades, therefore, I will need to immediately send them their user ids.

We need to set up a new database as soon as possible when you get back.  We 
have a new online trading system starting Tuesday, ClickPaper.com, and I will 
need to mirror the Online Trading Database.

Can you call me when you get back.

Attached is the referenced list.  I understand that the Western Area Power 
Administration - Upper Great Plain has been bugging us to get opened up for 
physical power, so you might want to give a rush approval on that one.

No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title 
of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.  You have two on the 
7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and 
Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United 
States Department of Energy.  Can you please change the name on the 
accounts.  I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for 
divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name 
on to the account.   The people who approve Password Applications should be 
sorting this out.

Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.  Thanks.

FYI.

Please note that we are in a dispute with Enage Energy US, LP with respect to 
power trading, and they are shut down for power trading only until such 
dispute is resolved.  I have already confirmed this with Stephanie.

Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration 
for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm 
interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to 
call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the 
fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford 
their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron 
web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that 
they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.

In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our 
own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the 
project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some 
software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for 
document creation more attractive.

Thanks Mike!

We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank 
that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International 
Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA,  
effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.  We do have an ISDA Master 
Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.

I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am 
also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).  We will await Credit's 
instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the 
documentation.

At the request of Bill Bradford in our Credit Department, I am attaching our

I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National 
Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put 
in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 
Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2. The contact is Theresa Pace (French 
pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.  I spoke to Harry Arora about it, 
and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on 
vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.  So when you 
have a minute, let's talk about what to do.

Hi Edmund,

I was told that you are still working on the due dilligence for selling 
metals to Japan.
MG would like to know how long it will take until we can trade metals with 
our Japanese friends as we will (hopefully) introduce a 
Phy. Al contract, CIF Japanese port basis. soon.
One of their guys will go to Japan soon to 'promote' it.

Any idea ?

Mark,

I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who 
your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, 
and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to 
see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.  
I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your 
direction as to how I should handle this.

I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone 
number is 713/853-3399.  

I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to 
add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list 
Credit sent me).  One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical 
power.  Like the other European based physical power products, it should not 
be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be 
marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut 
down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a 
particular one).  Is that OK with you.

Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit 
opened them up for all financial power).  I had already opened them up for 
all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval.

Attached is the referenced list.  There are only 2 counterparties for 
approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.

Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add 
financial power.  I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with 
the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products 
with utilities under Virginia law.  Notes in our database reflect that this 
was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.  I 
have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to 
resolve this directly with them.

Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas 
Company, and that needs to be made part of the name.

I still need to see you about that Market Disruption summary for the Husky 
Oil Global Contract Datasheet so I can close up that file.

At the request of Andy Zipper, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any 
comments or questions.  

Alan & Harry

Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has 
a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the 
two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the 
business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you 
the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know.

Tana - Attached is the file of customers who have been approved by Tom Moran 
in credit for Clickpaper.  Please review from a Legal standpoint and let us 
know which ones legal approves.

Camille, Jarrod - The file below is in O:/P&P/Clickpaper/PCG .  I think we 
should save these as we receive them back from all checks.  Also, Tom has 
declined TFS but we should have them set up w/ a Global Counterparty ID.  The 
company already set up in GCP as TFS is actually a Singapore company so I do 
not think it is the same one.  Please fax the registration to Mary Gosnell.  
We can then register TFS in Clickpaper w/ a "guest id".  You will also need 
to update Jarrod's daily registration report that he is preparing for the 
traders and check w/ Bob before sending back a "Reject" letter to these that 
Tom has declined - Bob may want to set up a "guest id" for them.

Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Michelle

Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp. was originally shut down for 
financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down 
all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.  Since then, 
we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental 
utilities.

Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp. (and moved 
the Aquila trades under it).

Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp. for all financial products.

The referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical 
and financial products offered online.  I am not sure if we need to see this 
counterparty come through again as a Click Paper counterparty or not.  I'll 
let Tom decide.   For me, I'm OK.

David,

A clarification...

On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they 
should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other 
products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally 
and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a 
correct interpretation?

	David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	07/25/2000 06:01 PM
		
Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is 
fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral 
requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we 
do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These 
are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not 
linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading 
Australian power and weather.

Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and 
weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to 
trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to 
check this one out further.      

  

Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the 
US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for 
power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.
	Frank L Davis

Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the 
Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these 
products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY 
appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious 
lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help.

Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!

Frank

Hi Marc,

Tana Jones from our legal department  just called me and said that before I
sent Wesley Fredricks information over to her, Andrew O Connor returned her
phone call and is now expecting the document from us. You may receive an
email from her to try to sort this out. Thanks a lot.

Savita

I maybe mistaken but I think Jack had given me the name of Andrew O Connor

Fredricks is the person we need to sen it to. Please let me know.

product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the 
information.  Thanks.

Try talking to Nadeem Tufail in London.  I believe he is a paralegal that is 
responsible for their corporate filings.

Leslie,

On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy 
Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.  I have no record on 
PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even 
though it says amended.  Thanks.

Attached is the referenced list.  I am still waiting on 1 response for the 
list from the 24th.

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated 7/26/00.  Copies will be sent to Andy Zipper and a copy to 
Dave Samuels for the files.

Mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a Confidentiality 
Agreement for the Houston Chronicle.  What's the scoop there?

Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.

The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the 
ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to 
do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions."   
In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA 
Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types 
of products they are approved to do with us.

Anthony, I have no idea what that questions means...

	Anthony Campos

Tana,

In light of recent decisions regarding EOL procedures, your assistance in 
answering the following questions is requested.  Since the new products are 
already being traded, I would appreciate your answers at your earliest 
convenience.

Thank You,

Should EOL copy existing Financial Master contracts into the new financial 
product categories?
Where a previous contract restriction exists, should EOL copy existing 
Financial Master contracts into those previously restricted financial 
categories or leave the category blank without a Financial Master?

I forgot one thing.  I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the 
garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or 
whatever it is, and then painting that.  Do you remember?

By the way, I can't believe you're alive.  By the way you've been quiet, I

ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

In addition, we will need the following closing documents:   Certificate of 
Incumbency.

Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, attached is our form of Letter of Credit.

Holly,

Having both of them included in the certificate will be fine.  Frequently, 
companies do not know who will be available to sign, so they list more than 
one signer.

Thank you, we will use your form to satisfy Schedule to Master Agreement,
Part 3 -evidence of authority and specimen signatures (OK?) BCS would like
either Doug or Stew Thomas to be able sign the ISDA, depending on who is
available at the time. I assume I can simply include both of their names,
titles and signatures in this Certificate. Is this OK?  Thanks for your
help.

We have received and executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   April 28, 2000

Counterparty:   Kinder Morgan, Inc.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp

Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.  It 
appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any, 
has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that 
contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this 
counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial

utilized.  Tana, maybe this could go as an optional insert under Docs to be 
Delivered, rather than back in the collateral schedule with the pv/pdp 
language, so people won't forget to put it in under required deliveries.  
Thanks.  Mary

That's the point, it wasn't on my list!  I remembered when I was standing 
there looking at the garden and saw the rotted board.  Also, there is a 
skootch of repainting that needs to be done on the same garage wall.

You didn't tell me the bathroom you were working on for your other "client"

Dale, could you please forward to John and me a copy of the EOL U.S. weather 
derivatives GTCs and long descriptions for swaps and options so that they can 
be looked at for Japan?

By way of background, the traders in Japan (Jonathan Whitehead, Morten-Erik

through Enron Japan Corp. in lieu of Enron Australia as the Enron 
counterparty, beginning the end of August 2000.

As we will need to change the Enron counterparty for Japanese weather to

I can begin the process of amending same to conform to Japanese 
law/practice.   I believe this will be better than attempting to modify the 
Australian GTC's.

Leslie Hansen is going to review your NDA.  Her number is x36121.

Been a while since we have done one of these, but here's a new one.  This 
will need to be bilateral because they are going to divulge information about 
how they structure their business of supplying sports games over the internet.

Please let me know if this is acceptable with a reasonable amount of change 
or if we should send them our draft.

thanks
Dave

Dave - here's the NDA draft.  Pls send back any changes your legal has to
make.

Thanks!

 - Enron Online NDA 1 Aug 00.doc

I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement on the gas side to see what you've 
done before.  Debbie Brackett says she knows what agreement you're talking 
about.  I'll keep you posted.

Fix all!  I need to tell Peter and Nancy when you'll be in their apartment.

Carol,

Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.  It is not clear 
to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK.  
It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.  What 
do I need to do here?

Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some 
hand marked changes.  Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should 
sign?

Hope all is going well...

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

With respect to your inquiry as to whether there was any assignment executed 
with respect to the assignment of the Howard trades to TXU, I looked in the 
file and it appears that Susan Bailey in our Group prepared an Assignment and 
Termination Agreement which she passed on the Brant Reves in Credit on 1/6/00 
for handling.  There is no record of this assignment ever being executed in 
our records.

I looked thru the attached 10K for NSTAR and could find no "NSTAR Companies" 
entity listed there.  Maybe you'll have better luck, or are smarter and will 
find it (since I failed so miserably on you know what today!).

Yes, you can fax me the invoice and statement.

Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

7/31/00 List - I am not opening up Equitable Gas Company, because it does not 
say a division of Equitable Resources Inc.  I thought that was our deal.
8/1/00 List- I cannot review NSTAR Companies yet.  There is some question as 
to whether that is a correct legal entity.

Anyone know anything about this?

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

All's I need now is your email w/instructions.

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with Spear, Leeds & 
Kellogg dated July 31, 2000.  A copy will be sent to John Pavetto and to Dave 
Samuels for the files.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 04/18/00 amending the 
Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies will 
be distributed.

I will redo the 7/31/00 list with the Equitable approval.

Tana,

With regards to the division issue- we(Product Control) don't necessarily 
know that a company is a division until we receive the profile from credit.  
We then request a new PA from the company with the division language added.  
We make sure that we receive the corrected PA before we send out the password 
and user ID.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Credit wants to open up the referenced counterparty immediately.  They are 
approved to trade all physical products, except physical power, and can trade 
all financial.  I will follow up with this counterparty profile on today's 
approvals.

Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July.

Yes, I would still like to do a movie.  We are running 2 hours and 15
minutes in the morning so I don't know what time I will be finished.  What
is your plan for running?

I don't need to spend a lot of time looking at the house, I just want you to
have a look.  I would get to do all new landscaping so I am thinking about
digging up plants at my house and putting them in pots before my property is
sold.

You for sure can't do it right after work??

I need to run to the bank.  I will be right back.

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   July 28, 2000

Counterparty:   Bellingham Cold Storage Co.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of:  
Foreign Exchange

Bob,

John Viverito, an attorney from Houston who is temporarily in Japan setting 
up our Japanese trading office, is looking for the templates for 
confirmations for US weather and pulp and paper confirmations.  Can you send 
the confirmations to him.  Thanks!
	Alan Aronowitz
	08/04/2000 06:24 PM
		
John:

I will see what I can put together on this. 

I will likely be able to line up OTC and On-line confirmation examples for US 
weather (you, of course, can get Australian weather from David Minns) and 
pulp & paper derivatives only, as metals and lumber are brand new to Enron 
and are being developed as we speak.

Regards, Alan

Tana: Could arrange to have John sent by e-mail examples of the Houston 
over-the-counter and on-line confirmations for weather derivatives and pupl & 
paper?

	John Viverito@ENRON
	08/04/2000 12:20 AM
		
Alan-

Sorry for not being more specific.  Please have our form confirmation 
documentation sent regarding these different commodities, so that we may 
establish a form file here in Tokyo.  It is also anticipated that our 
counterparties will be interested in reviewing the confirmations.  

Thanks,

John

	Alan Aronowitz@ECT
	08/03/2000 09:35 AM
		
John:

It is my understanding that the ISDA documentation previously provided to you 
and B&M is the documentation that we use for the other types of derivatives 
you mentioned. Of course, the transactional confirmations are customized to 
adopt the proper indices for the commodities being hedged.

Alan

	John Viverito@ENRON
	08/02/2000 05:58 AM
		 
All-

IBJ is interested in entering into a ISDA documentation with us for the 
purposes of  trading weather derivatives, pulp & paper derivatives, oil 
derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals.  Our credit department is now 
preparing a credit work sheet, so that the relevant credit language can be 
prepared.  I will contact B&M to discuss on Thursday.

Alan-

Please forward electronic copies of our standard documentation related to 
pulp & paper derivatives, oil derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals (to 
the extent there is any difference from what Marcus has already forwarded to 
B&M), for the purpose of developing such documentation for the Japanese 
market.  

Cheers,

John

Yes, the only weather representations we need are now always covered in the 
confirmation.  As far as thru what entity they trade, I support whatever 
Lotus Notes says.

	Brent Hendry@ENRON
	08/07/2000 09:05 AM
		
There does not appear to be anything that would prevent us from trading 
weather derivatives under this master.  There is a weather represenation that 
should be added to the confirmations but other than that there are no other 
modifications that I know of.  (Tana please let me know if I am wrong.)  Just 
as an aside I noted in the database that it appears that a little over a year 
an a half ago the cp wanted to do all physical and finanacial trading through 
Hess Energy Services Company LLC.  Did anything come of this?  I do not 
believe a master was signed for this entity.  I just want to confirm that 
Hess Energy Trading Company LLC is the active trading entity.

Thanks,
Brent

	Tanya Rohauer@ECT
	08/04/2000 03:59 PM
		 
Brent,  we have an ISDA with this company (executed early 1998).  Does it 
need any modifications in order to trade weather derivatives under it?  I'm 
not sure if the standard ISDA works or if it  needs an amendment for special 
weather definitions.  I am assuming you are handling weather based on your 
handling the new weather/insurance/transformer stuff...if not, please pass 
along to whomever is handling.  Thanks so much for your help.

Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers 
would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative 
authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if 
they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one 
of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.

Dear All

This is just a quick note to let you know that I will be leaving Enron next 
Friday to return to New Zealand in order to enjoy an extra summer and to 
study a bit more law.

I'll be around until Friday 6th August should you have anything specific you 
would like me to deal with, but Michael Slade will now be dealing with all of 
my files. Michael has joined us from Covington & Burling and can be contacted 
on 0171 970 7433 or at mslade@enron.co.uk.

Thanks to all of you for your assistance and advice over the past few years, 
it has been a pleasure working with you.

Kindest regards,
Sasha

We have a new paralegal starting in our group today, Stephanie Panus.  Can 
you get her full access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  Thanks!

Below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes.  
Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving).  
Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need 
to know where they are located.

understanding?

	Brent Hendry@ENRON

When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option 
Exemption representation then I think we should include it in the confirm. Is 
this feasible?

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

Tana,

Thanks for the redlined version. I have a number of concerns about this 
document. I'm not sure who is handling in Carol's absence?

- 2(g): If Offers are warranted by Enron, then what are we warranting? I'm 
not comfortable with this.
- 3(a): The Master Agreement does not control. The Long Descriptions need to 
override the Masters where required. This is common practice OTC.
- 3(d): I don't understand why we are amending this.
- 4(a): This is probably OK, but it doesn't sit right - would appreciate some 
legal comments.
- 5(c): Why are we changing this?
- 6(b): We do not do reciprocal assignments. If they don't like who we assign 
to, they can cease using the system.
- 6 (h): I think some words are missing here.

It looks like there are changes on this against the online ETA which are not

Sorry for the delay, I've been away from the office sick.  

In response to your note:

UK = fine
Sweden = fine  (need to check the authority of persons executing PAs and ETAs)
France = fine.  Need to check on the type of entity to ensure close-out 
netting is possible
Italy = restricted at the moment.  We have sought further advice.  Will 
update in due course.
Netherlands = swaps only at the moment for financials.  This may change.

We have not done any due diligence for physical transactions, so the above 
only relates to cash settled commodity derivatives.

Edmund

I've got  several European counterparties on my 8/3/00 ClickPaper Online 
List, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and France.  Are there any 
restrictions on trading financial pulp & paper in Europe?

Everything going well...?

Attached is the referenced list.  Please note the following:

James Hardie N.V. is a Netherlands counterparty.  They can enter into swap 
transactions only, no options.  As we expand the product list, we will have 
to note this.
Societe Industrielle de Transports Automobile:  I have them shut down for now 
until I speak to the London office tomorrow about bankruptcy/setoff issues in 
France.

Ed,

Please talk to Tana Jones and see if she can get the ball rolling to finalize 
the assignment amendment that is on Carol St.Clair's desk.  Basically, I 
spoke with Vangie last week, and we agreed to make the effective date of the 
assignment JUNE 12, 2000.  That's the last issue at hand.  Please have Tana 
(or other legal person) insert the date, get it executed accordingly, and fax 
a copy of the signature back to Vangie at Merchant.  Vangie's number is 
410-295-1719.  Please ask for her fax number if you don't have it or can't 
find it.  [ this assignment is what Christopher Smith worked on with 
Vangie...it pertains to gas and financial trades ]

FYI, last week Vangie forwarded to me the second assignment batch pertaining 
to power deals.  I'll look at this.

Thanks,
Tracy
Tana:
This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they 
needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they 
wanted us to sign.  The papers should be in my office.  Call me at home if 
you have any problems.

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the

previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is

is 26316. 
Thanks.
Camille

Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties.  
Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I 
have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the 
computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and 
paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing 
thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling 
people without my systems in place!
	Tana Jones
	07/24/2000 03:03 PM
		
Attached is my list with the approvals from Legal filled in.  As I mentioned 
Friday, we will need to keep track of any trading restrictions on a going 
forward basis, because it might impact approval of new online pulp & paper 
products.  Two of the counterparties on this initial list fall into that 
category.  ConAgra Energy Services, Inc. cannot enter into option 
transactions.  We currently have none online, so it's not an issue, but if we 
add options, this would not be allowed.  Second, The E.W. Scripps Company is 
allowed to trade 48.8 gram newsprint only transactions.  We do not currently 
trade 48.8 gram newsprint.

My database will track this, so to add new products online, the counterparty 
should come back through as an amendment, so I can catch it.  Does this make 
sense to you?

Tana, Karen-
I am currently working on the ClickPaper.com project and am responsible for 
the Product Control Group.  Attached from Tom is a list of about 100 
customers that were on our initial mailout and need to go thru the approval 
process soon.  However, below is a list of 4 customers that we need to focus 
on immediately - we would like to approach these customers to do our first 
trades, therefore, I will need to immediately send them their user ids.  
Irving Pulp & Paper Limited
ConAgra Energy Services, Inc.
Inland Paperboard & Packaging, Inc.
Waste Management, Inc.

I appreciate your help in this matter.
Thanks,

With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending 
my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into 
newsprint swaps and options only.  At this time our list does not reflect the 
individual products you are trading.  I understand from Mark Taylor that he 
spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add 
the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as 
this one will occur from time to time.
	Tana Jones
	07/27/2000 10:21 AM
		 
Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.

At Mark Taylor's direction, I have revised the Bilateral Confidentiality 
Agreement form to add a new Paragraph 2 with respect to keeping the 
discussions confidential.  A copy is attached for your files.

Attached are the referenced lists.  A few things to note:

On the 8/7/00 List:

Papier Masson, LTEE can transact all pulp and papers swaps, but not options 
(when we have them).

On the 8/8/00 List:

Globe Building Materials, Inc. has been shut down from trading financial 
since they are currently not an eligible swap participant ("ESP") in their 
own right.  However, getting a letter of credit in place would make them an 
ESP, and Credit has requested a letter of credit from them.  As soon as they 
receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for 
re-approval.

On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended 
counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new 
counterparty.

On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read:  
City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read 
Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.

I just wanted to confirm that your records show the referenced counterparty 
closed for power...?

therefore, we are not prepared to sign that.

Hope that helps.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to 
identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.  The 
City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of 
Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are 
the City of Huntsville, AL.  This isn't going to be a problem with my 
financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have 
a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.  The same would apply 
to counties.

So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of 
the counterparty name.

1.  What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?  I think that should be 
"Credit Derivatives".

2.  Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list, 
since I never have any responses from those groups.

3.  I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with 
limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.

4.  Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for 
"EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".  I will maintain my approvals for each of 
those separate online trading databases in the same database.

5.  I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".

Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush 
from last week done....

As usual, your help is always appreciated!

With respect to the attached list, a few things:

1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are 
approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know 
if your approvals reflect otherwise?

2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA 
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set 
the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading 
arm, so that entity name should be left alone.

Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets 
when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?  For online, what I 
daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading 
legal groups.  Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I 
will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's 
list.  I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties.  
Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction 
being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens 
to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).   I 
understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process 
may get more complex.

Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do 
you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you? 

Can you put this on my calendar.  Thanks.

Good Morning Everyone,

The Swap Group will hold a Forms Meeting to discuss potential form changes to 
our financial trading forms on:

Date:  Thursday, August 17th

Time:  10:30 a.m.

Location: Conference Room   EB38C1

Susan S. Bailey

Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's 
ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a 
governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group 
where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained 
to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the 
relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative 
transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any 
relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to 
obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring 
outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not 
have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will 
not be approving them to trade financial products.

As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check 
with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US 
eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain 
vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm 
or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to 
trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are 
a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.

If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet 
a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily 
inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet 
this test.  At your direction I will handle this in this manner.  How would 
you like me to proceed?
 

	David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	08/16/2000 07:58 PM
		
Is this an incorporated entity? I assume its authority to trade a range of 
products has been checked out? In Australia this assumption can not be made 
for government  entities

Under our licencing requirements we need to make reasonable enquiries that a 
counterparty has (or is guaranted by someone who has) atleast USD6 million in 
assets. Can this assumption be made?         

Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.

The online team called and they would like a rush approval for Duke Energy 
Merchants LLC.  In particular, this counterparty would like to trade European 
physical coal.  Please let me know as soon as possible whether you have any 
problems with this counterparty.

Just to keep you in the loop on things.  Lee sent me the following email and 
I'm following up trying to figure this out.  I spoke to Debbie Brackett in 
our Credit Dept. when I got back from London and she seemed to be aware of 
the contract Lee has been talking about.  I'm trying to get a copy of the 
agreement from Debbie so I can figure this out.  I'll keep you posted.

I am sorry that I was unable to meet you whilst you were in London and I 
guess we had some unfinished business with regard to the United Gas / 
Utilicorp Co-signature issue.

I have now found the e-mail that I had previously sent to Houston with regard 
to the inability of certain US entities, including Utilicorp, to issue a 
guarantee for overseas entities unless they obtain FERC and the state 
regulators approval beforehand.

United gas have now changed their name to Aquila Energy Ltd and are looking 
to expand in to power in the UK as well as gas and power throughout Europe. 
Therefore, I expect our level of business is likely to increase in the near 
future.

It is now even more important that we either obtain a guarantee from 
Utilicorp, or, ensure that if Utilicorp co- sign any agreement that it is 
enforceable.

I would be very grateful if you could 

a) confirm that it is not possible for Utilicorp (and for that matter 
Entergy) top parent  to issue a parent company guarantee without obtaining 
authorisation form various regulatory bodies. 

b) that obtaining the signature of an authorised officer of Utilicorp on each 
agreement (or master) is enforceable.

Please feel free to give me a call on 44 171 316 6755 if you would like to 
discuss further.

Many thanks 

Lee
Lee Munden

Many thanks.

You are correct, it does have something to do with the international 
operations only. 

The way Entergy explained the situation, there was some sort of Act 'The 1935 
Public Utility Holding Company Act -section 53 or 58 I believe -   which says 
that you have to be own adjacent utilities (adjacent States?) to be able to 
issue guarantees in respect of international operations (very strange!).

In other words, if the company owns utilities that are not in adjacent 
states, as is the case of 'Entergy', then the utility has to segregate their 
business between domestic and non domestic business, thus the domestic assets 
cannot be used as security / guarantee for the international assets.

Whilst I do not have any reason to doubt what Entergy say, I would like some 
confirmation that there is no way to by-pass this Act. Is there someone in 
legal Houston that you could run this by?

Appreciate your help.

Many thanks and regards 

Lee

Lee,

I have no knowledge of any regulatory reasons why Entergy Corp can not 
provide the guaranty.  We have a guaranty from Entergy Corp. covering Entergy 
Power Marketing Corp.  Perhaps it has something to do with international 
operations only.  

Let Kelly, Tracy or I know if you need any details on the existing guaranties 
or any help talking with Entergy in the U.S.

I am currently talking to Entergy Trading & Marketing Ltd in the UK with 
regard to both physical gas sales and financial power trades.

I have requested a Parent Company Guarantee from Entergy Corp but have been 
advised that this in not available due to regulatory reasons but they are 
prepared to provide a guarantee from Entergy Power Development Corp which 
holds their overseas generation assets.

Whilst the proposed guarantor has some degree of financial substance, it 
would only support restricted short term trades and as this entity is not 
rated, does not lend itself easily to MAC language in the contract.

I would be grateful if you could confirm whether there are such regulations 
that would prevent Entergy Corp from providing us with a guarantee to support 
this UK entity.

Many thanks 

Lee 

Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd 
be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact 
Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they 
have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll 
keep you posted.

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  

I heard back from the coal lawyers.  Duke is approved to trade all coal.

Mark Taylor just heard that Edmund is very sick and has been out for quite 
awhile.  What's the scoop?  Is he in the hospital, will he continue to be 
out, is there someplace we can send flowers?  Can you let me know what's 
going on.  Thanks!

Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather 
online.  However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only 
covers energy commodities.  I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and 
he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the 
master agreement.   I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going 
to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.

So, they are OK to open for weather. 

Can you please have the Password Application amended to set up the 
counterparty as I have indicated.  Then tell Global Contracts it is done.

Can you please have Tana clarify if the counterparty wishes to have a new CP 
name set up as Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company (which 
it sounds like) or if they will make financial trades under Northern Illinois 
Gas Company (since Nicor Gas Company is the physical trading entity).  We 
still cannot report (or even SET UP) the contract until we know which CP name 
is correct.  Until then, the 08/14/00 EOL report will still be outstanding.

Thanks,
Stacey

   

With respect to the attached list, a few things:

1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are

2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA 
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set

I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from

Per Leslie Hansen, the name above is the way the Town of Braintree, 
Massachusetts is setting up their power contract, so this is the way we 
should open them up for EOL.

I have already responded in my initial email.  For whatever reason, the 
counterparty trades physical gas as "Nicor Gas Company".  They trade 
financial as indicated below.    It is now up to EOL to get back with the 
counterparty and get them to amend the Password Applcation.

We have received the First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated  as of 
July 1, 2000 ("Amendment").  This Amendment (1) amends Counterparty's 
Threshold under the Credit Suport Annex, (2) exempts certain Transactions 
when determining "Exposure" under the ISDA Master Agreement, and (3) changes 
the Fixed Price with respect to the "Exempt Transactions" reflected in the 
Amendment.

Copies will be distributed.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

Edmund,

I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea.

under Nicor Gas Company and financial through the dba.  Do you agree?
	Adnan Patel@ENRON
	08/17/2000 04:20 PM
		
Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name "Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names "contractually" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only

Not terminal - at least I hope not!  I have a hiatus hernia which has been 
giving me a lot of difficulties recently. I've been to hospital for a variety 
of test; some not so yucky, so a it yucky (tubes down the nose and into the 
stomach!). I'm seeing my specialist tomorrow to get all the results and 
determine a suitable course of action - I'm getting a bit fed up swallowing 
pills that aren't really doing that much anyway.  I'll keep you updated - but 
don't worry I'll be back on full form in the hopefully not too distant 
future. Edmund

Edmund,

I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea.  
What's the scoop?  Should I be worried?

It is not clear to me what Braintree's should remain open.  Will we shut down 
this Town of Braintree and only keep open Braintree Electric Light 
Department?

Is this OK with you for yur financial agreement?

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,
Stacey

Adnan Patel@ENRON on 08/17/2000 04:20:24 PM
Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name "Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names "contractually" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

In addition to granting full edit access to David Minns in our Australia 
office, he has also required that Alison Keogh and Rob McGrory in his office 
be granted access.  Can you let them know when they have full edit 
capability.  Thanks

I think if once you get full access  you could have your assistant plug in 
the required data for on each ISDA Master in place or draft you have out to 
counterparties.  When you come here I would like to spend just a little time 
going over some of the data and the reporting funtions.  I am going to open 
an Enron counterparty called short name "Enron Australia" and that should be 
the code name you should use.  Please do not change the entries on any of the 
Houston or London based counterparties.

   I fully endorse Mark's suggestion to load up our ISDAs. A worldwide data 
dase of this nature is a valuable resource.  I have access to the data base 
and refer it. Getting our contracts on is on my to do list. What is the best 
way forward.   Yes I will be over in October, I fact I will staying a month. 
However, if there is anything we can do to get info loaded up sooner? We are 
most willing to put in the resources.

When access is being granted could it also be given to my Admin assistant 
Alison Keogh and also Rob McGrory who is also working under my direction on 
ISDA documentation.

Thanks for taking the initative on this matter. 

 

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  

I'll have to go get one this weekend.

All my students are doing so well!  I'm just so proud (sniff, sniff..)!

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering

(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company 
after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name 
certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under 
the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed 
their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas 
Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern 
Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy 
Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their 
master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed 
name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after 
this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".  Upon

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the

product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind 
it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date.  
If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is 
changing an earlier approval.  Further, I put Leslie's notes about any 
particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online 
GTC", or whatever.  Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope 
with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing.

In connection with the confirm I sent you earlier, I am also attaching a form 
of fax letter for transmittal of the confirm to the Counterparty.

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under a 
financial confirmation.  We will need the standard executed copy.  The 
confirmation requires that we deliver the Guaranty within 5 days.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Louis,

The brother of the kids downstairs is renovating a house in the Heights and 
needs an electrician to rewire or do a new fuse box or something.  Do you 
think that your electrician would want to give them a bid on the job, or do 
you have someone else to recommend?  They hired someone, who has in effect, 
taken their money and run, and their house sits, unable to proceed on the 
rest of the renovation work, until they can get the electric work done.

Thanks.

Attached please find Deemed ISDA Confirmation and Form of Transmittal Fax to 
Counterparty.

What's the scoop on your surgery?

I've got a few new products showing up on my list, originating from your neck 
of the woods.  Specifically, we've got MG metals out of Rotterday and Japan.  
Are there any legal issues for my Houston based customer list, or are they OK 
for everybody?

There is no list for 8/21/00, since the only counterparty was a decline.  
I've got two metals products shut down on the above lists until I hear back 
from London.

I just got a phone call from Mike Garred, a commodity trader for New Power 
Company.  He said they were some Enron 50/50 JV.  Whatever he needs to trade 
with us, LC or whatever, he's rearing to go ASAP.  He is wondering where his 
application is in the online process.  He is very eager to trade power & 
gas.  His phone no. is 853-3399.  He said his email says he's not in, but 
leave him a message he's checking them regularly.  His Credit person is Steve 
Nolan, located in Connecticut at 203/531-0400.

Per our discussion, I am attaching a sample form of ISDA Schedule and

haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation

First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at 
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you 
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is 
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type 
stuff.

Second;  Mark

Most Fridays I will need to pick up William from after care at school, 
requiring about a 5:30 departure for me.  Scott plans to oridnarily pick up 
every other day of the week.  If I have a big project etc. I will come back 
in with William.  However, I realize you generally want people available 
until 6 each day.  Hopefully, this will not cause too much trouble.  Mary

Even though it is pretty frequent that this does happen (1 out of 25 masters)

Oh guru of all things Canadian...

I'm working on comments to an ISDA that Hydro-Quebec sent us for an 
affiliate, HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., which is a Delaware corporation.  
Is there anything special about Hydro-Quebec being the Guarantor, or just the 
usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor?

By the way, I hope you're coming up for the Legal Conference.  There are many 
problems at Enron that need our help in getting sorted out, those kinds of 
problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out!  I'm counting on you!

You are a star!  When are you going to get back to Houston?  There's problems 
going on right and left at Enron I think we need to solve!

I'll go for that picking up the cigarettes off the floor thing, it seemed 
somewhat unsanitary anyway.  But if you get so wimpy that you can't survive a 
drink or two with your buddy down south of the border (female at 
that!)...well, we need to toughen you up man!  Repeat after me:  "PARTY, 
PARTY, PARTY!!!"

I am coming to the conference but I am wary of your influences. No drinking, 
and therefore no picking up cigarettes off the floor and smoking them, can be 
permitted.

I have not dealt directly with HQ my self in the past and I know we have 
entered into transactions with them ( I am not sure if we have done anyt 
derivatives) but I would be careful of HQ.  Not only is a HQ a governmental 
entity, I believe it is governed by Quebec civil law, with which us common 
lawers are not overly familiar.  Quebec counsel might be necessary.

Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  its interest in certain financial transactions 
it had entered into with ENA; and

ENA and Morgan Stanley agreed that the Transactions assigned in the above

Hello, for future notices Jeff Sorenson is not in my group and does not work 
with us.  They don't pass documents on to our group.  If their is a way that 
you all can tell if a particular document is related to power and can send me 
a copy if it is related to power that would be great.  There was an agreement 
with Puget Sound (an intermediate agreement until we get an ISDA signed) that 
was given to Jeff Sorenson's group and I never knew it existed.  Therefore I 
sent a confirm out incorrectly.  
Could you possibly ask one of the runners to bring me a copy of this 
assignment?  My location is 3116a.  I would appreciate it.

Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions?

I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting 
as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online.  What I am being told is that 
the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online 
trading.  It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships.  
The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency

Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and 
she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so 
they can start trading when she's out.  She seems to feel the way the ETA is 
written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, 
including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use 
caused by their fault or negligence.  Can you call her at 215/684-6630.  
Thanks.

Who should we contact in order to obtain copies of the approved online GTC's 
for ClickPaper?

Per the emails below, it appears you are looking for the Legal and Privacy 
Statement.  Mark T. said Leslie just revised it for the online team.  Leslie 
is on vacation until the 9th, but I think attached below may be the latest 
draft.  It is located in her "Online" subdirectory, under "Phase 2".

Thanks, but we already have the electronic copies of ETA/PA referenced. What 
we currently need is a word version of the Legal and Privacy Statement. Could 
you send?

Dale,

Alan Aronowitz gave me your name as someone to get in touch with who might 
have an electronic copy of the EOL registration documents.  As I explained in 
my voice mail today, CommodityLogic, an Enron company, is setting up a web 
site that will require users to register to use the site.  We were hoping to 
leverage the work that EOL has already done in this area.

If you have the legal documents and/or registration documents could you 
please forward them to me as soon as possible.  We want to add these things 
to our web site (after we change the text to fit our needs) which is going 
live Friday - so as far in advance as you can get them to us the better.  If 
you do not have the documents could you please let me know or forward this 
note (cc'ing me) to the person you think may have them.

Thanks for your help.

Todd

Please note the following changes:
Ameren Services Company (ASC)
Assigned its sales agreement to:
Ameren Energy, Inc. as agent (ASC)
(for and on behalf of Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren UE, Ameren Energy 
Marketing Company, and Ameren Energy Generating Company)
Transmission remains with Ameren Services Company

With respect to the referenced List:
1.  Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's 
direction
2.  Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade 
power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.  If 
they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to 
contact them & get evidence of their FERC license.
3.  Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate 
more this agency thing.  It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we 
just need more info.

Alan Aronowitz is working on a presentation he has to give in Singapore on 
Global Energy Derivatives, and wanted to put a little blurb in of some kind 
about weather.  He wanted to see if he could get a copy of the presentation 
you and Mike Corbally gave at the ISDA seminar to see if there were any 
slides that might be helpful for his presentation.  Do you have a copy I can 
provide him?  Thanks!

I must have missed your promotion.  Congratulations!  Atttached is the

left Genia a message to see if she could check Leslie's file, but if she's 
not in the office, Leslie may not mind if you look through her Ameren file.

I originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power.  Are we sure 
it is not a FERC approved marketer?

On the attached list, Alliant Energy Corporation is coming back thru to be 
opened for East power, and the power lawyers are telling me they don't have a 
FERC license.  If they really want to trade power I will need a name and 
phone number so our power lawyers can talk to them.

Then, I'll stick with what I told the EOL team.  If they really want to trade 
power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why 
they think they can trade power.  Otherwise, it stays as a "no".

Just a head's up.  Dave finally got the amendment to the ETA signed, so I am 
fedexing it out to the counterparty today.

Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph:  
734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056):
POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
to change the master user.   

When you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the 
file.  Thanks.

I keep trying to email them, but it won't go thru.  Maybe this time...

Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under 
an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Mark and I made some changes to conform the confidentiality provisions in the 
ISDA and Industrial Master Agreements that he wants me to run by you, (1) 
adding financial institutions to ISDA (or deleting from Industrial), and (2) 
adding same language to ISDA that we added to Industrial "...and each of such 
persons" auditors, attorneys, etc.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 4, 2000 amending 
the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies 
will be distributed.

Shari,

I've got them shut down for power.  They were one of the counterparty's on 
the initial approval lists.  The online team tells me we are trading power 
with them off line, so what's the scoop?  Can they trade power?

	Shari Stack
	09/01/2000 02:45 PM
		 
	

I would like to clear up a confusing situation with Ameren which is currently 
taking place: 

On 8/29, Ameren Service Company ("ASC") they asked us to take them off EOL, 
apparently because they now want to trade in EOL under the name "Ameren 
Energy Inc. as agent". 

On 8/29, Legal said OK to taking ASC off EOL and said further that AEI's 
approval to trade on EOL was "on-hold" until Legal checked out the agency 
aspect. Despite this - AEI appears to have been trading on EOL since 8/16 and 
the confirmations we have been receiving back have been marked up by them. 
They are trying to change the name on the confirmations to AEI acting as 
agent for various entities.  I instructed Stephanie Sever yesterday to make 
sure that AEI either acting for itself OR acting as agent does not have 
access to EOL. This needs to stay the case until Legal directs otherwise. 

Just so everyone is aware, Leslie Hansen spoke with Ameren several weeks ago 
and told them that they would need to sign a special Consent Form as well as 
a modified ETA before AEI could act as an agent on EOL. The forms were 
emailed to them on 8/22 and to my knowledge, they have not been returned to 
us.  I have left messages for the Ameren's attorney to call me but she has 
not done so yet.  In any case, until they return the requested documents, 
they cannot trade on EOL. 

With regard to Ameren Service Company, today they appear to want to be back 
on EOL. That is fine so long as it is clear that they are doing so under the 
documentation that they signed originally. 

If anyone has questions, please call me on ext. 39477

Thank you,

Shari

principals can trade.

John,

Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.  Re:  sample master 
agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to 
send out sample masters.  What appears to be happening is that a customer 
gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real 
master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being 
incredibly longer once credit is added.

If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?  Let 
me know your thinking...

Thanks for keeping in touch.  We purchased an indexed product.
Tell me more about your financial offering.  I am interested.

I just got another call from Sandy Steffen, and she would like, if possible, 
to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups, so 
they can be set up to trade by tomorrow.   She also expressed an interest 
espectially today  in NATURAL GAS.   After talking to her can you let me know 
under what contract and/or limitations they can trade.  Thanks

It appears she has only heard back from the online team

Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph:  
734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056):
POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
to change the master user.

Jason Peters off your distribution.

how many sets you need, if any.

Taffy

We have received a copy of an executed Assignment and Novation of 
Transactions dated July, 20, 1999, as amended August 3, 1999, effective on 
August 12, 1999, wherein Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. assigned  
certain transactions to J. Aron and Company.  A copy of the assignment will 
be distributed.

Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.

Do either of you know if this is a wholly owned Enron entity.  we currently

Per Credit, Charlie Hoang on the Confirm Desk needs an Enron Corp. guaranty 
of the attached physical pulp & paper deal.  I told Credit that your group

Tana, per my discussion with Paul Radous, I am
supposed to provide you with some information.
Counterparty has requested a Letter of Guarantee
from the parent company of ENA for pulp purchase.
Enclosed is the contract for this deal.  If you have 
questions, please cal me.  Thank you.

Can you please send a copy of the executed master and any amendments thereto 
to David Dupre on the Confirm Desk.  Thanks!

(watch out, there are 2 David Dupres!)

Yes, to North America, Australia and Japan.

	Karen Lambert
	09/07/2000 04:30 PM
		
Does this apply only to the North American contracts and weather trades for 
which you are responsible?  
Does the instruction below apply to Australia and Japan ISDA's?

Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.

With respect to the referenced list, my instructions from power was to shut 
down Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Lower Colorado River Authority 
from both execute and view status for power.  With respect to Lower Colorado 
River Authority and bandwidth, I spoke to the Broadband team, and they 
haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth, so they 
are running it by outside counsel (who happens to be in Singapore this week), 
and will get back to me.  So until I hear otherwise, I am shutting them down 
for bandwidth.

John and Tana,

The attached is fine from a tax perspective.

Best regards,
Susan

Tana-

I see that ENA is a contemplated counterparty for Japanese weather 
derivatives.  There are both legal and tax issues that require 
consideration.  

I am unsure if Susan Musch has had the opportunity to review the tax issues, 
therefore I have copied her on this note.

With regard to Japanese legal issues, there are certain matters that must be 
dealt with in the GTCs, if entering into transactions between ENA and 
Japanese counterparties are being considered, including issues of an 
underlying legitimate business purpose to avoid gambling restrictions etc.

Please inform me with whom I should be in contact to ensure that these issues 
are appropriately handled.

Thanks,

John

I am not in power any longer, but I would like to comment.  The creation of

new contract when the existing contracts (PV and COB) should be shut down?

We have received an executed Master Agreement:

Effective Date:   May 31, 2000

Counterparty:   The Tudor BVI Global Portfolio LTD.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of:  Pulp 
and Paper

Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...!

We were in the process of revising our form, so I just have to draft up an 
Canadian version of the sample ISDA master and get yoou a draft.  I'll try 
and get to it the next day or two.

Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you 
providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below, 
but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the 
counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.  
As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit 
support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need 
the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together 
these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto?

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Cheers

Greg

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working 
covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master 
competition.   I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the 
outcome of this race.  Could such slanderous allegations be true?

Upon further reflection of the undue influence you have attempted in the past 
and are currently attempting (need we forget you trying to get Bob Crane not 
to sign my agreements!), it seems like you have a lack of confidence in your 
abilities and are therefore unable to run a clean race!

Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" 
information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the 
Interest Rate and Currency Desk.  If possible, we would also like them to see 
the comments screen.  The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, 
George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.

As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.  Can you keep me posted on 
their access.  Thanks!

I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on 
Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based 
weather confirmations.  As soon as I have that information available, I will 
plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.

Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of 
approved jurisdictions for derivatives.  Is it ready yet?  Can I get a copy 
of it?  I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.

Thanks!

Stephanie,

Recently, Enron has introduced a new product, US Power Financial Swaps in New 
York.  I noticed customers are not transacting often on those products and I 
believe it is due to financials not being open to trade with a number of 
companies.  Below I have listed  key customers that need to have this option 
to trade.

American Electric Power Service Corporation
Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc
Florida Power & Light Company
HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc.
New York State Electric & Gas Corporation
Select Energy, Inc.
Ontario Power Generation Inc.
Sithe Power Marketing Inc.
Allegheny Energy, Inc.

Please open these companies if they can trade financials online.  Keep me 
posted on the status.

Thank you very much for your time.

T. Mandola

Per request from the East power group - please review the following 
counterparties for transaction capabilities for East Power Financial Products

Coral Power LLC
Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation
PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P.
Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.
Commonwealth Edison Company
Constellation Power Source Inc.
Entergy Power Marketing Corp.
Amoco Energy Trading Corp

Please let me know if these counterparties can have access to transact on 
financial power products.

Thanks for your help.

Joe,

I got a call from the Coral people that a corrected confirm had already been 
sent to them PRIOR to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of 
the trade.  I'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know I 
was working on this, but I told the Coral people I still needed the 
assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight.  Even tho I hate to 
have to do the additional work, with these EOL trades, there is no "oops" 
trade.  Once we enter into the trade with 1 entity of a counterparty, we 
cannot just "move" the trade.  We need the consent of the assignor and 
assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was 
not legally moved.   If eveyone on your team is not aware of this, can you 
mention it at your next group meeting...thanks!

I'm working on my backlog of lists.  I thought I'd send thru a few so you 
could get started.

HS Energy Services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the ESP 
criteria.  It does not meet the financial test on its own.  However, we have 
approved them to trade financial and have an ISDA Master in place.  Should I 
shut them down for the Australia products?

On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial 
power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.  They are 
part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and 
obviously, a governmental, before the split up.  They are still a wholly 
owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to 
outside counsel about the governmental issues.  I have a call into Canadian 
counsel right now.

Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when 
they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto...

In don't know anything about this, do you?

On 5/11 we traded a Financial Power deal with PG&E Energy Trading - Power 
L.P., EW9838.  We had previously been notified by Credit/Legal that no 
Financial Power deals were to be done with this C/P.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Attached is the proposed draft of the ISDA.  I think two substantive issues 
we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting "Affiliates" 
from the setoff section (which we agreed to in the original).  With all the 
bankruptcies going on right now Carol feels that we should at least make a 
stab at keeping Affiliates in.

Let me know if the draft is OK to send out.

I know you prepared the Grupo Calidra Deemed ISDA, so thought you should see 
Joe's message.

I am not familar with the particulars of the deal, but in the event they 
and/or Enron were to furnish a parent guaranty, then you may need to find if 
Joe received their Guaranty.

Andy, Rob Garfield has asked me to pass along the attached NDA for your legal
folks to review.

Currently, I am working with Chris Behney of Enron in your Market Data Service
department on a NDA as well and is with the Enron legal folks at the moment.
The Reuters legal department has revised the NDA below which is in process 
with
respect to certain initiatives between Reuters and Enron in order for it to
cover the potential energy transactions venture Reuters and Enron are 
currently
discussing.  This document is blackline marked to show changes from the 8/15
version circulated by Natasha Wyss of the Reuters Legal Department.

I do not have access to the Enron legal person to forward this document.  If 
you
could obtain the name from Chris Behney and forward to him/her, we'd 
appreciate
it.

Thanks!

Everyone,

The current value of existing fmtm is ($3.2MM).  Fred and this customer have 
had a falling out and the customer has decided to unwind his position and 
take his business elsewhere.  Because of this, an opposite trade was entered 
into that exactly reciprocated like terms.  This trade has not yet been 
confirmed and is currently pending credit.  As a cost of agreeing to do this, 
the customer was to provide $5.25/bbl on the remaining 92,000 barrels.  This 
amount totals $483,000 which, in the normal course of doing business, is owed 
and due as of tommorrow, September 13.  Fred and his customer, while I was 
listening on a taped line, agreed to structure settlement of trade NY9319 as 
such:

Amounts to be paid;

$483,000 Premium Payment Owed and Due
$192,375 Amount ENA owes this customer for Sept financial settlement - being 
withheld and netted against the $483M
$290,625 net amount to be financed until final payment is made on September 
30.
$1,353  amount of interest on the principal, using interest rate of 10%, 17 
days of tenor
$291,978 exact amount to be paid on September 30

Please structure the above referenced terms into appropriate language for the 
confirmation of trade NY9319 and provide such language to the confirmation 
desk.

Original deal done March 3, 2000:  NB4261

ENA Long Call 28.30  1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00
ENA Short Put 22.50  1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00
ENA Long Put 18.50  1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00

New deal done September 11, 2000:  NY9319

Customer Long Call 28.30   1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00
Customer Short Put 22.50  1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00
Customer Long Put 18.50  1,000/bbls/d Oct-Dec'00

Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to 
finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that 
we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of 
next week.

1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap 
structure including the credit and covenant package.

2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have 
one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global 
Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its 
external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, 
documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or 
exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among 
each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless 
and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and 
financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations 
are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For 
example:

 (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee 
they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to 
accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking 
for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and 
warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon 
this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may 
have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by 
voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a 
long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact 
been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.

 (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I 
now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.

 (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of 
enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect 
to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron 
Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect 
to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.

 (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to 
me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to 
Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal 
opinions.

 (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of 
the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I 
suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.

 (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the 
Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of 
Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.

 (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this 
afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This 
presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps 
involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At 
the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be 
capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation 
through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.

 (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on 
the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent 
upon a final understanding of the swap structure.

 (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not 
clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap 
structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the 
principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate 
"fee letter" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not 
clear as to how "increased costs" would be accounted for in the swap 
structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions 
that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a 
change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those 
increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be 
accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to 
fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes 
or through a separate indemnification in the "fee letter".

 (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the 
paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For 
example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements 
and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in 
Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have 
already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.

Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.

Regards,
Peter

Per our conversation, attached is the form of confirmation we use when we 
adopt by reference the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement into a form of 
confirmation.

Fred wanted to get this draft out today, so I had to get it back from Mary 
and get Robert Bruce to review it, then sent it out.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing a redlined draft of the 
guaranty.   Please let me (713/853-3399) or Sara (713/853-5620) know if this 
change meets with your approval.  Further, I am in the process of drafting 
the Enron Corp. Guaranty with respect to ECT Investments, Inc. and hope to 
have it to you shortly. 

 

Attached is termination revised with Mary's changes.  Per Mary's conv. 
w/Fred, if the Counterparty failed to make payments hereunder, the contract 
would not be void ab initio, but instead, any payments to the counterparty 
would be offset against any amounts owing to us.

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

Tana,

I met with Mark Taylor two weeks ago to discuss legal's business requirements 
for the next generation Global Counterparty System.  He told me that you 
would be a better resource than he for counterparty issues.

Do you have time to meet with me this week for 30 minutes?  Attached is a 
list of questions I have about your needs in relation to the GCP system.

Please let me know what time you will be available and I'll setup a meeting.

The revised form of ISDA exhibit.doc (which contains the credit support annex 
and letter of credit forms) has been moved into the attorney forms bank under 
atty.fms/current forms/isdaexh.doc.  The old form of ISDAexh.doc is now under 
"old forms" in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldISDAexh.doc.  
Again, per my last email, the revised Multicurrency Schedule is already in 
attorney forms.  You may want to circulate blacklined drafts.  The Index to 
the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your 
reference for the most current forms.  It is called "formlist.doc."

London and Singapore, FYI, in addition to making changes to the ISDA 
collateral annex, we made changes to the MAC definitions (which we inserted 
into ISDAexh.doc for ease of the paralegals) and made changes to the letter 
of credit terms, as well as the form of Letter of Credit.   We also added in 
an alternative "Credit Support Amount" provision on the front page of the 
ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to 
return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement.

We moved the guaranty forms (Enron Corp. and Counterparty) as a separate 
document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc.  
The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters 
so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed 
the procedures for timing of demands made on Enron (deleting the 15 day 
period).  We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the Enron 
Corp. guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.

We are close to finalizing changes to the Industrial Master, as well as 
making changes to the Omnibus form of confirmation.
Also, by the end of the day I will have moved our standard forms of 
Secretary's Certificates into the attorney forms bank.

Does any of the below work for you?

There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access 
the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron:

1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and 
are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server
2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our 
network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or 
Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID).

Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and 
limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work.  In 
any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through 
Information Risk Management/Notes Administration.    I'm sure this is not 
very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

This request has been completed.

Also, I spoke with a contact in IRM and they said that the best way for Jason 
to keep is access would be to maintain his NT and Notes accounts and have him 
set up his Laptop/Desktop with a Terminal Server client.  With this Terminal 
Server client he can access the Enron network as if he's in the office (a 
little/lot slower).  

To get Terminal Server:  from his Enron Corp desktop he should click 
"Start-Programs-Utilities-Make Terminal Server Client Disks"  -  Then of 
course he needs to install TS on his machine at A&K (or home).

Let me know if you/he has any questions.

Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" 
information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the 
Interest Rate and Currency Desk.  If possible, we would also like them to see 
the comments screen.  The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, 
George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.

As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.  Can you keep me posted on 
their access.  Thanks!

I need the following 3 files 1st thing:

Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.
Ontario Power Generation
Royal Bank of Canada/Enron Canada Corp.

Thanks!

Online would like to open this counterparty immediately for trading.  Can you 
let me know ASAP whether you have any legal issues with them.  Thanks.

Per our conv. earlier, attached is our standard form of Enron Corp. Guaranty.

Peter,

We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to 
include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.

I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any 
final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.  When you get a 
minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your 
approval.

Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised 
one (which is #1 documents below).  Can you print them out for Peter.

Thanks!

  

The above counterparty is approved to trade all products.

Attached are the two ISDA's.

We have been pressured by the online team to open up all counterparties to 
trade financial unless we have a LEGAL reason not to trade with them.  With 
both those counterparties, you are correct, it is the companies' intention 
and direction that we trade financial with those entities, but still for 
online I have to say "yes" unless I have a "legal" reason to say "no".

We were reviewing the attached list and had a few questions on the 
Counterparty Names:

Aquilla Energy Marketing Corporation  .....We are trading financial deals 
with them under the name Utilicorp United Inc. 
Coral Power LLC    .....We are using Coral Energy Holding L.P. (this is the 
entity with whom we have the Master Agreement) 

Let me know what you think on these two...

Kim Theriot

Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her 
request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial 
power products online.  Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need 
to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).

All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them 
for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for 
financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they 
cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent 
guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for 
all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather 
per our earlier emails).

I was just about to call you when I got your email.  Holly called and she has 
a table to fill at an awards banquet (some women's professional group or 
something) and wants to know if you want to join us.  A bunch of her 
girlfriends are going, me, Lucinda, I think Carol....anyway, it's Saturday 
night at 7:00 pm.  She said it should be really boring (so I put it on my 
calendar as "boring awards banquet"), but with all the girls at one table 
we'll misbehave and have fun.  I hope you can join us.  Let me know and I'll 
reserve you a spot w/Holly.

The thing on your house and townhome sounds exciting.  When can I see it?!

I'm having a little online brain drain today...am I correct in my thinking 
that all these "spreads" are financial...?

Can you provide Stephanie Sever with the Online team view access to the 
referenced database.  Can you let us know when the access has been granted.  
Thanks!

This list is all amended counterparties, most of them being opened up for 
financial power.  My records reflect that all of them were already open for 
financial products, except the three I have marked.  If you run across any 
others that you show as not being open for financial, let me know, because 
all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial.

Also, on this list, my records reflect that Superior Natural Gas Corporation 
was shut down for physical power.  If you records do not reflect the same, 
can you shut them down...thanks!

I still haven't received that list you mentioned of counterparties in 
bankruptcy or workout.  What's the scoop?

I don't know about you, but I LOVE lists with only one counterparty to 
approve, how about you?!!

I have a database where I maintain my online approval, and my the basis for 
my approvals/declines.  If you want to review counterparties we have 
previously approved/disapproved and why, or want to go in and to see what I 
approved on a specific counterparty, this would be the place to go.  Would 
you like me to get you access?

Well, I do believe this makes 450!  A nice round number if I do say so myself!

Bermuda has been approved as a jurisdiction for all financial products using 
the ENA format of GTC with New York Law.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

We have received a proposed assignment from PPL Corporation to PPL Energy 
Plus, LLC wherein they would like to assign their financial transactions 
(two), any guaranty relating thereto (do we have one covering financial?), 
and any master agreement (we have no financial agreement with them).  Is this 
OK with Credit?  I am having a copy of the assignment walked down to you.  If 
someone else is going to approve this, let me know.

I left Bill Ernstaft a message.  Hopefully I'll hear back from him after

Janelle:  My Law people tell me we'll want to use the "Multi-Currency, Cross
Border" ISDA with the NYPA version of the Confirmation (that I sent to you).
In addition, they want New York law to govern not Texas law.  Re the
guaranty,  we want to send you our draft on that account for your review and
will do so this PM. Can Enron accommodate all this? Thanks, MIKE.

Hi Mike!
A parent guaranty is no problem.  I'm attaching a copy, so you know what it
looks like.
We have a standard "long form" confirm ourselves, that is used until an
ISDA is signed.  I attached a draft below so you could see it as well.
We typically send these standard confirms to all our customers, so it may
expedite things if NYPA doesn't have any aversion to this confirm.  What
are your typical procedures? Would you accept our confirm, or should I go
head and get our documentation people to get started looking over yours?
Was the annual report on the web site sufficient, or would you like me to
Fed-Ex one? Let me know what else can do.

Hi Mike!
Our legal/documentations department tells me that we started putting
together an ISDA with NYPA over a year ago, but never completed it.  What
we need prior to any deals being executed is a legal opinion that contracts
are enforcable and statutory authority (I suppose this is compliments of
Orange County).  Can I have our documents person call you...or is someone
else there more appropriate

Rick, could you please let me know how I need to set up the execution lines 
on the two ISDA Master agreements for RBC and Bow Valley.  Does the bank 
require two signature lines?  What is the wording you need for Bow Valley's 
execution line (I assume it will be something like "Bow Valley Trust, by its 
duly appointed Trustee, X"?

Can you let me know as soon as possible so that I can have the standard forms 
of the actual ISDA agreement and Credit Support Annex prepared for execution 
tomorrow.  For logistics, can you also let me know whether the people who 
will be executing the documents on behalf of RBC and Bow Valley in Calgary or 
Toronto.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching our current from of ISDA 
Schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for 
such entities.  With respect to NYPA, we do have a copy of an authorization 
to hedge approved by the Board of Trustees of NYPA that they faxed us a year 
ago and I will fax a copy of it over to you shortly.

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/23/00 amending the 
Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will 
be distributed.

FUNB sits stalled on my desk waiting for me to have time to work on it.  We 
are in the miiddle of a rush with Financial Power counterparties in need 
immediate assistance (many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention) 
and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and I'm just putting out 
fires.  That master is really not a priority at all for ENA, and it is only 
Enron.Credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority.  What 
is your proposed timing for a deal on that one?

Tanna,

Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If you
could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in
place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick request and
that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have spoken to
Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you
in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's
negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and
how long before it is likely to be finalised?

Many thanks,

Clare Godson

The one I have is the blue (deep purple) flower.  I think it is a new color.

It has a little light orange fruit on it, hence the name 'Golden Dewdrop'.

It is not really a big deal if you don't want it.  I was just offering it to
you first because it is a neat plant.

Per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at NYPA, they would like to 
transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we 
consider an "ISDA Confirmation" (it seemed to me their lawyer thought this 
document was a sufficient ISDA Master).  Sara has a call into him to get his 
thoughts about this document  Per my conversations w/Sara, we would like to 
get our standard governmental form of ISDA Master in place.  We wonder what 
your thoughts are on his document.  Further, he seemed quite firm that they 
would not be issuing a legal opinion, but would give us a certified copy of 
the resolution I am about to fax to you.   We look forward to getting your 
comments.

I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of 
broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little 
cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we 
have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat 
you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the 
game...GO TEAM!!!

FYI,

I will be preparing this assignment for signature.

Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them 
read access.
2.  Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them 
for financial power

On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of 
Utilicorp.  However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I 
hope by my note only it will do the job.  I am also preparing an assignment 
of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.

  

The execution documents were sent over to Duke Energy yesterday.  I spoke to 
them this morning and they we going to forward the documents internally for 
signature.  I, or Marie upon her return from vacation, will keep you posted 
on the progress of execution.

Hi Tana,

I know that you are expecting to get back to me next Wednesday but our
traders faced credit issues with Enron today and they asked me to push
forward the process of getting all agreements in place as soon as. Thus, I
am sending you a draft of a restated and amended guaranty agreement hoping
that this will help to speed up the process. I will call you on Monday.

Attached are revised commodity swap confirms.  I didn't change the rate swap 
and we're still waiting for input from the bank.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing clean and blacklined drafts 
of each of the Bow River Trust and Royal Bank of Canada ISDA Schedules.

 

 

Leslie Hansen asked me to forward to you our draft list of Legal contacts for 
online trading issues, and see if there is anyone you deal with on a regular 
basis that I may not know of that we need to add to the list.  

I hope you're OK?!   You probably don't remember (especially after getting

Hi tana

We have recently negotiated and signed an Isda with Barclays Bank ,(ECTRIC 
being the Enron Entity) which included some additional clauses in the 
Schedule( regarding Enron online trading) which Barclays want to include in 
the already existing ISDA  between ENA and Barclays. The details and The 
suggested Amendment  Agreement are included below. Please could you take a 
look at this  wording.The clauses are identical to those that we have argeed 
in the latest Isda.

Good to speak to you this afternoon and I will let you know how Edmund is

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?

  

Obviously, you haven't lost your touch!

Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review 
by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the 
provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.  When we get this in 
signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment, 
but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place 
to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention, 
we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this 
will cost us money too!  We don't want to have to do this too often.)  
Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?!

Ask and you shall receive...

Yes, except for weather, the financial GTC's are designed to cover all energy

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 23, 2000 amending 
the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies 
will be distributed to Frank Davis and to Peter Keohane for the Enron Canada 
Talisman file. 

Per our conversation, attached is the proposed form of amendment to the ISDA 
Master to provide for cash collateral under the Credit Support Annex.  Please 
call me at 713/853-3399 or Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Department at 
713/853-3263 if you have any comments or questions.

Per our conversation, the above counterparty is approved by Legal to trade 
online physical pulp & paper only.  We cannot trade financial until Credit 
receives financial statements and can determine whether they are an eligible 
swap participant or not.

Chris,

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

 

The bottom of this email will explain my email to Gaffer.

Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you 
providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below, 
but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the 
counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.  
As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit 
support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need 
the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together 
these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto?

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Cheers

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg

Julian,

The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in 
writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.  I don't know if what 
they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a 
Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have 
done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation 
filled in with the proposed deal terms.  I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a 
voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.  As soon as I 
hear from her I'll get her what she needs.  If you have any more questions, 
email me back, or call.  I'm at your service!

Samantha,
Tana,

I have attached an amended credit worksheet for the referenced counterparty.  
This amended worksheet includes a Guaranty from its parent company of $5MM, 
thus increasing the collateral threshold to $5MM, and amending other credit 
covenants.

Per the Legal Comment in the Master Swap Lotus Notes Database, Tana received 
a call from the counterparty requesting a 'less complicated' agreement.  In 
the comment, Tana suggested using an Industrial Master, if this agreement is 
OK from a Legal standpoint, I am OK using the Industrial from a Credit 
standpoint.  

Please draft this amended credit worksheet to an amended Industrial Master.  

Thank you,

Russell

It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product 
on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what 
restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in 
Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not 
located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.

Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it 
wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was 
that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for 
counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that 
the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was 
restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online 
approvals.

The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal 
team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade 
US bandwidth segments.

P.S. we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list.

Thanks, I appreciate it!  What should I do with the Japanese counterparty on 
the 9/26/00 list?  Shut them down for all trading on Japan based products 
until I hear from you?  Will you be coming to the Legal Conference here in

As a reminder,

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 9/12/00 which amends the 
ETA to provide that Ameren Energy, Inc. can act as authorized agent for and 
on behalf of the following entities ("Operating Companies") under such ETA:

1.  Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE)
2.  Ameren Energy Generating Company
3.  Ameren Energy Marketing Company

The amendment to the ETA makes additional changes with respect to the agency 
relationship between Ameren Energy, Inc. and the Operating Companies.

In connection with such amendment to the ETA we have also received:

1.  The originally executed Password Application 
2.  Consent and Acknowledgement executed by the Operating Companies with 
respect to such agency relationship

Copies will be distributed.

Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to 
Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe 
(www.bishopslodge.com).   Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a 
silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.  
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink 
to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the 
activities going on in Santa Fe.  I think you are going to be too late for 
their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other 
fun things going on.  The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking 
pool, horseback riding and shooting.  Take a look.

As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the 
U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap 
agreements.  I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept. copies of the 
current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him 
revisions to the forms.  I'll keep you posted when the changes occur.

Is anyone working on a confirmation for the Argentina office for a swap

Yes, I would like to have access.  Please ask Mike to email me once he's 
given me access.

Thank you.

FYI,

I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and 
reasons why (if there are any!).  I don't know to what extent Frank ever 
looked at it, but you might find it helpful.  It is called "ENA Legal Online 
Trading Agreements" database.  If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to 
get you access.

Dear All

This is just a quick note to let you know that I will be leaving Enron next 
Friday to return to New Zealand in order to enjoy an extra summer and to 
study a bit more law.

I'll be around until Friday 6th August should you have anything specific you 
would like me to deal with, but Michael Slade will now be dealing with all of 
my files. Michael has joined us from Covington & Burling and can be contacted 
on 0171 970 7433 or at mslade@enron.co.uk.

Thanks to all of you for your assistance and advice over the past few years, 
it has been a pleasure working with you.

Kindest regards,
Sasha

Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their 
Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not 
have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed 
today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the 
agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will 
need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm 
that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.

As per my voicemail, attached are the officer's certificates we will require.

Do you know what address TD Bank will be using on the ISDAs?  (presumably 
their Calgary Main Branch)  also, are there transaction numbers for each of 
the ISDAs yet so that we can fill in the blanks on the certificate and 
opinions (RE ISDA Agreement Master No. ?)

So far as much as I've been able to track, the Houston Confirmation Desk does 
not know about this Duke Confirm yet.  Don, can you contact Dale Neuner on 
the Confirmation Desk ASAP with the proposed deal terms so he can prepare the 
Confirm and get it sent over to Duke.  Thanks!
Tana, do you know what's the "Confirmation Letter" Duke is talking about in 
the e-mail below? They are requesting us to send it to them.

Good!  I hope this is the first of a number of transactions we enter into 
together.   Please have your people sending the ISDA back to our lawyers in 
Houston with Duke's signature so we then complete the loop.

Julian, would you please co-ordinate asap with our Houston staff to have them 
sending the confirmation to Roni at the fax number below?  Thanks.

We are in receipt of the ISDA agreement, partially executed by ECT.

We would like for ECT to send the confirmation letter to Roni Cappadonna in 
Houston, at 713-627-4778.  The fax number is 713-627-6524.

Per,

What's the deal he's talking about?  I also do not think we could put ENA and 
Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.  When you have a mingute give

Mike, have you been able to figure out how to get Brent Hendry, who is now in 
Buenos Aires, access to our Master Swap Agreement database?  Can you let me 
know.  I'm getting bugged about this.

I do not know the answer to your question.  I suggest you talk to Credit.  
Financial does indeed have a master with Weyerhaueser Company Limited.  I 
have no idea what we trade physical under or what other Weyerhaueser  
companies we may have business with.

	Bridgette Anderson@ENRON
	09/29/2000 06:37 PM
		 
Karen et al.,

To begin with, I contacted Legal (Tana Jones) in reference to Weyerhaeuser 
Company listed on the Clickpaper Credit Response 090700, and left her a 
voicemail message since she was not available.  She has not yet responded.

Since then, I have been in contact with Global Counterparty and they have 
advised me that the CP#11319 Weyerhaeuser Company (the CP reported on 
Clickpaper 090700) is the parent to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser Company Limited 
(the CP that we currently have an executed contract ). 

Based on similar issues in the past, and supported by Mary Solomonson's 
agreement with the Legal department, the Global Contracts group will not 
provide a response until Legal clarifies the issue.  Accordingly, we will not 
include the current Global Contract number given to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser 
Company Limited unless and until Legal approves the contract for Weyerhaeuser 
Company.

Regards,
Bridgette

I am just confirming with each of you that I will be opening up The Toa 
Reinsurance Company Limited, a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list to 
trade all physical and financial products, including Australian and Japanese 
weather, which seems to be the products they are truly interested in 
trading.  Let me know if you have any problems with that immediately.

I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.  On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison 
Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I 
already had them open for emissions.  Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I 
am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for 
physical gas.

I confirmed w/Brad that they are still an ESP, so it's OK to open them up for 
all financial.

As you all are probably aware, we trade physical and financial products with 
Northern Illinois Gas Company under each of the following names:

1  Northern Illinois Gas Company (the legal incorporated entity)
2.  Nicor Gas Company (an assumed name for Northern Illinois Gas Company as 
reflected in the Assumed Name Certificate dated 12/15/99 filed with the 
Secretary of State of Illinois.  The name needs to match the Assumed Name 
Certificate, no "Co.")
3.  Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company

The EnronOnline counterparty has been set up as "Nicor Gas Company".

Pursuant to Bob Bruce's conversation with our Illinois outside counsel, we 
are comfortable transacting business in the State of Illinois under the 
assumed name "Nicor Gas Company".  In connection therewith, it is OK to set 
up the online entity as "Nicor Gas Company", and attach the relevant physical 
or financial products to the relevant master under each of the above 
counterparty names.  Further, it will be OK if the confirmations go out as 
"Nicor Gas Company" even though the masters may be under one of the above 
names.

PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, this should be considered an exception to the rule.  We 
do not want counterparties to be set up under assumed names, d/b/a's or 
divisions for EnronOnline.  As previously agreed with the Online team, every 
attempt should be made to incorporate the legal name as part of the 
counterparty name (such as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas 
Company" or "Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Division").   Any exceptions to this should be run by Legal for 
approval.

Did you make a note under H.Q. Energy Services in Lotus Notes...?

At the request of Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, I am attaching a copy of 
our proposed form of Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and proposed form 
of counterparty legal opinion.  If you have any questions, please call Sara 
at (713) 853-5620 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to getting your 
comments.

We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 
("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the 
approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed 
the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and 
paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and 
option transactions"  with ENA.

For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we 
trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps 
and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both 
ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.

I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts 
and Camille Gerard.

referred to below in a similar contract between ECTRIC and Utilicorp. United 
Inc.   Pls send me a electronic copy of the executed contract.  Tks.

Hi!

Thanks for your help.  According to Matt Dawson, it looks like a signed ISDA 
has been executed between ENA and Utilicorp United Inc. in the past.  We will 
also need an ISDA between ECTRIC and Utilicorp United Inc.  You mentioned 
perhaps mirroring the existing ISDA however with the restricted lists I 
believe you will be to obtain the copy easier than we will.  However, if you 
would like Utilicorp to produce a draft, let  me know and I can request that 
from the woman in the e.mail below. 

Please advise and I will pass the information on to Utilicorp.

Thank you

Hi Yumi,

I did confirm with our weather desk that we will be transacting as Utilicorp
United Inc.  Sorry for the confusion!  How do you want to proceed on the
ISDA?

There seems to be some question whether Utilicorp. can trade financial.  I 
opened them to trade all financial (including power) on 7/26/00.  I think the 
customer is calling Kathy for access.  There should be no change in their 
physical power profile.

Attached below is the Argentine customer list for EnronOnline.  My 
understanding is that we will launch EnronOnline in Argentina within the next 
couple of weeks.  With this in mind, I think we will have to shoot for the 
end of next week (October 13) to have customer profiles completed.  Please 
let Lisa Lees know of any conflicts or issues that arise.

Thanks!

Good Morning Tana,

Thank you so much for faxing the ISDA with Utilicorp.  However would you be 
so kind to send the 1st 18 pages again.  They seem to have disappeared in our 
office.  I have everything after that (Schedule to the Master Agreement, 
Credit Support Annex, Paragraph 13 Annex, Exhibit A to Paragraph 13, and 
Exhibit A Guaranty)

I would greatly appreciate if you would fax the first 18 pages of the ISDA 
(footer states "ISDA 1992") to +47 23 10 25 50.

Thank you for your help.

Have a great day and weekend.
Sincerely,

Notice No. 00-347
October 6, 2000

MEMORANDUM

TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

DATE: October 6, 2000

RE:
Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20
Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc
____________________________________________________________________

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive=
=20
Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary=
=20
basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20
order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th=
at=20
are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for=
=20
trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours ("RTH") on the trading=20
floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20
commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000.

By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi=
ng=20
activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility=
=20
that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20
Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega=
rd to=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways:

(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=
=20
futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two=
=20
contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with=
=20
limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the=
=20
applicable rule.

(2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months=
=20
for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that=
=20
futures contract.

(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer=
,=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than=
=20
requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la=
st=20
90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far =
as=20
long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits.

Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20
contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20
fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope=
n=20
with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul=
e,=20
even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc trading session.

If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES=
Sc=20
Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX=

General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE
FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for=
=20
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that=
=20
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below=

with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc:

contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the=
=20
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit=

shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide=
=20
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri=

the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched=

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f=

HI Tana 

Here is the Amendment Agreement containg the additional "online" wording 
agreed for the ECTRIC ISDA  that  Barclays want included in the ENA Isda. I 
hope this is O.K. If you need anything else please call. Will also  enter the 
new ISDA in data base ASAP.

Thanks

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?

  

Attached is the referenced list.  I am saying "amended-no change" because for 
Calpine, I originally had them open for power & financial, and I am not 
changing that approval, and for Nicor, I originally had them open for 
financial and shut down for power and I am not changing that approval.

I'm preparing for a presentation I have to give tomorrow.  Once I'm done with 
this I'll give you a call...

Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy 
West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement 
with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago 
with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not 
showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to 
me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they 
would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.

Brent,

I am having this woman with Duke here in Houston, Roni Cappadonna, calling me 
wanting to get the form of the confirmation.  I don't know what to tell her.  
Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to 
wait until the trade is done?  I think the person that really needs to be 
handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.  I am kinda just in the middle of the 
confirm thing.  Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm 
information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing 
with Roni.

The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm.

Standard ownership change is fine.

It has been brought to my attention that we have done several internal trades 
the last few days with the referenced wholly owned Enron company (right 
Tony?!).  With Tanya's approval, we need to get out an ISDA Master between 
Northern and RMT with no credit except the standard change of ownership 
clauses.   If that is OK with Tanya, Susan, can you pass on this master to 
the next paralegal in the rotation.  Tony will attend to getting the master 
signed from Northern's side.

Thanks.

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.

Please could you let me know if you can prepare such a document and also what

Unfortunately this is becoming quite urgent and any assistance you can give

All,

I will leave the office @ 11:00 am and will return by 1:30pm or earlier.

See you all then.

Susan S. Bailey

That change will have to be approved by Mark Taylor, who is out of town until 
next week.

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the 
directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their 
availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can 
go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of 
today.

exchange C$10MM guarantees between Enron & Epcore.

I keep getting calls from a lady named Kathy at ACES (who is agent for 
Wabash) looking for a draft of the ISDA Agreement.  She gave me another  
contact for Wabash .... Jill Hoerger at (317) 481-2851.

Please remember that all online confidentiality agreement should be logged in 
through me, I prepare a list of them for the Online Team.  All regular 
conffidentiality agreements should be logged in through one of the paralegals 
so we can monitor them.  Also, we need to do a conflicts check with Kay.  
Thanks.

Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau 
sent up for our review.  We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we 
need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading 
websites, and (2) respond to Craig about this agreement.  When you both get 
back in town can we set a time to discuss this.  Thanks...

Mark Taylor is going the be the host of the next ECT Legal Conference to be 
held in the Woodlands in October and he asked me to contact you to see if you 
know yet which of the Brits are going to be attending because we need to 
start making reservations.  If you get a minute and can drop me a line I'd 
appreciate it.  Thanks!

For the online trading project, I am trying to track down for the U.K., the 
Datasource, Reporting Service, and Reporting Agency for the GTC.  I 
understand that you might either have that information or be able to direct 
me to someone who does.  I appreciate whatever help you can give me!

Can y'all help me get the document below signed by an officer of ECC and 
return the originally signed document to me.  I will send them all out 
together back to the counterparty.  FYI-Andy Zipper is second in command to 
Louise Kitchen for EnronOnline.  Thanks for your help!

Per Leslie's earlier email, she wants power trading for Tri-State only under 
one entity, so I have shut down Tri-State Power Marketing (the division), and 
have opened them up under Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, 
Inc., which, per my conv. w/Stephanie, is being amended to add "through its 
Tri-State Power Marketing Division" to the PA.

Per a head's up from Tanya, LG&E Power Marketing was merged into LG&E Energy 
Marketing and is no longer an active corporation.  Take it off the executed 
master list.

I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.

In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online 
team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we 
will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.

I do not believe that statement is correct.  The limitation was required in 
the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all 
agreements.  Can you send me up a copy of the Password Application and I will 
give Steve Norris a call.  Thanks.

	Camille Gerard@ENRON
	10/14/2000 12:44 PM
		
Tana,

We now have an application from Tembec, Inc.   Steven Norris, as Treasurer, 
is the one signing the Password Application for Tembec.   When John Cummings 
met with him last week, Steve stated that he would be involved in setting up 
the users for Physical transactions.

After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule 
applies to Financial transactions only.

In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access 
without two officers' signing?

If so, then we could get them on-line with Physical access and then work on 
whatever we need for Financial access.

Thanks for your help!
Camille
36150

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.

Dear Tana,

Re Japanese counterparties generally, we are preparing a list of documents to 
be submitted at time of application for passwords, as well as a check box for 
use by EOL staff in considering applications to deal with the various general 
legal issues which have been raised.  (The idea is that anything which falls 
out of the boxes comes to me for separate consideration but we trying to do 
it to minimize this need.) 

Re Japanese counterparties which want to do weather, the safest approach for 
a would-be counter party which is not a bank, securities company or insurance 
company (or at least does not have these words in its name) is for the 
application to come back to me in Tokyo for consideration in the context of 
the laws which prohibit gambling and what we can do to protect ourselves.  

Thanks.

Tana, Sam and I are putting together a draft ISDA between ENA and an 
Australian bank -- I understand from Sara that you worked with her on a 
recent ISDA w/ James Hardie, another Australian bank.

It does not appear from the CP has delivered its legal opinion to us -- 
however, do you have a draft of legal opinion that Sam could use as a 
template?  if so, could you e-mail it to Sam?

We have been asked to get a draft out on a rush basis so any help you can 
provide in expediting this would be appreciated -- thanks, Bob

Per our conversation, I am attaching a sample form of online weather GTC.  As 
we discussed, I am trying to complete the information for "Datasource" and 
under "Floating Amount" for Reporting Service and Reporting Agency for the 
U.K.  Thanks for your help!

 

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which 
guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will 
need the standard executed copy.  This guaranty will supersede and replace, 
in part, the prior guaranty with respect to ENA and Counterparty.  The 
guaranty will be fully replaced when counterparty receives the new Enron 
Corp. Guaranty with respect to the obligations of Enron Canada and Engage 
Canada (still covered under the existing guaranty, and such replacement is 
still under negotiation).

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Attached is documentation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State 
reflecting the name change of Engage Energy US, L.P. to Coastal Merchant 
Energy, L.P., such name change to be effective on October 3, 2000 (per the 
corrective amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State attached 
hereto.  Please make a note of this name change in your records.

Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.

Thanks!  I'll get Lavo's title changed.  I spoke to our buddy in London this 
morning.  He seems to be doing wonderful, as usual.  He and Sue are getting 
ready to buy a new house in Twickenham, four bedrooms, garage (so he can park 
his new convertible home instead of across town) on the river.  It sounds 
really nice.  He has been traveling alot.  Weddings almost every weekend for 
months.  Rowing.  That about sums it up.

I ran into Gaffer for the 1st time in months.  By his traveling schedule, I 
think we've really hired him to be a door to door salesman.

I heard the Mounties have arrived for you.  Your new lawyer has started.  
Congrats!

I checked w/the Corp. Secretary's office, and they were unaware that Rex and 
Dave  were appointed as MD's, so the corporate paralegal is getting the board

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the 
directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their 
availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can

Hi Tana

Thanks for quick response.

I'm happy for the unanimous consents of the directors and the 
attorneys-in-fact.  Please could you let me know when these have been signed 
and are effective.

Thanks for your help.

First, this counterparty is OK to trade physical power.  I just spoke to 
Leslie, and she said it was OK to set up "Ameren Energy, Inc. as  Agent " 
under one cpy id # for the three utilities and that's how they would trade.  
We spoke to Melissa Murphy on the Power Confirm Desk and she is going to set 
up a special confirmation template that will add the three utilities names to 
the confirmations before they go out.  I think this is how Global 
Counterparty already set them up.  If this doesn't compute, let me know...

The Confirmations would then go out as Ameren Energy, Inc., as Authorized 
Agent for and on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing Company, Ameren Energy 
Gathering Company, and Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE).

Are you holding up this cpy for any reason?

Are you working on an ETA amendment for them?

We have received the executed Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement 
with the referenced Counterparty dated 10/18/00.  I will deliver a copy to 
Dovie Keprta, until I receive any further direction as to who you would like 
to be the central file keeper for eMarket Services documents.

Very good!

Thanks for the note.  Just pass on my concern for Clarissa and hope for her 
improvement.

Hi Tana

Michael has asked me to get in touch with you to apologise for not contacting 
you earlier and to say that unfortunately Clarissa is very ill and in and out 
of hospital so he will not be able to contact for the next couple of weeks.  
Consequently, he will not be in the office the  rest of the week and will 
also not be in next week.  He is not picking up his emails but is picking up 
voicemails.  If you would like me to pass any message on to him, please just 
email me or call me on 0207 783 7212.

Thanks
Fiona

I'm OK all day long, so just email me when you want to chat (our time) and 
I'll make sure I'm at my desk.

Attached below is the Argentine customer list for EnronOnline.  My 
understanding is that we will launch EnronOnline in Argentina within the next 
couple of weeks.  With this in mind, I think we will have to shoot for the 
end of next week (October 13) to have customer profiles completed.  Please 
let Lisa Lees know of any conflicts or issues that arise.

Thanks!

Just a note to remind you to add the "ESP' and "Country" information to 
clickpaper spreadsheets too so I can get those out while you're gone.

At the request of David Minns their short name in Lotus Notes will be EAF 
(for Enron Australia Finance).   David gave me a list of their masters, so I 
am going to enter just the names and agreement.  David and Alison will flesh 
out the rest of the data when he gets back.

Leslie Hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her 
to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.  I told her we were 
meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had 
no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have 
control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can 
control and prevent "rogue" trading.  She said before she sent this out she 
would contact you.

The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered them 
into the database.  We still don't have copies.  Further, I don't know more 
than if it's executed and the date.   They need to flesh out the additional 
information that is required.

ANP Marketing Company has faxed in their PA and ETA amendment and we should 
get the originals in by fedex today.  They are hot to trade ERCOT online, and 
I don't know if they can trade it or not, but if we could move them up to the 
top of the credit review list they would be most happy.

The critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued.  
Thanks for your help.

Mark Taylor asked me to run something on Online Trading by you.  We got a 
list of questions on various Online Trading issues from the Products Control 
Group which appears to be the group the will be managing the Online Trading 
HelpDesk.  One of their questions related to the desire of HelpDesk managers 
to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what 
they explained as a "quality control" over the responses given to customers 
on the HelpDesk.  They explained it as being like when your credit card 
company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to 
time.

Is this something we want to do?  If we do, that brings up other issues, and 
we will have to run this by our outside counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell.

Can you let me know your thoughts...Thanks!

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS
ALL MEMBER FIRMS

FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice-President

SUBJECT: PROPOSED RULE TO ALLOW STRIP TRADING IN PROPANE
The NYMEX Board of Directors has voted to allow strip trading in the Propane 
Contract.  The proposed amendment to Rule 6.08D must be reviewed by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prior to implementation.  The 
proposed rule amendment is attached below.

This rule amendment will become effective after CFTC approval is received.  
The Membership will be notified when strip trading will begin.

If you have any questions, please contact Daniel Brusstar at (212) 299-2604.

PROPOSED RULE AMENDMENT
(*Asteriks* surrounding a word or phrase represent an addition, and 
[brackets] a deletion)

NYMEX Floor Rules
Rule 6.08D.   STRIP TRANSACTIONS

(A) Definition:  A strip transaction shall consist of either the simultaneous 
purchase or sale of an equal number of contracts in each of two or more 
consecutive contract months for crude oil futures, natural gas futures, 
heating oil futures, gasoline futures, *propane futures,* or electricity 
futures for a single account that is quoted and traded at a single price.

(B) Floor Members executing strip transactions shall properly record them in 
writing so as to permit the identification of the strip transactions and the 
parties thereto.  All strip transactions for futures contracts for crude oil, 
natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity on the Exchange 
trading floor must be made by open outcry in the trading rings for crude oil, 
natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity, as 
applicable.  All strip transactions must be in line with prevailing contract 
prices for strip transactions and the prices of futures contracts for crude 
oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline,  *propane,* or electricity, as 
applicable, comprising the strip transaction shall be within the permissible 
price limits of the contract months traded.

(C) The seller in each strip transaction must report on the hard copy ply of 
his or her trading card the price of the strip transaction to the Exchange.  
The Exchange shall then assign the prices for each of the crude oil, natural 
gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity futures contracts 
months comprising the strip transaction pursuant to a methodology as 
established by the Exchange.

(D) Except as provided in Rule 6.08C(C), strip transactions shall not set off 
stops in any contract.

I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and 
QuickQuote.com in order to 
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron 
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent 
questions that may need your
legal opinion.

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

Ron Nolte
10/16/2000 12:37 PM
Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com logo?

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself?

The attached GTC should not be used in relation to any financial product.  It

Should the following document be attached to all lumber deals?  Recently, 
there was a clickpaper deal for lumber; the online GTC was attached to the 
confirmation.  But, a question on this document has since been raised.

Please advise.

Thanks,

We also received the originally executed Password Application and Customer

in Legal.

Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the 
list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at 
the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.  

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  You 
should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access 
only.  They should not see our comments.  That information is confidential 
and subject to attorney/client privilege).   Let me know if you do not have 
edit access.  Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside 
your area of responsibility.  A few notes...

There is some great reporting functionality in this database.  Check out some 
of the sorts on the left.  There is a drop down called "Pending Swap 
Update".  That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial 
agreements.  There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate 
reports for you compan

The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are 
critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.  Kinda, before you do/authorize 
a trade read this.  Not for general legal notes.  

Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded 
elsewise (it will mess up reporting).  If you are amending an agreement or 
superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".

 I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs.  
If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.  

Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

I was just sitting here thinking, now that y'all are doing the financial 
confirms up there, your Confirmation Desk people need to be on the 
distribution list for our emails when we get signed masters in, so they know 
when they need to change from a non-master style of confirm, to a master 
style of confirm.  Who, pray tell, might your Confirmation Desk people be so 
we can add them...

We have received an executed Assignment and Novation Agreement dated 8/16/00 
where EOL commodity swap Deal No. 267025, transacted 6/23/00 originally 
between Amoco Canada ("Amoco Canada") Petroleum Company and Enron Canada 
Corp.   The trade has been assigned as follows:

Amoco Canada assigned its interest in the trade to BP Amoco Corporation

ECC assigned its interest in the trade to ENA.

Copies will be distributed.

Tana,

Can you provide me with the Bank name, ABA # and acct # for ENA where a 
counterparty should wire funds per an ISDA.  We have a counterparty that 
wants this info in case a confirm doesn't specifically provide it.

Thanks,

Jason

There are a number of Argentina counterparties on this list that I will need 
your sign off on.  Brent said he things they will probably be OK to trade 
Argentina Gas, but to run it by you.  Can you let me know if you have any 
issues.

I am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too.  
Initially, we should have a rush of Argentina counterparties, but after 
awhile, it should dwindle.  The rule is, you have ONE DAY to respond  or I 
will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list.

In response to our comments from yesterday's form meeting, I am saving the 
Industrial in my forms directory, now as #5 draft.  If you have to draft one 
let me know, and we'll figure out which form to work off of.

We do not have an ISDA master in place with this cpy, however,  Susan Bailey 
and Sara Shackleton did send them a draft in August.  I would think unless 
ECTRIC is going to be a direct cpy to a master, Craig Young should contact 
Susan and Sara directly...?

I just got a call from the online team, and there is a rush push on from 
London to get this counterparty approved ASAP.  Since you are the key person, 
I thought I'd pull you into the loop.  This counterparty should be coming 
thru on tomorrow's approval list.  I know you've got to do your due 
diligence, so if you could let me know how long it will take to get back to 
me I can let the EOL and London people know.  Much thanks!

I just wanted to confirm with you that all fuel & liquids customers, 
including those from Singapore, are being handled by credit in Houston now 
that the responsibility for Global Products has moved from London to Houston. 
I spoke with Sheri Thomas & Tom Moran (Houston credit) this morning & they 
both agreed that these (Asia Pacific) counterparties should now be handled by 
Houston. However there still appears to be some confusion over this issue so 
I would appreciate it if you could send a reply confirming that this is the 
understanding at your end so as to avoid any further confusion.

Many thanks

I spoke with Frank Davis in Houston yesterday about this PA and he agreed 
that Houston PCG would ensure that this customer was reviewed in Houston and 
set up as soon as possible.  I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita 
Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when 
processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG 
except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal 
in London.

It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further 
between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites 
further. Hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not 
occur again and delay the processing of a customer application.

Bo,

I put Idemitsu's PA into the database  for credit review on Sept 26 & it was 
picked up by John Suttle in Houston. I haven't heard anything since & seeing 
as they appear to be a fuel & oils customer I have today changed the RAC to 
London so that the PA can be processed over there, which is probably where it 
should have gone in the first place. I apologise for the delay and 
inconvenience however there was initially some confusion between myself & 
Houston as to where Asia Pacific fuel & oil customers should be processed.

Idemitsu Kosan in Japan sent in a PA on 29 Sept to your office.

Bo Petersen of our Global Products team has been getting calls from them 
wanting to know the status of their PA as they are very anxious to get online.

The database says 'Credit Reviewing' - can you please feed back any comments 
or updates to Bo and the London PCG directly?  I will be out of the office on 
Monday and want to ensure that Bo knows what to tell the customer should they 
call again.

Thank you,

Per Jane's email, I think we can definitely approve them to trade Japanese 
products.  I want to confirm with her the approval for the rest of the 
products, tho I think they'll probably be OK too.  So today, you could open 
them for Japan.

The address in Paris is the central address from their invoices.  Toulouse is 
a regional office when we find some of the meteroologists are based.
So contractually I think Paris is porbably the best reference.
Hope this helps

   

Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the 
list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at 
the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France 
where we used their Toulouse address.  I just wanted to confirm that the 
address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of 
Paris, not Toulouse.  If you'll just confirm that for me.

Calpine Power:  was already open for financial-no change to that approval

Utilicorp.:  I originally had Enron sales only for power, but Leslie is now 
telling me to open them for all power.

Constellation:  I originally had them shut down for financial, so I am 
opening them up.  I originally had them shut down for power and they should 
stay shut down.

Dear Tana,

I was surprised to see that Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. has not been approved 
for (did not apply for approval for I guess) any Japanese products; in which 
case I wonder why they are using the Japanese parent company and not a US or 
other sub.  As per email yesterday, fine for them to do EOL trading generally 
but could you just check that it is the Japanese entity which has been 
approved and that they will not be doing any Japanese products.

Thanks.

Just following up from our conversation last week.  We continue to do a large 
amount of transactions with this counterparty which are being confirmed 
through our long form agreements without credit terms.  To the extent that 
you decide not to forward the ISDA at this time, please let me know so that I 
can make a determination whether or not we need to reduce trade in order to 
control Enron's credit exposure.  Please let me know the status.

Thanks,
Ed Sacks

Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever 
documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in 
Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will 
take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or 
Mark Frevert to sign.

Euromoney stopped doing their great seminar a few years back.  We have not 
yet found any other seminar that equals it.  I'll keep my eyes posted, 
though.

Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.

You bet.  I faxed a copy out to them earlier this afternoon.  We also faxed a 
copy to London, and hope to get it back signed by EnronCredit.com first thing 
tomorrow morning.

My materials are 6 years old.  Do you think they would be of any benefit?

Do we still have the materials from the workshop that could be forwarded to 
Jane?

	Mark Taylor
	10/25/2000 04:55 PM
		
Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.

hear the scoop...

Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.  I need to give EOL 
responses by Friday for all these counterparties.  In addition, we should 
have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we 
have to approve by Friday.  I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I 
still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.  Thanks!

Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you 
need to talk to Erica...

I'm sorry for the delay.  I looked at the agreement and I have no problem 
with it although, as a lawyer, it is dificult to envision how the English 
courts are going to apply Texas law.  I would like to know what this is about 
as I have no idea.  Can you please give me a call on 34916?  Thanks.

Have been talking to credit.  First set of 24 or so counterparties should be 
coming any moment now.  Second set is being worked on.

Do we have any input from credit on approvals for steel counterparties ?

	
	                           
	

EOL is launching steel on Monday, October 30.

Product types are:

US Steel Hot Rolled Fin Swap
US Steel Cold Rolled Fin Swap 
US Steel Hot-Dipped Galvanized Fin Swap

Deadline:  Need approvals from Credit by Thursday morning, October 26 and 
Contracts and Legal by Friday afternoon, October 27.

The attached excel spreadsheet contains the targeted customer list.  Please 
note that there are 4 worksheet tabs.

I know this is short notice, but as you can see below, we just received the 
list today.

Michael Slade forwarded me your advice  with respect to the Non-Disclosure 
Agreement with i2 Technologies.  We appreciate your help on this.  Per my 
conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many 
coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and 
pursuing US based customers.  We wanted to confirm with you that on a going 
forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees 
executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.  Thanks for your 
help with this.

We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among 

Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in 
Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA 
out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.  
She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's 
provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of 
contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

To draft an NDA I will need the following information:

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to 
send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.

I look forward to working with you!

he's on a plane back to the US right now, I'll have to get these to you guys 
tomorrow.

Thanks.

FYI
We do not have Australia, Bermuda, Chile, Japan & Peru - PCG Houston should 
be able to help with those.

Thanks

Jason,

As we discussed, please route the message below to the approriate IT person 
to retrieve the ETAs referenced.

Thank you.
Travis needs to get copies of the ETA's below.  I don't know if there is 
someone here in Houston that can get them for him, or someone in London.  I 
usually would have called Edmund on this but he's out sick for awhile.  Can 
you track it down for us?  Thanks!

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

Regards,

-Dovie

Attached is the one way (counterparty) only form you requuested.

	Bruce Harris@ENRON
	10/26/2000 12:29 PM
		
Actually, can we amend it so that it is "unilateral" on the part of Enron (we 
agree not to disclose information they give us, but not the other way 
around)?  EnronCredit is not providing Duke with any confidential 
information, our pricing information is very public and I don't want them 
worrying about them breaching a CA when they are using our pricing.

Regards,  Bruce

Attached is our proposed form of NDA.  Let me know if you have any questions 
or if I can be of further service.

Just a note re: "Miller Balish O'Neil PC" on the list from the 25th.  I just 
had a conversation with Mark about that one, it sounds awfully like a law 
firm to us.  Unless a member of the Legal Dept. requests a guest ID for a law 
firm doing legal research for us, we should never grant guest ID's to a law 
firm.  It can only hurt us!  It's possible it could be an accounting firm.  
Per Mark, we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either.  "PC" 
(for professional corporation) is a good giveaway that we might have one or 
the other.

We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated 10/26/00.  Copies will be distributed.

I really appreciate your help!

PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure 
that they can trade it under the GISB.  They want to amend the ETA to that 
effect.  I'm not sure how we want to handle this.  Get Stacy/Jeff's approval 
that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?  The

Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only
outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com
Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.

My fax number is 0207 330 9999.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind regards,

I bet you thought I forgot about you?!

The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the
phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed
form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit
would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being
done.  If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees
you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.

Tana:

Stacy needs to talk with her to decide if it's appropriate to trade under the 
GISB.  If she agrees, we shouldn't need to amend the ETA -- the GISB will 
become an "applicable master" under the terms of the ETA and all nat gas 
transactions eligible for trading under the GISB would be confirmed under the 
GISB contract, to the extent the nat gas group sends confirms.  Give Denise a 
call back and let her know to expect a call from Stacy.

Stacy:

Please all this woman and discuss her request re the GISB agreement.  Then, 
give me a call so that we can discuss your determination and to make sure I 
can respond accurately to her ETA concern.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  You 
should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access 
only.  They should not see our comments.  That information is confidential 
and subject to attorney/client privilege).   Let me know if you do not have 
edit access.  Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside 
your area of responsibility.  A few notes...

There is some great reporting functionality in this database.  Check out some 
of the sorts on the left.  There is a drop down called "Pending Swap 
Update".  That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial 
agreements.  There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate 
reports for you compan

The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are 
critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.  Kinda, before you do/authorize 
a trade read this.  Not for general legal notes.  

Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded 
elsewise (it will mess up reporting).  If you are amending an agreement or 
superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".

 I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs.  
If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.  

Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up

Per our conversation, this link will get you access into the Master Swap

A few news flashes re: limitations on products:

1.  The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina 
counterparties.  They have licensing requirements similar to US physical 
power.  All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut 
down for this product.

Tana-

Here are the companies that we are currently talking with that require an 
NDA.  I believe that all of these are covered under NDA via EBS.

I assume it's common practice to have to go through this process due to our 
group's move from one company to another, but have been asked by one of our 
originators if there's a way to work around it;  the point being that it's an 
inconvenience to the counterparty to jump through another hoop because of our 
situation.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!

I was asked to contact you regarding your proposed confidentiality
agreement.

As drafted, we think the confidentiality agreement is overly broad, and
potentially could limit our ability to speak with and participate in other
ECNs.  Consequently, I suggest that we create a definition as to what items
specifically constitute confidential information, and attach a list of those
items as a schedule to the agreement.  Using this methodology, we prevent
putting ourselves in the position where we need to worry about the broad
definition currently contained in your agreement every time we speak with a
competing ECN.

If you wish to discuss this matter further, I can be reached at (212)
566-9647.

	Molly Harris
	10/18/2000 06:37 PM
		
From a Credit perspective, I informed Allison that credit provisions are not 
required for these particular deals since I learned of the trades 2 days ago 
(after the deals had been executed without our approval upfront).   Credit 
believes it does not make sense to execute stand alone financial deals.  
These deals should be executed as amendments to the pricing component of the 
physical contracts (i.e., a restructuring).  This process would mitigate the 
operational, credit and legal risks of this proposed business.  My 
understanding of the business strategy of EES is to enter into financial 
transactions to hedge the portfolio, not to execute financial trades with end 
users.  Please advise if the legal position is changing.

Assuming we are unable to achieve the aforementioned solution, these deals 
raise more significant issues regarding support and control of new business 
endeavors for EES which already has significant infrastructure and control 
issues.  It raises issues to be resolved on:

Credit approval and monitoring
Credit provisions
Legal support in EES with financial and ISDA experience
Netting issues and additional credit risk from having multiple masters with 
our clients (physical and financial)
Execution of masters post trade execution
Capturing and monitoring these OTC financial trades separate from financial 
settlements of physical trades
Managing portfolio position risk
Operational issues capturing and properly valuing the trades
Operational support for confirmations and ensuring timely execution

In short, we need to establish processes to support this business.  I will 
set up a meeting with relevant parties to discuss further.

In respect to the attached confirmations for Springs, additional questions 
should be raised with regard to operational/billing and legal implications 
for consolidated billing of financial and physical invoices.  This has been 
specified in the payment date.  Is EES capable of accomplishing this 
operationally today?  Doesn't this raise legal issues of consolidated billing 
and settlements under two different contracts which do not stipulate netting 
(physical with financial)?

Regards
Molly

I'm sure you all know this by now, by Molly Harris had told me this deal does 
not need any additonal credit terms added.

offered to help us draft the Credit attachment if we give her the details. 
Again, I am turning my file over to Karen Cordova while I am on vacation, and 
the confirmations are located under J:\Legal\SWAPs\Sales. Thanks and see you

Re:  Enron Corp.

 We have received a letter agreement from Bank of America setting forth the 
terms of the referenced merger as they relate to our ISDA Master Agreements 
currently in place with Enron Corp. and each of  Bank of America and 
NationsBank.  Credit and Legal have agreed to the terms set forth therein.
 
1. On July 5, 1999, NationsBank, N.A. ("NationsBank") changed its name to 
Bank of America, N.A.
2. On July 23, 1999, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association 
("BofA") merged with Bank of America,  N.A. and the surviving bank is named 
Bank of America, National Association.

Effective July 23, 1999, as a result of the merger, the following will 
occurr:  

1. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 8, 1995,  between Enron Corp. 
and  and NationsBank, N.A.  will remain in place.  Bank of America, National

Justy,

We are going to be trading with Deutsche Bank out of their New York and 
London branch offices online.  Per my conv. w/the online team, we going to 
have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we 
haven't solved multibranch customers online).  With Edmund out, I need 
someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password 
Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA 
Master with.  Can you have someone there send me the docs.

Much thanks...

We have received the originally executed Participant Agreements dated

I spoke to Ed Sacks in Credit re: AEP.  We have an ISDA in place with AEP 
Energy Services, Inc.  When they trade under that master they are trading for 
their own account.  When they trade as American Electric Power Service 
Corporation they are actually trading as the service company for the family 
of utilities under their umbrella.  So it's 2 different counterparties.

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the

The following CPs are not authorized to trade US power:

CMS Field Services, Inc. 
Howell Corporation -- restricted by credit
Massachusetts Electric Company -- they sound like a utility, but they are not 
a current CP and not on my FERC lists of utilities or marketers.  
Navajo Tribal Utility Authority -- not a current CP/not on my FERC lists

NOTE:  Can you get me a contact for Mass. Electric or Navajo so that I can 
discuss with them whether they are authorized to trade power.
****************************

City of Burbank is authorized to trade West power products only pursuant to 
the WSPP Agreement.
NOTE:  Credit has them set up for P only in the West -- I'm not sure why they 
are thus restricted.

that originate from Houston Credit.  London has their own lists of 
counterparties I never see.  Do you think we need to get them to forward all 
lists with Japanese & Australian counterparties to you and Jane for approval?

I haven't seen or heard anything on this...

The above counterparty is a really old one that appears to have come online 
before we opened up financial power for trading.  It appears they never got 
opened up when it came online.  Can we add them to tomorrow's list to open 
them for financial power.  Much thanks!

My last notes on Denmark from Edmund were due diligence pending.  What's the 
scoop on commodity derivatives, weather derivatives, credit derivatives, 
derivatives in general.  Any restrictions on any other products?

Thanks for your voicemail re:  Enron Metals.  I'll give you a call in the 
morning when I get in.

I miss my Justy...

For Massachusetts Electric Company and Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  
you'll notice they want to trade power and we're shutting them down.  Leslie 
has to call the counterparties and talk to them about their power status.  
They're not showing up on the FERC approved lists, so Leslie has to figure 
out how/if they can trade power.

Yes!

Tana-

Here are the companies that we are currently talking with that require an 
NDA.  I believe that all of these are covered under NDA via EBS.

I assume it's common practice to have to go through this process due to our 
group's move from one company to another, but have been asked by one of our 
originators if there's a way to work around it;  the point being that it's an 
inconvenience to the counterparty to jump through another hoop because of our 
situation.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!

I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and 
QuickQuote.com in order to 
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron 
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent 
questions that may need your
legal opinion.

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

Ron Nolte
10/16/2000 12:37 PM
Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Whichever Enron entity  offers that product on EnronOnline 
will be the party for these trades as well.  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com 
logo? No.  The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was 
done but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?  
Same process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it 
should be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch.

 

Tana, 

Please remove my name from this distribution and add Connie  Sutton.  I have 
changed groups to the Gas Asset Team. 

Thanks,
Melissa

   

We have received the following executed documents from counterparty:

1.  First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 04/27/99 between ECT 
and Engage Energy US, L.P. (i) making certain changes to setoff provisions 
and (ii) changing Counterparty's exposure threshold; and

2.  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) between ECT Canada and 
Engage Energy Canada, L.P. executed 05/03/99, effective as of 01/31/97.

Copies will be distributed.

Per Leslie Hansen, above counterparty will not be approved to trade power 
online.  She said she spoke to counterparty and they are a distribution 
company and not FERC approved to sell power.  So we will not change that 
profile.

I am looking for the merger documents dated 12/30/99 wherein Devon Energy 
Corp. merged with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., and PennzEnergy 
Exploration and Production Company, L.L.C.  If you've got a copy can you fax 
it to me via 646-3490.  Thanks!

Q74562.1
Q74565.1

These deals will have a status of "Pending - Sent to Legal" until I hear back

"oops" trades...
	Kevin Meredith@ENRON

These are all Enron Online deals.  Evidently, the Coral traders are logging 
into EOL incorrectly.  We have one other deal that Joe Hunter emailed you 
previously.  I am uncertain whether or not the Coral traders can be prevented 
from logging in as Coral Energy Resources.

Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  Per Leslie, not a FERC approved 
counterparty.  This cpy can have read-only access for US power products.  
Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested

have to follow up with them re: their FERC approved status at that time.

Just an update on the status of the signing.  As of Friday, Duke supposedly 
had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't 
like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty.  
Clement Abrams,  Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning 
and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their 
concerns.  He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and 
give me the original for transmittal.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress...

Are these physical, financial or both?

Please try and open up HQ Energy Services ASAP.  

Gaylord Container is shut down by Credit, but it should be open, so it is 
going to come back thru as an amended counterparty.

The above counterparty should be coming on tonight's list.  We would like to 
open them for gas ASAP, and Credit is reviewing the financials now to give 
them some headroom on power.  If you could let me know ASAP whether you have 
any issues.

via the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or sell 
Bandwidth Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to the 
Demarcation Point located at each Market Pooling Point in order to take 
physical delivery of such Bandwidth.  In order to achieve such connectivity, 
a party may incur costs and expenses and may additionally be required to 
execute certain documentation.
The Term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effective 
Date and continue to 11:59: 59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The 
Effective Date is 01 Nov 2000 and the Termination Date is 30 Apr 2001.
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling 
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462, 
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the London Market Pooling Point (Telecity 2, 8-9 
Harbour Exchange, 1st Floor, Room 1T, London, E14 9GE),  for a total of 3,471 
DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the Unit Price is quoted is one DSO mile 
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per 
month. Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: Price x 
the  number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DSO miles x the 
number of Bandwidth Units.

Scott,

Can you pass on Mary Solmonson's memo to the appropriate London lawyer 
responsible for Norway power contracts.  Mary is the head of Global Contracts 
here in Houston, and Phillipe Travis works for Mary, and just went over to 
London to work on getting systems in place for Global Contracts in London.

Thanks for your help!
Mary Solmonson

Philippe has uncovered a group of contracts in Norwegian that are not 
translated in English at all.  Here is his note :

Norwegian Power Contracts have not been translated into English.  This has 
not been an issue for the Power Deal Clearing and Documentation Group because 
Ellen Wallumrod is from Norway.  She is able to make 'confirms' in her native 
tongue.  However, this is an issue from Global Contracts because no one can 
speak Norwegian! 
I have spoken with translation companies regarding translation fees.  It is 
very costly to have all of the contracts translated.  There are perhaps a 
dozen contracts.  Should legal cover the translation expenses?  Ian believes 
that only parts of the contract need to be translated.  But, how do I know 
which parts need to be translated?  And, with Auditors in mind, shouldn't we 
have English copies on hand?

Do we need to have a complete English version ?

If not, would it be acceptable to translate only certain paragraphs ?

Should we (Global Contracts) target building a multi-lingual staff for the 
future - esp. in London office ?

Got any ideas or opinions ?

OK for me.

ANP Power Marketing Company is NOT a current counterparty and is not on my

are free to call me to discuss if they are FERC approved.)

Hi Matt-   

SIGMA FACTOR REQUEST:
Commercial has requested the following new Bandwidth product on EOL.  The 
product type is similar to a the other Bandwidth products currently listed on 
EnronOnline.

New Product TypeCommodity:  
Product Type:   US Bandwidth STM-1 Phy Fwd
Commodity: Bandwidth 
Currency:     USD
Default UOM:   DSO miles
Country:   USA

Product: STM-1
Market Pooling Point Locations: New York to London (NY-LON)
DS0s: 2016
Miles: 3471

Physical Description :
A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") 
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity 
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of 
DSO's per STM-1 is 2016. The price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty 
via the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or sell 
Bandwidth Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to the 
Demarcation Point located at each Market Pooling Point in order to take 
physical delivery of such Bandwidth.  In order to achieve such connectivity, 
a party may incur costs and expenses and may additionally be required to 
execute certain documentation.
The Term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effective 
Date and continue to 11:59: 59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The 
Effective Date is 01 Nov 2000 and the Termination Date is 30 Apr 2001.
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling

month. Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: Price x 
the  number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DSO miles x the 
number of Bandwidth Units.

I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the 
attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.  There was also a few 
updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.  If and when Mark 
calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, 
because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it.

I'm talking to their lawyer right now.  He's checking with his power team to 
find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a 
Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power

US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited 
liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some 
legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any 
financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible 
swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) 
and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, 
we have no problem with limited liability companies.

In Justin's absence, please could you let me know if we would be able to 
consider an application from a Limited Liability Company organized under the 
laws of the State of Connecticut, USA?  If possible, could you provide me 
with an answer on this today or latest tomorrow as this customer is coming in 
to the office on Thursday?  The history behind this customer is that the 
original company that Mr Papaeconomou wanted to trade under (NEWCO) was 
incorporated in Liberia.  As we do not have the relevant documentation to 
support trading from Liberia we rejected his application.  This would be a 
good customer for Andy James (Seafreight) to get online and Mr Papaeconomou 
is obviously very keen to obtain execute access as soon as possible through a 
viable company.

Thanks

Anna
Dear Mrs. Gardiner,

Thank you very much for your message dated November 6, 2000.  Given the
present legal constraints concerning companies incorporated in Liberia,
would EnronOnline consider an application by a Limited Liability Company
organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut?  If yes would you
please provide the relevant documentation for such entity?

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

meet with Andy James of Enron Shipping at 3PM.  Should you be available
before or after my appointment, I would very much appreciate to meet you in

with EnronOnline (beyond the company jurisdiction requirement which I hope
would now be solved!)

to trade power but so far Credit has not given them any headroom for power 
and they do not appear to have a FERC license in this name.  We are working

Hi Tana,

For our ISDA with the above referenced counterparty, can you tell me
if we (ENA) are supposed to be the confirming party or is it Soc Gen?

They've been sending us a lot of their confirms lately (in the Emerging
Products world, that is....Weather transactions) and are expecting us
to sign their confirms.   I'd like to confirm that our ISDA says We confirm
before I go back to them.

Thanks,
Diane

We do have an ISDA Agreement in place between Koch Energy Trading and ENA, 
but Anthony is correct on a number of accounts.  First, we could not put Oslo 
trades under this master.  It is a Local Currency form and could not be used 
for any non US transaction. Second, it is quite old and our forms have 
evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form.  Lastly, it 
has the old "ERMS" style collateral annex, and we would want to use an ISDA 
Credit Support Annex on a going forward basis.  I would suggest contacting 
Matt Dawson in London Legal and Rod Nelson in London Credit and getting a new 
master based off our current form.

Hi Yumi,

Yes I realise the entities are going to be different if this turns out to be 
a ENA ISDA but the by already having an ISDA with the counterparty we can 
quicken the negotiation process, i.e. 'mirroring' the contract as you say, 
and having the correct entities in place. Thats what I am proposing we do. 
This is something we'll need to work with Martin on.

Thanks

Matthew

Hi Matt,

I believe we may need to set up a new ISDA since ECTRIC is a different entity 
than ENA.  In the past we have mirrored an existing ENA ISDA in order to 
create one between the CP and ECTRIC.  However, I'll wait to turn in any 
requests until I hear what we already have with Koch.

Thank you,
Yumi

   
	
	

Hi Anthony,

Can you do me a favour and take a look into this ISDA. The traders in our 
Oslo office have done a weather deal with Koch Energy Trading Inc.  The 
counterparty mentioned they had an ISDA in place with ECTRIC. We are trading 
as ECTRIC.   But maybe the CP was confused and thought it was ECTRIC instead 
of ENA.

The trader here said she plans to do many more future trades with Koch, and 
has been asking if we can amend the ENA ISDA to cover Oslo.

If you can just confirm what you've got, whats covered etc and if possible 
send through a copy and I can liaise with Oslo and our legal dept to get them 
covered.

Thanks

Matt,

I spoke to Matthew Dawson, and he said there is an old ISDA out there, with 
an effective & contract date of 23 May 1994 with ECT.
It was apparently negotiated in Houston, and the contact there is Tana Jones.

There is no copy here in London, but Matt said he would ask Tana, if we could 
see one.

Regards
Stephen  (Ext:34716)

   
	
	

Steve,

Do we have anything out there for this....should be an ISDA.

Dig out anything and everything we've got and send it through 

cheers

and the last I have is a copy of the docs sent to Avista by you in
10/98.  Thanks

A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global 
Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the 
master with us and trade(s) thereunder.  He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1.  
I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this 
trades, but you might want to give them a call.  Jim McClymont at (308)

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

Patti

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated October 31, 

We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't 
think we use it to trade under anymore.  I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it 
appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  If you 
concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get 
attached for online trading.

I understand from speaking with Andy Zipper that he has invited you to submit

Per my conv. w/Tanya, the above master should be inactived (which I have 
already done in Lotus Notes) and taken off the executed Master List.  All the 
Dynegy Trading is done out of Dynegy Marketing and Trade.

Thanks.

Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is 
there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the 
middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.

It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news 
station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say 
I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've 
been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party 
system.  That was a good thought.

I think we should order 8 mens shirts in large.  So I don't think you need to

Attached is that chart that were supposed to replace with the current one on 
price volatility.  I tried to open it up, but it was all gobbeldy gook.  
Maybe you could print it out for me and then I could take a look at it and if 
it looks OK we could just replace it with existing one.  Thanks!

Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we 
will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add 
the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of 
"Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron 
entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly 
default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we 
are trying to carve those transactions out.  

Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB 
agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from 
the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised 
draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.

Tana,

Hope you are well.  I wondered whether you had had any progress on the final
form of the Deutsche Schedule yet? or any progress on the FUNB documents?
Thanks for your help in keeping us up to date on the status here.

Best regards,

Clare

Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Unfortunately,
the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn
around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.

Tana,

Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the
only
outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for
EnronCredit.com
Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.

My fax number is 0207 330 9999.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Kind regards,

Clare

I bet you thought I forgot about you?!

The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the
phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed
form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit
would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being
done.  If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees
you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.

                    Clare.Godson@Alle

We just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from

chance to confirm they made all the changes.

someone at Enron in London and they had misspelled it for me.

Thanks again for all your help.

Clare,

Thanks for your note.  Your e-mail trouble is due to the spelling of Tana's

Jennifer McQuade with EOL called checking on the status of your conv. 
w/Elzear Lemieux with cpy.  Have you resolved the ETA questions yet?

I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he 
checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he 
gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause 
any problems...

I actually received the last document I need to put otgether binders this 
week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.

So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can 
return the hospitality.

Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents 
on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together, 
can you send a copy to me for our files.  Thanks!

My favorite election comment to date comes from Gore who said today he was 
not "focused on the contest, but our democracy".  Such a thoughtful, selfless 
person!

For this list of amends, my comments mean:

Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should 
have no impact on my prior approvals.
Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas)
Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's 
changes.

Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response.  
Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.  Per your 
voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have 
reviewed.  I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I 
will hear from him tonight or not.  If youcould email or fax me the 
document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I 
hear back from him.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate 
moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark. 

I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to

Per a call from Rod today, our executed master list hasn't picked up the

Its NOT a name change, the Two calpine companies are merging and the survivor 
company is Calpine Energy Services. Calpine Power record will be inactivated 
on the 1st of next month. Merger docs had been forwarded to you. If not give 
Cheryl Johnson a call and she can forward that.

For RAG......At the time I sent out the spreadsheet in order to meet the EOL 
deadline the GCP system showed the old name. Now the system had been updated 
by Cheryl to reflect the correct name. For further details, on that contact 
Karen Lambert since we have to send the spreadsheet out ASAP everyday to her, 
by a certain time, with the information as it appears in GCP.

P.S. Check in GCP System since thats the most updated information you can 
find. If a name change, merger or acquisition is in process, CHERYL JOHNSON 
or MARILYN COLBERT would know best why?

If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of

Anyone have these merger docs?

Calpine Power Services Company merged into Calpine Energy Services, L.P. eff 
11/1/00, with the survivor being Calpine Energy Services, L.P. Copies of the 
documents were hand carried to legal by Anthony Campos on 11/9. I believe he 
gave them to Lisa. I am not certain why you have not received them yet. 
Please check with her and then let me know if there is anything more I can 
do. Thanks! MC

So, back to my original question, is this a name change?
	Adnan Patel@ENRON
	11/14/2000 09:59 AM
		 
Please contact Cheryl or Marilyn Colbert for any name change, mergers, 
acquisition documents
Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services 
Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial 
master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at 
713/636-3490.  Thanks!

But I did respond.  I said "yeah!" on the thermostat.  You're confusing 
me...I don't know where Michelle is.  She should be in town.  She must just 
be busy at work.

Why are you responding without responding? Do you know where Michelle is. I
think she's hiding.

Louis

Thanks! I think I can meet you on Friday and I did some research and found a
thermostat that switches automatically.

Louis

I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to
meet the stove repair guy.  Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean
up day?

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as "parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Peter.

As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of 
the paralegals in the financial trading group:

We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie 
Panus.  Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron 
Broadband.  Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group:

Tana Jones:  Primarily all EnronOnline issues.  (1) I am the primary Legal 
contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.  Individual contract 
problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical 
gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.  (2) As my 
time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with 
my name on, feel free to call me.

Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions:  Can be directed to any 
of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.

Copies of Executed Masters:  Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, 
she can get you copies.

Merger/Name Changes:  Stephanie Panus

Executed Master List:  Susan Bailey

I hope this straightens things out!

OK for me!

This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.  We have received documentation 
that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an 
ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., 
an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.   Is Credit OK with this 
merger?

I am sending down this list, with all counterparties approved except Calpine, 
which I am still waiting on Credit approval on the Calpine Power 
Services/Energy Services merger.  As soon as I get their sign off I will send 
down an amended spreadsheet.

Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of 
State effective 11/1/00, Calpine Power Services Company, a California 
corporation has been merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., a 
Delaware corporation.  The ISDA Master Agreement with Calpine Power Services 
Company dated 10/20/99 will be changed accordingly.

Attached is the Annex B for Catalytica.

Nope, it's a merger.

I believe that this was authored by James Carville:

NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"
said the Mets batting coach.  "We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the 
Mets
batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said

a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment."

the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said

a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment."

I believe that this was authored by James Carville:

NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"
said the Mets batting coach.  "We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the 
Mets
batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said

a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment."

Hi Tana -

We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
date:

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)

Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.

Many thanks

Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross 
numbers to match my list:  "Net long or short position in all months 
combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or 
Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, 
with the positions not netted out.

At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry 
passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.  P.S.  Do we have

Very good stuff.  I will get back to you later.

Jon Chapman
11/15/2000 09:37 AM
I'm afraid I'm still none the wiser . Anyway , points of history : (1) Yes , 
we did , technically , lose the American War of Independence but it was 
because we got sick of it and had other "fish to fry" in Asia and Africa , 
plus it was really a civil war because the people who "beat" us were , 
largely , first or second generation "Americans" and , therefore ,  Brits 
(for example , George Washington's family home is still there close to my 
home town of Sunderland in North-East England ) and (2) we never lost to the 
French , we agreed to give them the worst bit - Quebec - in return for some 
tastier possessions elsewhere .

Yours respectfully

Jon

   

That fact that you asked "who?" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

Peter. 

Jon Chapman
11/15/2000 06:43 AM
Who or what the ****ing hell is San Felipe - I don't remember the Brits ever 
winning a battle there .

Jon

   

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as "parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Peter.

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per 
Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not 
business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product 
areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 
12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant 
Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our 
Legal sign off by Friday.

I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached 
descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in 
his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark 
asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper 
description for our group.

Thanks for your help!

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.

If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to 
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence,effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over 
all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah, which she does 
not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside 
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for 
further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire 
will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules 
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then 
look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at 
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise 
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary".  Using the same 
twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you 
know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up
"interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on 
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.  It 
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good 
guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should
instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with 
the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, 
be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does 
not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar 
body armour like nancies).We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby 
sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they 
give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a 
world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The Russians have 
never been the bad guys."Merde" is French for "sh*t".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new 
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called "Indecisive Day".

9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your own 
good.  When we show you German cars,  you will understand what we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to 
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence,effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over 
all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah, which she does 
not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside 
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for 
further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire 
will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules 
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then 
look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at 
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise 
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary".  Using the same 
twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you 
know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up
"interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on 
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.  It 
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good 
guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should
instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with

he can initial them and I will then get them signed.

Many thanks,

Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your

Dune, I've reviewed the NDA and all of their changes are acceptable, except:

--  The additions to the two sentences in Section 1 don't make sense as
written, so should be restated as follows:
Any written Confidential Information will be clearly labeled "Confidential
Information" or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.  Any Confidential Information transmitted orally will be
clearly identified as such by the Party disclosing such information at the
time it is disclosed or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.

--  We can't agree to the new language in Section 10.

Feel free to forward my comments to Enron if you would like.  I would have
revised the CDA accordingly, but they use a different redlining system than we
do.

Thanks.

Attached are ClickPaper approvals for November 20, 2000.  Please note that 
the credit limits in the spreadsheet reflect one-tenth of the actual credit 
limit that we have assigned for a given counterparty since the headroom 
within ClickPaper is calculated using Sigma Factor * Volume rather than 
Pprice * Volume.  We will assign all future limits by using one-tenth of the 
assigned credit limit since using the Sigma factor in these calculations 
generates a value of roughly one-tenth of the full limit.  Hopefully this 
will eliminate some of the recent problems we've had with counterparties 
busting their credit limits.  Please call or send a note if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

The solution is to set up a dedicated US entity, which we are working on.

Thanks Tana - Cindy please could you put a Power of Attorney in place for 
Jeff Kinneman to sign, say confidentiality agreements and letters of intent 
(for now) on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited?
Please let me know if you need more details.

Many thanks

Michael

Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever 
documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in 
Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will 
take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or 
Mark Frevert to sign.  

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have recently upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

Can you please give Greg Johnston, Peter Keohane and Mark Powell, lawyers in 
our Calgary office, as well as their assistants Linda Sietzema and Sharon 
Crawford,  full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreements database.  
Can you please let me know when their access has been granted.

Thanks!

Per our discussion, the email for that website is www.utilityconnection.com.  

Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though 
we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still 
considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to 
talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.

Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about 
pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether 
they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their 
lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their 
business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you 
about potential metals customers?

Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?

Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down 
Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when 
he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?

As usual, you're the best!

The attached legal name changes have been made in GCP.  The CXY Marketing 
entities and Canadian Occidental records were overlayed due to a name change 
to Deven.  See attachment for details.

.

On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the 
counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like 
Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative 
corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).  It helps me and some of the 
non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..

On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, 
but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.  If 
we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number 
of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.

For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them 
open for all financial except Australian power.  (Also, shutting down 
Argentina gas...)

Matt,

Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for 
Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have 
(like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):

Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals)
Weather Derivatives
Credit Derivatives

Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade 
any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to 
attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products 
we trade.

Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in 
Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for 
no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required 
before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.

Tana, I will be on leave until 2 January 2001. Over that period I have made 
arrangements for the legal review of the daily EOL credit responses to be 
reviewed  outside counsel. Accordingly over that period would you forward the 
daily spreadsheets to my admin. assistant Alison Keogh. She will then 
coordinate the review. Whilst counsel have been briefed on the process and 
what is expected of them  it would be of assistance if you would continue 
your current practice of highlighting in your covering email any particular 
counterparties on which you would like a response from us.

   

Matt,

 As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online 
Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all 
products.  I am asking because until recently I have not been approving 
Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.  It has been my 
understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading 
physical products.  I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore 
incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a 
real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.  Should that be 
my continuing practice?

Hi Tana

Trust you are well.

OTC derivatives are not regulated in Singapore. The issue is whether a 
particular product type may infringe gaming or insurance regulations. This is 
particularly pertinent to Weather and Credit, for which I would need to 
consult external counsel for definite answers. Is there a new commercial push 
to do so at this time? We haven't any Weather and Credit traders here in 
Singapore.

As for metals, if they are exchange traded futures contracts (eg. London 
Metals Exchange contracts), the trading of gold would be regulated.

There is no category of counterparty that would be particularly problematic. 
Capacity issues would be determined by each company's constitutional 
documents.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Matt

It was good to hear from you!

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just 
me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or 
roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same 
joy in cooking it would be elsewise.

It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called 
"African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.  
It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She 
had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see 
why you can know everyone elses hands!).

I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I 
think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, 
he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going 
to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed 
his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small 
apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And 
his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over 
the baby.

I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the 
new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs 
"guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is 
pretty cozy.

As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I 
couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of 
us.  But, I guess, it's a start...

I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight 
comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  

It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!

I don't understand, what do you mean by "log in an email"?

Anyway, I got you message, and I got the World Series thing (although I had
already received

Chris and Ben did a marvelous job for Thanksgiving, I can testify that it was
one of the best Thanksgiv8ing Dinners I've ever had (I not gonna tell them 
that,
I don't want them getting swell heads).

Ma said she had a great time in Houston, She was happy to see yourself, as 
well
as C & D.  I think she likes her special room in your house.

Your gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't it be wierd if the baby
gets botn on Jan 5th?)

Why didn't Craig show Ma his appartment?

What do you think about your phone ocnversation with Unlce Ben (he was almost
shocked)?

Are you coming for Xmas?

Gotta go for now.

Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information 
is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring 
it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm 
not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...

No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would 
only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron 
entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want 
any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan 
transaction which has a swap as a component. 

	Richard Sage
	11/30/2000 10:52 AM
		 
If you do add all the entities, does that mean that we would not need to put 
in place a separate agreement for ECCL?
With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you 
do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as 
you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a 
control measure we're OK.

Anthony,

We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that 
prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other 
parties, including, other Enron affiliates.  All requests by non-Enron North 
America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to 
the paralegals in the Swap Group to determine if the agreement will allow us 
to provide copies to such affiliate, or whether we would  need counterparty 
approval to do so.

With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and 
let you know whether they present any problem.

FYI, 

Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank 
Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any 
specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed 
credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in 
place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get 
execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our 
intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making 
any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the 
remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare

Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot 
transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for 
all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only 
consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require 
any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a 
"governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All 
other US products appear to be OK.

We have received the following fully executed documents back from 
EnergyGateway:

1.  Provider Agreement dated 12/04/00.  This Agreement provides that the 
Monthly Membership Fee of $1,500 shall be waived for the first six months of 
the contract, starting November 30, 2000 thru May 31, 2001.

2.  Natural Gas Marketplace General Terms and Conditions dated 11/30/00.

A woman named Janette Bertel at McLaren Energy just left a message for Genia 
who had just sent them a power master, that they also want to get an ISDA 
Master in place with us.  The woman's phone no is 819/986-4616.  If you could 
send up some credit for this, we'd appreciate it!  

The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy 
didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal 
team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before 
they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to 
Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!

Justin & Matt,

Beth Cowan is a member here of the EnronOnline Marketing Team.  Her 
Counterparty, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, would like to get an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with ECTRIC (per Beth, they don't like our form of 
GTC).  We already have a Local Currency form in place with ENA, but 
obviously, that would not be an appropriate form for London to use.  It is 
also on our form of Schedule from 1996, which we wouldn't want to work off of 
either.  In addition, I've checked the Confidentiality Provisions, and they 
do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of 
the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent.  Saying all that, could you 
please help Beth out...

been directed to Edmund Cooper, but we would like to get them online to 
transact and it sounds like they need the ISDA in place first.

Monday?  If you could print it out on EnronCredit.com letterhead and have 
Denis initial it for signature.  Because of time, Leslie can't initial this 
before we execute it, but we promise she will initial it before we send it 
out to the customer.  Then, can you have it executed by an officer of 
EnronCredit.com and return it to me at fax nol 713/646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Here are the next four descriptions.  Per Awais's message below, he is still 
trying to get these by today.  I know it is a little late....let me know if 
this will be an issue.  Please give me your comments so I can coordinate

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.

Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

Awais

   

Awais,

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

I see you two are on the Reliant agreement.  Deedy Russo, who is manager of 
contracts at Reliant, asked if we could contact them about getting an ISDA 
Master in place to replace the old ERMS Agreement.  She siad we should 
contact Janna Lynn Galloway, a paralegal there.  Her number is 713/207-5893.

Can Houston accomplish the below?  London is about to stop sending the Annex 
A (GTC) with their omnibus.  I think this would save a lot of fax headaches 
(and paper) on our end.  Let me know if it's ok and we'll set it up 
immediately.

Thanks,

Amita,

Justin has agreed that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms and 
instead include the following language on the confirms for EnronOnline 
transactions which are governed under GTC (not governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and 
Conditions. For a copy of this agreement, please click on the Product 
Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View GTC".

Justin: Please verify that I have the language correct as per our discussion.

Thank you for the NDA . I would like to clarify that as we do not know what
Enron have in mind we cannot at this stage commit to furnish  information
which may be implied in the first sentence of the document . More
appropriate wording  may be  "in the event of the provision of information

We have received an executed copy of the Non-Disclosure Agreement between 
Analytica, Inc. and Enron Net Works, LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will 
be sent to Dave Samuels and Kal Shah.

We have lots of ISDA's in place with "Southerns", "Southern" who?

Tana - Do we have any ISDAs in place with Southern?

CJG

We have an ISDA Master Agreement (Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction) in 
place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P.  I am a 
little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services 
Agreement.  Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have 
tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade.  
If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending 
it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the 
confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.

	Chris Gaffney
	12/08/2000 09:24 AM
		
Southern Company or Southern Energy North America, Inc. or another trading 
arm of Southern Company.  The reason I ask is because Southern wants to do 
some deals with us in Ontario and I wanted to know if we have already 
negotiated ISDAs with them.

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward to the relevant attorneys the following 
market descriptions.  Obviously, for you, the weather one is yours, I sent 
the pulp & paper to Sara.  We need to review the market descriptions from a 
legal perspective only.  Awais is trying to get them back by today.  Let me 
know if that will present a problem.   He still hasn't got the liquids ones 
written, he says we'll have those by Monday.  I am coordinating the 
responses, so please return any comments you might have to me for transmittal 
to Awais.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel 
no: 44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.

If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

This report does not have volume or prices.  If you need this info, let me 
know.

I would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the ISDA Master 
Agreement we recently executed with this Counterparty to limit their 
financial trading to energy commodity trading only.  This counterparty is NOT 
approved to trade any other products including , but not limited to, weather, 
pulp & paper, plastics, steel, metals, interest rate & currency, fx, or 
credit derivatives.

I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just 
to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless 
we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, 
no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade 
European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar 
to our FERC licensing.

Thanks!

So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm.  
Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would 
be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions.  
Dinner sounds good to me....

Tana,

If you are still interested in doing the Williams Collection do, what would
be a good time for you to go.  We can meet there and then go to dinner.  Or,
you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the
right furniture.  Whatever is convenient for you, please let me know.

Oops, already had to make change!

Can she get it wrong twice within 1 minute?  The answer is YES!

For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because 
neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not 
want that to change.  I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting 
them down for physical gas.

Are you there.  I tried calling and no one picked up.  I'm ready to go...

ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?

Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading 
Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in 
place.

Tana,

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA 
between PG&E and ENA with a C$ confirmation (exactly like the proposed 
Southern transaction).

Please contact Chris or myself with any questions.

thanx,

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B 
of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing 
document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to 
rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such 
that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms 
should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so 
please contact Bill with questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

 

Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill 
today about 3:30 pm our time.  I have the originals and asked her to tell me 
what address she wants me to send the originals to.  I didn't date the front 
page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be 
effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.  I'm working on getting 
the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same 
package, maybe tomorrow.   I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do.

The MAC clauses are attached to the ISDA Master Agreement.  I will have a 
sample copy walked down to you.

My new address is:  1920 Banks St., Houston  77098.  I would love to come to 
your dinner party!

no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade

Per our conversation.

1.  Replace front outdoor light fixture.
2.  Add door numbers to bottom of front door (1920 Banks).
3.  Add door knocker to middle of front  door (cute kitty door knocker!).
4.  Replace light in front sunroom with new light.
5.  Fix window in back sunroom so it locks or closes (I'm afraid it would be 
easy to pry open, and we have had recent robberies in neighborhood).

Attached is another NDA we need to get signed ASAP.  If you could help us 
with this, we'd appreciate it!

With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the 
contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit 
Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer.

Tel: 713 651 4830
Fax: 713 651 4841
james.r.allred@bankofamerica.com 

As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & 
she will be sending you a worksheet. 

I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you 
would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia 
contracts.

Please give me a call if you need anything else. 

Many thanks, 

Soma

The referenced Counterparty wants to trade physical power.  Leslie has signed 
off on them from a Legal standpoint, but Credit still has concerns and has 
assigned them no power headroom.  I spoke to Jeff Mansfield in their Legal 
Dept. and he is going to have his Credit guy call Ed Sacks tomorrow.

Tana will attend.

I have no idea if it was or not.  Would you like to pass it on, or do you 
want me to?  Does he know what's going on?

With respect to the trade done today with Gases y Graneles Liquidos S.A., 
please find attached a Chilean Annex A for an Omnibus form of confirmation.   
Please attach this form and make an election for NY law as the choice of 
law.  Along with the fax of the Confirmation to the Counterparty, please also

via transmission for that contract series will be disregarded.

ALL POSITIONS ARE DEEMED FINAL
Upon completion of all PCS input, all positions will be deemed final.

All,

The Legal/Credit Meeting is CANCELED for today @ 2:00pm.

See you all at the next one.

Susan S. Bailey

Awais

Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.

At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing a clean and redlined copy of the 
Non-Disclosure Agreement revised to include your comment.  If the enclosed 
meets with your approval, please have the agreement executed and return a 
copy to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron 
and return a copy to you via fax.  

Whatever Tom decides to mirror these two new products from, ditto from me!

Laurel Adams provided me your name to help us with the information regarding 
the legal contracts we are needing.  I am forwarding you the request that was 
originally sent to Laurel.  At this time, we would like to review the 
contracts that are listed below as part of our deal test.  As we need to 
complete our testing by Friday the 15th, we would like to review these 
contracts sometime today or tomorrow.  I apologize for the short notice; 
however, we received your name as the contact person yesterday.   Please let 
me know if can help us with this request.  If you have any questions or need 
additional information, please contact me at 3-1951.

Thank you, 

Carrie Richardson

Laurel,

We have been unsuccessful in getting the contract numbers in order to pull 
the contracts for the deals in our deal test.  We have talked with Bridgette 
Anderson and Anthony Campos in Global Contracts to obtain these numbers; 
however, we have had some difficulty.  What we are needing is the ISDA Master 
Agreement, not the system printout, for the dates listed for the following 
deals.

Deal #   Counterparty Name    Date
  
260828   Merrill Lynch International   6/14/00

251012   Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  10/21/96
271926   BMO Nesbitt Burns    For this deal, the system printout of the ISDA 
Master that we received lists the status as          draft with no effective 
date.  Please provide us with an executed agreement for this deal.
310612   National Westminster Bank PLC   1/1/94

In order to wrap up our testing, please provide us with the above information 
by noon on Thursday.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x31951.

Thank you,

Carrie Richardson

Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers 
here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, 
so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business 
groups for approval.  If we are duplicating your work, or doing something 
contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try 
to coordinate our responses.  Otherwise, we will continue the review we are 
doing.

Tana, Steven,  here are the last three descriptions

Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by 
the commercial groups and they are a bit scanty on regulatory in places.
The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

Thanks

Awais

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.

Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

Awais

   

Awais,

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

Taffy, can you please copy these masters for Carrie ASAP.  Thanks.

this audit.

Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of 
law and arbitration language in it.  I send it with a caveat that this draft 
is 2 years old.  The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so 
I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt 
Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the 
choice of law or arbitration language.

Derek,

I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex 
A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the

Tana, Steven,  here are the last three descriptions

Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by 
the commercial groups and they are a bit scanty on regulatory in places.
The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

Thanks

In short it is suggested we have a disclaimer at the front of each 
description as well as a link ot the Legal & Provacy statement.

I do not like the idea of a disclaimer on the front of each description so 
what about putting one at the bottom of the market info page where the names 
of the markets are displayed?

Justin, would this be acceptable.  The Market Info page is a page which lists 
the names of the markets and the user selects the appropriate description 
from there.  Can you suggest an appropriate discliamer to put in?

Thanks

Justin Boyd
01/09/99 11:36
Awais,

Please see below. We should either have a short disclaimer at the end of each 
Market Description, or have a link to the Legal & Privacy Statement.  

We should also date each Market Description.

Justin

Justin,

I have now reviewed the market descriptions. As instructed, I have not
sought advice from Nick O'Neill or Charlotte Stalin on the regulatory issues
which may arise from this. I understand that you will be considering these.

I confirm that there does not appear to be anything obnoxious in these
descriptions. However, I should say that I am not an expert on the subject
matter of the descriptions and therefore, I would only be able to spot very
obvious problems. Clearly, you need to be comfortable that the contents of
them are true and not defamatory. For example, where you have stated that an
entity is a monopoly you must be sure that this is the case.

Ideally, you should have a statement on the screen that this is provided for
information purposes only and should not be relied on. If this is
unacceptable (and ideally in addition to that statement), there should be a
link to the legal and privacy statement.

Kind regards.

Andrew

the descriptions were written by the commercial groups themselves on the 
whole.  So There should not be any consern fromt he business.  What I was 
going to do is give the final descriptions after Legal and Regulatory 
amendments to them again for final OK.

Awais

Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.

I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney 
in our group, Shari Stack.  If that is the one you are talking about, it 
should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling 
Steve Kean and see if I get a response.

Shari, Can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know 
if its ok.  Thanks.
Awais Omar

Tana,  the one I am talking about is the one in the attached mail from Steven 
Vu.  This was sent this morning.  Shari sent his on Friday and it is differen 
tot his one.

Awais:

You should have received our market description from Shari this morning.  
Lynda asked me on Friday to add some more to the content, and the attached 
file has these changes.  If it is not too late, please use the attached file 
as our market descriptor.

Awais,

should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling

I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all 
these descriptions done was the end of today.  She said she would pass the 
word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.  Let me know if 
that doesn't happen.

Either day is fine for me.

De nada!

I guess I still need your market descriptions for LPG, Oil & Oil Products and 
Plastics and Petrochem.  Will I have them by the end of the day?

Thanks Shari!

Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.  My goal is to get 
everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve 
before I have to file by June 11th.  When the financials are ready I need to 
get them certified by the highest accounting officer.  Last year that was 
Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting.  
Will he be signing again?

I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve 
Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to 
legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney 
in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her 
comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I 
receive your comments.

Were you serious about our conversation Friday, or were you kidding me?  If 
you were serious I'd like to talk to you about it.

After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the 
products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received 
it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me

numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks!

Attached is the latest version of the counterparty/product type matrix.  The 
matrix consist of four colour coded counterparty sections.

Section 1 (white) is the fully approved list from credit with limits noted. 
Section 2 (green) is a second approved list from credit which does not have 
limits noted, yet (credit work in progress). 
Section 3 (blue) consist of counterparties included in the external marketing 
company mailshot, but have not been reviewed by credit, legal, or tax. 
Section 4 (orange) includes counterparties received from the originators & 
marketers that will be manually mailed on Sept 13, but have not yet been 
reviewed by credit, legal, or tax.

The product types at the top (row 10) of the matrix have been updated also to 
the "final" upload version.  Some product types have been deleted and some 
have been added.  The product types that have been added are highlighted in 
yellow.

All of the counterparties on this matrix will be mailed a brochure on 
September 13.  (High credit risk counterparties from section 4 will be pulled 
if we receive notice immediately)  This should be the final pre-launch 
counterparty matrix and will serve as the goal for pre approved 
authorisation.  The counterparty system upload will occur within the next few 
days.  Any approvals/adjustments  received after this upload will require 
manual entries through the GUI by product control.

We understand that this has been a long process with many changes.  This 
matrix has been refined since the initial distribution to Tax, Credit and 
Legal on July 30, 1999.  I apologize for the tough task.

The goal now is to obtain sign off on this pre launch matrix ASAP: 

Credit should provide the limits for Section 2, review Sections 3 & 4 to 
ensure adherence to the Enron Credit Policy  and work closely with Legal and 
Global on providing a Master Agreement matrix

Tax should review the additions to the matrix to ensure that the profile does 
not breach any tax laws or create a tax exposure and work with Global resolve 
the issue of country of incorporation

Legal should fill in the matrix to ensure that there are no legal or 
regulatory impediments to trade and work closely with Legal and Global on 
providing a Master agreement matrix

I will be co-ordinating with Jeff Hodge (US Legal); Justin Boyd (UK Legal); 
Debbie Brackett (Global Credit); Janine Juggins (UK Tax); Connie Sutton 
(Global)  and Stephen Douglas (US Tax) tomorrow to see what it will take to 
finish this task off.  Please call me with any questions at X30397. 

Thank you for the work you have done to date and for all that is yet to be 
completed.

Bob

List looks good to me!

All the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to Awais and I 
have asked him to provide them to you.  I understand you have weather which 
was faxed.  

Mike,

You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos 
Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement 
Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me 
and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.  

Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can 
you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals 
(Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.

Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a 
document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new 
database created similar to ours?

Thanks for your help!

Brent,

I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.  If we don't get 
you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.

Hope you are doing well...we miss you!

I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our 
meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and 
haven't heard.

In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 
days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like 
to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any 
specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's 
the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that 
answered.

That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about 
the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade 
between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the 
proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language 
we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border 
trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company 
(Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through 
non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets 
with your approval.

Brent,

I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement 
database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use 
it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I 
spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have 
shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need 
to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working 
on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to 
developing a similar system for you.

I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most 
current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been 
gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has 
revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the 
reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David 
Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP 
issues.

We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to 
the back of the Industrial Master.  It is still located in my form directory, 
called industrial-u.s.#5.doc.

I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.  We really do 
have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a 
relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response.

It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the 
latest.  Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.  Can you 
email me the latest draft.  Thanks!

Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT 
Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working 
off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't 
show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure 
that we don't send them any mailouts.

Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.  I hope there was no 
frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...!

I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a 
counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).  It's at 
www.utilityconnection.com.  It even has non-U.S. utilities.  When you have a 
minute, give it a look.

Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for 
ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in 
place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to 
do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada 
has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks!

document from an editorial perspective.  The remaining changes are intended 
to correct inaccuracies in the documents.  I've spoken with Allan Aronowitz 
about the fact that it might be a good idea to include some general 
disclaimers relating to any projections or the like included in these 
descriptions and think that it would be an excellent idea to include such a 
disclaimer.  I have accordingly left in some forward-looking type projections 
that I might otherwise recommend revising or deleting altogether.  If you do 
not intend to include any general disclaimers, let me know so that I can 
further revise as necessary.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments 
relating to the attached.

Regards, 

Leslie Hansen

 

I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between 
Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. "signing" 
the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in 
this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 
of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with 
respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same 
language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better 
than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on 
the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.

All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or 
issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.

Let me know if I can be of further service...

Sent again.

It turns out that Jeff Hodge made plane reservations for 1:30 pm on 
Wednesday.  Can we move that meeting up to 11:00 am?

We have dinner reservations for Saturday at 7:30.  Reservation #189.

I will be able to attend.

Access to the online trading system?  If that's the questions, probably none 
of us.

There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading 
lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.

This project continues to be highly confidential.

For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can 
trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need 
your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with 
the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in 
English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty 
or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with 
utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying 
to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it 
sounds like a utility or governmental.

Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the 
counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?

Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the 
counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until 
due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of 
incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian 
law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we 
need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start 
looking at it.

Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us 
with no changes.  NOX and SOX are attached also.

Sign off on Canada.

Mark,

David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not 
so sure it's correct.  We think it should reflect two huge power price 
spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.  We don't

Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The 
counterparties are broken into three sections.  The first section contains 
counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you

and inserted next to similar product types.

Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty 
list.  I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's 
approved counterparty list here in Houston.

Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, 
state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the 
country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading 
will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy 
companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap 
trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information 
until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you 
cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies 
to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at 
individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.

The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in 
active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I 
know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.  
You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.

I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to 
go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about 
discussing any other financial issues we might have then...

I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at.  
You may want to get it from her.  It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there 
also.

Scott, one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of 
his friends and asked if we could take a look at it.  I gave it to Mark 
Taylor and since the fellow lives in England he thought it would be better 
sent to you.

Please respond to guptaa@ms.com
Hey John,

Thanks for the favour.  If you could put this in front of the right

New York or is all the legal work done out of Houston as well.

Hope the markets are treating you well.

Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.  It's got 
the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the 
agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without 
Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell 

I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and 
the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps 
Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to 
create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) 
both?

I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is 
an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the 
ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc.

Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.  I don't know how 
long mail takes to get there.  It will probably be there I hope in today's 
mail.

I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our 
Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes 
Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that 
can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our 
trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant 
General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent 
and Andrea access.

Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a 
database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about 
getting this new database created?

Thanks for your help!

John: Thanks for taking the time to read the email. I have not had many=20
responses!

There are two reasons why I drafted the clause in this way.=20

1) It tracks the "cure" modification clause for Credit Event Upon Merger (a=
nd=20
I think the cures for both clauses need to be consistent).

2) The wording is useful because it describes what the written demand is=20
asking for - i.e. "performance assurance".=20

Maybe there is a more elegant way of expressing #2 - maybe we just use "for=
"=20
rather than "therefor". I was not the original drafter of the CEUM provisio=
n=20
so I don't know why it was written this way but in any event, the concept o=

#2 needs to remain in clause in some fashion.=20

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ECT's NYMEX energy commodity futures trading.  These applications require 
that ECT represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a 
power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other related 
commodity future account(s) either individually or acting with another person 
pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please let me know by the end of business May 31, 1999 if you have any power 
of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures 
account (other than an ECT account).

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call me at (713) 
853-7459, or my paralegal, Tana Jones at (713) 853-3399.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS REQUEST.

Have you sent these to Steve Kean?

The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour 
until 2:30 pm.

If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking 
for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am 
currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information 
America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are 
you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well 
as others...!

We do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files.  Can you have 
one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees, 
credit support documents, etc.

Much thanks...

Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA 
incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel 
for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.  So, I'll work with 
Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal 
team for approval.

Shari,

The correct S&P rating is BBB- and as Pat mentioned, we DO want to include as 
part of the definition of Material Adverse Change if the counterparty ceases 
to be rated.  Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya-

I am sure that you noticed in the attachment that Shari has the trigger at 
BBB and not BBB-.  In addition, do we want to add language in that section 
that says an Event of Default also occurs if they are no longer rated by S&P?

Regards,

Pat

Further to our meeting this past Monday, attached please find a proposal for

Any comments or suggestions would be welcome. 

Many thanks,

Thanks for the material.  I've been really busy at work.  At some point when 
I have more of a break I'll call you.

Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English 
culture, the Morris Men.  I've got their website bookmarked.  Y'all are a 
goofy bunch.  Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with 
switches.  It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English 
culture to me.  I am constantly amused!  If y'all would only cheer at 
marathons...!

Shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those 
documents (Deemed ISDA, legal opinions, etc.) I distributed a while back?

That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to 
Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or 
laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.  
Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in 
effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you 
need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and 
we'll give them a call.

Here's that email....!

I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online 
trading.  Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with 
respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore 
be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are 
there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the 
governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not 
be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others?  
Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our 
agreements?  Any guidance you could give us with this would be most 
appreciated!

How are you and the baby doing?  We hope to see pictures on your next trip 
over!

Thank you for the lunch invite.  I put on the calendar..."lunch w/sweet

to have to mention...that you are the troublemaker!

Wonderful job!

Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on 
France and utility counterparties.  Any update?

What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the 
master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until 
we get a new certificate?

How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your 
cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The 
grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights 
of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit

Tana,

ECT Houston can engage in commodity/weather derivatives trades direct with 
French counterparties, without having to use EEFT as the UK regulated 
arranger.  Put another way, whatever ECTRI can do from a regulatory 
perspective, the same applies to ECT Houston.  Please refer to the completed 
list that Edmund sent.

As for engaging in derivatives trades with utilities, this does not give rise 
to the issues as under US laws.  [In respect of new counterparties, standard 
due diligence as to corporate authority, etc will need to be done].

Hope all's well!

Justin/Ed

The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements.

The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus 
causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is 
the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some 
time.

The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current 
fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to 
the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in 
reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains 
in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend 
crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?

We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch!

Thanks for getting back to me.  Would it be possible for our IT department to 
call you just before 11.00 a.m. (Central time) to get the call set up.  
Apparently, IT here call you and you put the call through to your video 
conference room.  I would ask Suzanne Adams who I have been dealing with to 
sort this out but I understand that she is going to be out of the office that

Any problems, please let me know.

The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements.

I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, 
everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who 
Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager, 
but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the 
Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good, 
or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very 
expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who 
at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.  Perhaps we should set 
up a meeting to talk to Phillipe Bibi about the Fishkin project, so we make 
sure we get a good person assigned to us.   What do you think?

You forgot to have me off the week of Thanksgiving too.  I know I mentioned 
that to you...

Per our conversation, the additional "to do" list is:

1.  plumber still needs to do his stuff
2.  put up new light fixture in back bedroom
3.  fix broken window in Peter & Nancy's front bedroom.  You'll need to call 
them to let them know the day you're doing it.

I'm out Tues. and Weds. at an in house seminar.  How does today or Thursday 
sound?

Thanks for taking a look!

When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".  As 
you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with 
their commodity business.  Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the 
"assignment".  Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?  I 
don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.  What 
should I do?

Per David Forster, they should be doing the online trading simulation 
tomorrow.

Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out 
they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades 
thereunder.  So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to 
have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.

So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board 
resolution prior to trading"

To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:

Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of 
counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.  As noted below, an 
additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.

FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this 
week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week.

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due 
to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and 
master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.

I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.  Do you need me to make 
you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their 
notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get 
copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth 
noting?

They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and 
ask Mark for a raise to match my title!

I thought of you this weekend.  It was the fall antique festival in Round Top 
and I went, but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day I had with you 
and your family.  That was such a perfect day all around and I will treasure 
it.  I hope all is going well....

So I don't forget for Monday, Shari just send around the Canadian "eligible 
swap participant" language to be inserted in all Canadian confirms.  Don't we 
also need to add that to the Canadian online GTC's?

At Mark's request, I am transmitting proposed changes to the collateral=20
arrangement language in the Online GTC's.  Please let me know if it meets=
=20
with your approval.

8.  Collateral Arrangements.  Counterparty shall (at Enron=01,s request) fr=

Yes, the list is the final approved counterparty list before the roll out of 
the system.  All counterparty lists are due by the close of business 
tomorrow.  If you are not sure of what the current approved counterparty 
lists are let me know.

That's ok.  Our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade.

Do not worry about that new product type.  It doesn't pertain to you.  If you 
see none that looks like power you might want to pay attention.  I know Jeff 
has been getting similar emails.

The document wasn't in the blue file either.  I called Tanya and asked her if 
she could fax us up a copy of it.  Also, I asked her to let you know what her 
thoughts were on the proposed amendment.  Do you want me to call Rick at BMO 
and let him know you're working on it?

Just a confirmation, we have the following lawyers scheduled to attend the 
upcoming conference:   you, Justin, Paul and Jon.  Is that correct?

Lovely note, crummy master.  It makes Belco look good!  I know Olin 
Corporation only because they had a plant near the summer camp I went to in 
North Carolina and there were days when the stench from the plant pervaded 
the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains where the camp was located.  That plant 
manufactured the plastic wrap that went around all those cigarettes they were 
making in North Carolina.  I kinda remember them being a plastics company 
back then.

Attached is the latest draft of the referenced GTC.

Does this mean that we have 10 utilities that are approved to trade?  What 
are we doing with the other 30-40?
We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with 
masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently 
being negotiated.  The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we 
get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto 
(like legal opinions).  

Just an FYI

About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the 
referenced counterparty.  She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a 
call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and 
Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave 
him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to 
treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals 
before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get 
the trade, we're not surprised.

We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers 
still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing 
problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail 
several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the 
brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will 
you be able to get this notice our of our name change?

I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, 
but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they 
can't file that form until they receive the notice from us.

How can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email?

To All

As we near completion of the master review for required collateral provisions 
for counterparts to trade OnLine, please find attached a consolidated list of 
exceptions.  This list highlights those counterparts where EOL should utilize 
GTCs with collateral in lieu of executed masters.  Summary findings are as 
follows:

1) Gas - reject master and use GTC w/collateral for 20 clients

2) Power - Reject 2 counterparts from trading OnLine

3) Financial - No exceptions

4) Canada - TBD

5) London - No exceptions

Thanks to everyone who assisted with this important review of credit 
provisions.   Please feel free to forward this note as necessary or contact 
me for any questions.

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
"not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

Attached are the revised online GTC's.  The weather GTC's won't change except 
for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same 
change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's.

Did we order that special UK sized paper?  I still have to copy that OMLX 
stuff for Mark Elliott's binder there in London.

Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his 
subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one 
of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house.  
I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box 
they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you 
cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a 
wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.

Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out 
the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing 
any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good 
businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a 
job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the 
cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a 
lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his 
additional time or money on.  

To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you 
pay.

Rod,

Nella sent me a Compliance Certificate and financial statements for the 
referenced counterparty.  I am forwarding them down to you.

I don't have anything specific to weather, I have material from recent 
general seminars I've worked on for Mark T. and Mark H. if you need it.  I do 
have general articles on weather...

I'm glad to see they have the "A Team" as a speaker.  You're marvelous!

The 1st list attached here is the one I used for the 1st list you have.

Debbie/Tom,

Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The 
counterparties are broken into three sections.  The first section contains 
counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you 
have previously reviewed.  These new product types are highlighted in yellow 
and inserted next to similar product types.

Please call me with any questions/comments.

What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?  Brant says we're in a strong 
negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's 
book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to 
take in those Howard trades.  He wants to know if he should use our leverage 
here to get that ISDA Master in place.

Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!

Just a note, if you've got some recent pictures of your daughter to bring 
them...

Anita sent me the message below re: board resolutions to trade out of

Hi Tana

We have entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd.    
As we need to put in place a proper resolution, could you please let us know 
whether you have any standard board resolution template so that we may also 
use it to pass the necessary board resolution?

Thanks
Angeline

Per our discussion...

I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
usually do?

Edmund,

Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first 
ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't 
know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, 
ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, 
Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who 
could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you 
are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for 
the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in 
Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's 
signature.

Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for 
signature, as also will your London Credit person.

Congrat Anita!  This is very exciting!
Anita Fam
10/19/99 09:01 PM
Hi Tana,

Thanks for your note ....which was totally helpful as usual.

This is the FIRST ISDA that we're executing here in Singapore so it's a Red 
Letter Day for us.  The process has been painfully slow mainly because of 
London Credit's reluctance to provide us with any credit terms unless the 
situation really demands for it.  We've got another one in the pipeline with 
one of the Shell affiliates though I'm not exactly holding my breath about 
it.  We'd sent them the draft last year and they've yet to revert despite us 
sending frequent reminders.  Not exactly on the top of their  list of things 
to do obviously!!!

Anyway - Caltex has executed the ISDA which we have in hand and what I would 
like to know is who is on the slate of signatories for ECTRIC.  Is there 
anyone in the London office who is authorised to sign the document otherwise 
we'll have ISDA couriered over to you in Houston.  If the document is to be 
executed in Houston, I'd be eternally  grateful if you could assist in 
getting the ISDA executed for us on ECTRIC's behalf as well as in obtaining 
the Secretary's signature for both certificates. I'll have my assistant 
Angeline coordinate with you on  the nitty gritties so that you'll know when 
to expect to receive the documents for execution.

Many thanks as always,
Anita

No, I haven't met Matt, in fact, I don't know much about him.  Is he here 
now?  For how long?  Thru the Legal Conference?  I would be happy to help in 
whatever way I can.  As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this 
would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.

I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.  You have been wonderful to 
work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.  Your baby's gain 
in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our 
company.  I hope our lives will cross again some time!  Best wishes for your

Mark, should we forward Carol's email to Bill, so he knows what the issues 
are?

Can we get a very quick legal approval of this please.  I would be most

With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: 
insurance/reinsurance company issues.

Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all 
insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.  The online 
people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading 
with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.  They are wanting 
to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins. we are 
currently trading with without a master in place.   Do you have a list of 
those companies?   What are your feelings about that?  Can we trade online 
with Swiss Re?  How about any other insurance companies you are currently 
trading with without a master in place?  Or do you want me continue to say no?

Thanks for your help! 

The Icon worked and I've pulled it up and can use it.  Thanks for your help!

How's things going there?  Are you getting excited about going back home?  
Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you?  Everything 
cool on the roommate front?

I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable!  What a cutie!  I've 
bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates.  

I'd like to attend!

Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to 
outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the 
online trading issues.  We have to get similar letters out to some of the 
South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.

Much thanks!  By the way, weren't you out for vacation?  Did you have a good 
time?

Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of 
our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.  I have some minor 
clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from 
Christian Yoder in our Portland office.  As soon as I receive Christian's 
comments I will add forward them on to you.

It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark 
for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican 
counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, 
did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of 
online transactions?

	
	

Tana,

I have faxed to your attention some more issues with Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
documents.  Toky-Mitsubishi has sent a fax requesting a few things be added 
to our Confirmation.  The fact that the Master Agreement does not cover 
Commodity trades is not one of their problems (see below).  However, there 
are some Master related issues that they wish to have included in the 
Confirmation such as Market Disruption Events, Disruption Fallbacks, and a 
Non-Reliance provision.  As well as a couple of changes to our standard 
language ('first nearby month' rather than 'prompt month').

Let us know what you think of their comments.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Joe -

The Master Agreement with TM does not contemplate entering into Commodity 
Transactions. Confirms with this CP will require special language to be 
provided by Legal. Please make a note in Special Handling and contact Legal 
if any further trades comes down. Once we have the language, we will need to 
revise the Confirmation for the trade done 10/15, and Bob will need to create 
a special template for TM.

Dale

I have forwarded on your email and fax to Marie Heard.  She was already 
working on that issue, what a happy coincedence!

When are you coming in?  When shall we have dinner?

Below are my responses to your email:

1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation 
in the master only:   per our conversation.
2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price 
swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in 
the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot 
trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy.
3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the 
due diligence on this country at this time.
4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1
5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below.
6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to 
the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack 
of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency 
transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open 
them for trading any commodity.
7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above.
8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy 
commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest 
rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we 
could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a 
fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi.
9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have 
agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master.
10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with 
them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other 
trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from 
their Board of Directors.  So they are still "no" for online derivatives 
trading.
11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance 
companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have 
special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not 
address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master 
in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation & 
bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval 
for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds 
of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type 
of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say "no" to online trading 
based on these special handling procedures.
12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say "yes" to online derivatives trading, 
however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have 
a master in place with.
13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above.
14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status.
15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above.
16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for 
this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided 
to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless 
their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed 
above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from 
Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password 
Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these 
special signatory requirements.
17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above.
18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.

Critical Changes to my list:

1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to 
request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in 
Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a 
master in place.
2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master 
appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this 
resolved, we are switching them to a "no".

Per my meeting today with Credit:

I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility 
or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will 
get back to you.

My Review of Your List:

List #1

1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from 
your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with.  
ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT 
Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to 
energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5
2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and 
trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to 
do with these situations when we have more than one master in place.
3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping 
issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S. 
Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, "bought their 
book".  We actually couldn't "buy their book" because of our low credit 
rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all 
payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity 
business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap 
(not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were 
to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to 
the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any, 
trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and 
find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue.
4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty.  
Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the 
master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of 
the Credit override.
5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power 
Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2) 
Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a 
utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place, 
approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master, 
would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place, 
approved for all trading.

List #2

1.  Cabot Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Callon Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  EIL Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
4.  Fortune Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Plains Resources:  Missed "X" on all weather
6.  PXRE Corp:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only
7.  St. Mary Land & Exploration:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
8.  Stratum Group:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
9.  Tempest Reinsurance:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather 
deals only
10.  Twister Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
11.  United Salt:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
12.  West Texas Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather

List #3

1.  Bargo Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Belco Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  Cross Timbers:  Missed "X" on all weather
4.  Encore Acquisition:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Norfolk Southern:  You've got them restricted for everything, I've got 
them as "OK" for everything
6.  RMS Monte Christo:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
7.  Sapient Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather

In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!

We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
advice?

Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different 
product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.  The two issues out of the 
meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were:

1.  Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.  Per our 
discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all 
outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus.  
There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore 
was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going 
to do.  Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts.
2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our 
discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the 
approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a "B" approved 
GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the 
credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was 
still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to 
him.  I guess the physical people are OK with that.  I don't know what 
discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want 
to have this confirmed for him.

Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be 
some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.  Who will be 
drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups?

Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to 
trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the 
updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday.
Alan Aronowitz

I believe we did the initial survey in 1996-97 in Mexico (Sara and I worked 
on it together), cobering financial and physical trading. I don't know if 
there have been any updates since that time. You should check with Steve Van 
Hooser, Sara Shackleton and Peggy Banczak. I do not have any issues to add to 
the original survey.

FYI, we are also going to send out a memo to Columbian counsel requesting 
advice on online trading and asking them for any other general update to 
their earlier advice.

Below is a confirm issue for handling.

Chris, in the future, please direct your confirmation requests to Susan 
Bailey, who is the current paralegal on the confirm rotation, or if the 
request is for an Annex B, to each of Susan Bailey, Susan Flynn and Marie

Tana,

Two options were done with Tokyo Mitsubishi on October 22.  The terms are:  
ENA sells a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $23 with a $0.46 
premium;  ENA buys a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $24 with a 
$0.20 premium.  I understand that special language is being prepared for a 
trade done on October 15, and believe that the same language will need to 
apply on these options.  Please contact me should you need further 
information.

Thanks,

Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's 
legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have 
already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from 
Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do?

Shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we 
asked for the update from them.

Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power 
deal with Duke.  You might want to get in touch with Federico.

Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of 
Argentina.
Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
05/18/99 04:12 PM
Federico Cerisoli is in discussions with Duke's Argentina office about doing 
a power swap.  Why they need a waiver for this I can not guess since the deal 
will still be between a Duke entity and ECT(since EI does not have a swap 
entity yet).  Is the confidentiality provision so narrow that they cannot 
show the master to affiliates?  Do they want to show it to a non-affiliated 
entity?  Any questions on the structure of the proposed deal can be forwarded 
to Federico.  Let me know if this helps.

Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!

Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out.

Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob 
Bowen needed you to sign off on.  He says he never hear back.  Can you call 
him and give him the sign off.  Thanks!

Can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading 
with the following counterparties:

Florida Power & Light
Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company
Dakota Gasification Company
Hydro-Quebec
Enmax Corp.

Much thanks!

Bob, there are a few others I am still re-reviewing, I will get back to you 
as soon as I resolve/answer my questions.

How did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for Elf Trading S.A. 
(ECT & ECt Int'l)?

Another counterparty change, for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited 
Partnership.  We will switch that to a "yes" but only if they accept online 
GTC w/o change.  This is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for 
the partners, and that is totally unacceptable.

I discovered it was a non-ISDA master, so I had to delete the weather.

I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all 
financial trading.  She has also been discussing the utilities with outside 
counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.  She is going to 
bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully 
we'll have some more changes for you next week.

The following is reported today in one of the daily bankruptcy news services I
receive. I thought you might be interested in keeping up with Forcenergy's
bankruptcy case which appears to be headed toward confirmation with more than 
a
few hiccups along the way.

Forcenergy Wins Court OK Of Plan Disclosure Statement
Forcenergy Inc. on Oct. 22 won
bankruptcy court approval of the disclosure statement
related to its plan of reorganization.
Doug Walter of Andrews & Kurth, counsel to the
oil & gas producer, said that Judge Thomas M. Brahney III
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Orleans said he
would approve the disclosure statement after numerous
objections were resolved prior to last Friday?s hearing.
A final order has not been signed, but Judge
Brahney indicated his intent to sign the order at the hearing,
Walter added.
Walter said that Forcenergy hopes to begin
soliciting votes on the reorganization plan on Nov. 3.
Solicitation materials are currently being drafted.
Judge Brahney has scheduled a plan confirmation
hearing for Dec. 13.
As reported, the disclosure statement was amended
after the creditors? committee, while supporting the plan,
found the disclosure statement to be lacking information in
a number of areas. The document was amended to clarify
a few of the secured claims that will be paid in full in cash,
rather than over time.
The creditors noted that the plan proposes a
distribution to equity shareholders in an amount close to
50% of the current value of their interests, while unsecured
creditors will only receive close to 60% of the value of their
claims.
Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations Inc., Baker
Petrolite Corp. and Western Atlas International Inc. had
asserted in a Sept. 15 objection that the plan violated the
absolute priority rule and was thus not confirmable.
The Baker Hughes group also took issue with the
plan for lumping all lien creditors into one class. "The
Proposed Plan wholly fails to address the issue that the
various lien creditors have liens against properties which
may vary greatly in value," the Baker Hughes group said.
It added that the plan is thus not confirmable as the secured
claimants are not properly classified into separate classes
According to Walter, the disclosure statement was
revised to allow for four different treatments of around $34
million in miscellaneous secured claims.
Liens designated sub-class A, claims senior to
other secured claims, will be paid out in full in cash. Sub-class
B liens, those outside Louisiana, will be asked to
accept 85 cents on the dollar for their claims. Sub-class C
liens, those that attach in Louisiana, will be asked to accept
80 cents on the dollar for their claims. And, finally, all
other liens, those in sub-class D, may be challenged.
If sub-class D liens are found to be legitimate, they
will be paid in cash in full over time, or their collateral will
be returned to them. However, Forcenergy says it will not
return any collateral constituting a mineral lease.
As reported, Forcenergy?s plan of reorganization
is expected to provide holders of allowed general unsecured
claims with a 62% recovery through the distribution of
23.04 million shares of new common stock on a pro rata
basis.
On Sept. 22 the hearing on the adequacy of the
disclosure statement began. It was then continued until
Oct. 15, and then again to Oct. 22, in order to give the
company time to supplement the document and address the
objections.   --end--

To remind me to discuss this with you when you get in:

We received via our fax notices from the OMLX a request to provide them with 
information about our Y2K readiness.  When you have a minute let's look at 
the form together.  Probably Alan will have the answers.

Pat,

This waiver has to deal with a provision in the ECT master swap agreement 
that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential, 
except to certain people like auditors.  It did not allow the agreement to be 
provided to affiliates.  Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement 
in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that 
is doing the deal down in Argentina.  Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke 
Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's 
permission to give them a copy of the agreement.  That it what I am trying to 
resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give 
Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.

Your issue, obviously, is what business Federico is doing.  My issue is more 
of a documentation/legal issue.

I stopped by to see you because Mark got in the mail a blacklined draft of 
the prospectus from Bowne on the weather offering and I wanted to see if you 
got your own copy or do you need me to have one made for you.

Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project 
I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor 
was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of 
work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.  

You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based 
commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.  Mark has 
been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of 
work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have 
been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, 
which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether 
we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has 
meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and 
trading restrictions.

As far as my "Fishkin" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an 
internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, 
objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking 
at, some we found out Enron already has.    Mark and I are discussing what 
we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our 
thoughts soon.

 Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a 
Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design 
the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA 
opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have 
been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as 
well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put 
this database together and start loading the information.

So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!

P.S.  Thanks for the article!

Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the 
Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.  If you are using that form at 
all you should update it to include our changes.  I think Paul mentioned in 
his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the 
basis form for Norway.  Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at 
that form.

See, you're always in my thoughts!  Missed you at the seminar.  I hope we'll 
see you at one of these soon!

I hear you had dinner with our friend Molly Saturday night, what happened to 
the relatives?!

When you have a minute, PECO called with an authorized trader list problem 
and Liz asked me to bring it to you for handling...

Angeline

Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark 
Frevert?  I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate 
before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.  How do you plan on 
doing this?  Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the 
signing.  What are your thoughts?

I will send a copy to you!  We miss you...

I called Edmund Cooper and he is out on vacation til Monday.   Do you think I 
should email him the certificate, have him print it out there in London, I 
guess Anita has to initial the two ISDA Master Agreements for signature, then 
Edmund could get them initialled by  Credit in London, and then bring the 
certificates and agreements up to Mark Frevert for signature.  What do you 
think?

If you've got the copies, why don't you save them as a form into your system 
and use them to draft the Caltex Certificates.  Send them over to Edmund with 
the ISDA Master Agreements.  Leave him a message asking him if he could help 
you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed, then have him 
send the certificates to me for Kate's signature.  I think that should do it.

Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we 
veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if 
Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that 
Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same 
understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to 
your email I have the following comments:

1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.  
Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific 
officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot 
trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.  
All their  trades must be done by telephone.
2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities 
such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!
3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the 
transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT 
and Aspect.
4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial 
trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, 
either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they 
provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading 
in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master 
agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.
5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have 
informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In 
reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we 
probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the 
master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.
6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we 
resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do 
have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin 
trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master.

I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.  The presentation 
was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it 
could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and 
swap agreement form templates.  I need to talk to our confirm desk people to 
see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were 
hoping this system could address.   They had one concept for form generation 
I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.  The 
concept was this "data dictionary".  It made it all clear to me.

I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked 
them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come 
back to us before I leave for Europe in June.

I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all 
financial trading.  She has also been discussing the utilities with outside 
counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.  She is going to 
bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully 
we'll have some more changes for you next week.

I discovered it was a non-ISDA master, so I had to delete the weather.

Per my meetings with Credit and further research, I am making the following 
changes to the financial counterparty approval list.  Credit/Mark, let me 
know if you disagree with any of my changes.

Bob, there are a few others I am still re-reviewing, I will get back to you 
as soon as I resolve/answer my questions.

Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.

Per my conversations with Credit, the referenced counterparty is the New 
Jersey incorporated sub of a German company, a liquids based counterparty, 
and they are an eligible swap participant.  We do not have a master agreement 
in place with them.  I am approving them for all financial trading.

Per Peter's request...

Tana:

Attached is a credit worksheet for Enertek that requires them to post an L/C 
in the amount of $50,000.  I assume that we will be confirming the deal under 
a deemed ISDA since the Master is not executed yet.  The deal was just done 
today by Jennifer Fraser.

Please call me if I am not clear on the worksheet.

Regards,

Pat

Attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's.

I have received the Unanimous Written Consent of the Board of Directors of 
When signing the Password Applications, Dale and Bob should sign them as 
"Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".  In the absence of Dale or Bob, any V.P. or 
above can sign Password Applications (with initials from Legal).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion.

It appears Susan Bailey still can not get in and edit the master swap 
agreement database.  She now has the icon, but no edit priviliges.  Can you 
please get her access.  Much thanks!

Can you forward to Karen a copy of the lastest Electronic Trading Agreement.  
I'm not comfortable that what I have is the latest.  Much thanks!

In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that 
repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap 
Agreement Database.

Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any 
ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the 
information.  This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, 
Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.  The only information we need to continue 
to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client 
privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited 
to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and 
Credit have access to the Portland General masters.

Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading 
issues.  Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to 
have this information and access available by that time.

In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.

Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the 
changes.  Thanks for your help!

Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion.

How about Wednesday at 10:00 am?

Please find attached Annex B.doc.

Barry Tycholiz has asked me to confirm for you that we do have a master in 
place with Husky.  We do, indeed, and I will shoot a copy down to you.

I faxed over some changes Thursday.  I deleted all references to ECT and ECT 
Legal Advisors being a party to the opinion.  Haedicke is an officer of ECT 
International, he is General Counsel and Managing Director, and so he can 
sign as such.  No need to pull ECT into the opinion when unnecessary.

Mark wanted me to let you know he is reviewing your legal opinion and will 
call you with his comments.

What is this email about?  Do I need to do anything?  Also, your attachment 
is unreadable because the columns are overlapping.

I was told this was supposed to be an Omnibus, not a Deemed ISDA.

Attached is Annex B.  Just tell them they need to fill in blanks in guaranty.

I checked our records and we do not have any Master Swap Agreement with 
either K&N Marketing or Kinder Morgan.  Perhaps Credit knows something about 
this.  In addition, we cannot approve any merger documents until we get 
copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant Secretary of State.  
Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us.

Pam,

Per the email below, we will be terminating the transactions referenced below 
today.  Can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #1 below so I can make 
sure I have referenced them correctly.  Much thanks!

Sent by: Nella Cappelletto
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Further to our conference call this evening, I confirm that Lavorato is quite 
keen to have the paper ready tomorrow for the termination of the BMO 
transactions to free up BMO credit availability with ECC and ECC's 
affiliates, which I can attend to.  

Before doing so, as I have had limited involvement to this point, I would 
appreciate if we could have a brief conference call respecting the 
documentation.  I understand the documentation should reflect the following:

1. termination by ENA of BMO transactions under ENA/BMO ISDA Master 
Agreement, transactions nos. N28388, N28977, N31021, N30817 and N32670;
2. termination payment from ENA to BMO of approximately Cdn. $10 million (to 
be confirmed);
3. termination payment is made by ENA on behalf of ECC (on what basis is to 
be confirmed, as transaction are between ENA and BMO); and
4. ECC repays ENA the termination payment pursuant to an inter-company 
transaction (on what basis is to be confirmed).

Regards, Peter

Attached is the proposed form of Termination Agreement.   I have requested 
copies of the relevant confirmations from the Confirm Desk to confirm that 
the transactions are referenced correctly.  Please let me know if you have 
any comments. 

Mark Taylor asked if we could make one additional change to the database.   
He wants to move the "Restrictions" right after the counterparty name so it's 
the first thing the dealmakers see when the open an entry.

Thanks, we really appreciate your help!

Please find attached form of Deemed ISDA.  When you fax it to the 
counterparty can you please attach to the back of the fax  IRS Forms 1001 and 
W-8.  Much thanks!

Mark asked if you could add something else.  Could you add an additonal drop 
down that follows "Legal Contacts that says "Historical Contacts".  We 
wouldn't want anyone else to see that but Legal and Credit.  Thanks!

Peter,

Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.  
Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we 
have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!

I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok 
there.  

I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving 
holidays.  If you need to get hold of me my assistant will have my cell phone 
number (since it's NYMEX bid week and both Mark and I will be out, I have to 
be reachable.  Mark will have an international cell phone with him, he's 
sailing in the Caribbean, so if you need to get hold of him for any reason, 
Taffy will have the number).

Let me know if I can be of further help today!

If you need to get hold of us next week, Mark and my cell phone numbers are 
as follows:

Mark:  011 44 7881 512 535 (dial like you were calling London)
Tana:  (713) 206-8080

We seem to be getting alot of questions about the name changes of the various 
Enserch/TXU entities, so attached  is a comprehensive list.  A copy of the 
notice will be sent to the usual suspects.

Thank you.

Thanks for the article.  I will distribute it to our group and Credit.  With 
Online Trading quieting down a bit, Mark and I are finally focusing on 
"Project Fishkin" (as we call it).  I am already getting a new database 
developed, the jurisdictional database, to keep track of swap laws around the 
world.  We hope to finalize our recommendations soon, and get the project up 
to Haedicke for his approval.

Of course, Online trading goes live today to our customers, so there's not 
telling what problems may crop up.  I'm crossing my fingers for a quiet day!

Hope your holidays went well.  My mom came down from New York, and it was 
colder in Houston than it was at home!

If you have a complete list regarding the Enserch entities we wish to trade 
with, I can run it by Enserch and check on the legal names.  I think it would 
be helpful for our full distribution (Legal, Confirm and Others (settlements, 
Global Contracts, misc), if you would distribute a full list of the Enserch 
entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each 
entity.  I think this will stop people coming back and asking again and 
again.

Frank,

Mark asked me to handle this.  Can you forward to me the name and phone 
number of the person that signed the password application?  Thanks.

Mark,

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Frank

Peter,

I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement.  It is an ISDA Master Agreement 
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of June 28, 1995.  The Agreement was 
executed between ECT and Banque Paribas.  Banque Paribas changed its name to 
"Paribas" on May 11, 1998, so I think you need to change the agreement  and 
signature line to read "Paribas, formerly known as Banque Paribas". or 
something to that effect.  The agreement is governed by New York law.

Pam,

Peter Keohane, our Calgary attorney, is working on a termination of some 
trades between ECT and Paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following 
confirmations ASAP, Deal nos. EA7484.3 and EB3772.3.  

Thanks yet again!

From what we have been able to determine, it appears that the City of 
Riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives.

I sent the UBS Letter to the confirm desk like a week ago, I forget who to, 
maybe  Bernice, since I kinda consider it an audit letter.  My note said the 
confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to 
confirm trade information.

The Teeside Confirm, I spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they 
were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it...I'll call 
them again.

Thanks for the update!

Joe,

I just found out Pam is out today and Peter needs these confirms ASAP.  Can 
you get them to him.  Thanks.

Thanks for your prompt help with this!  I know Peter appreciates it.

I asked  Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he 
didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.   I think in his job in Fuel 
and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.  He probably 
makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.  He also 
wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.  I spoke to Liz Sager and 
she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority 
issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.

As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.  I spoke 
to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, 
they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address 
and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.  Of course, the only groups 
that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for 
confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.

But we are going to open everything but the comments and "priority" screens 
to any interested business people.  I'm going to move the "restrictions" bar 
right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they 
will see will be any restrictions.

Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and 
then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have 
some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and 
can't remember things!).

I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we 
would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with 
them.  I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical 
power trade with them.  Of course, we can still not do financial trading 
until we run through all the hoops with them.  I don't know who you directed 
your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading 
and I said we would send him a packet.

We have resolved the authority issue with referenced counterparty, and have 
approved all financial trading, including online financial trading, under the 
executed ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and this counterparty dated June 
23, 1999.

In response to your email re:  Richardson Products II, this counterparty was 
approved for trading (without a master then in place) under my initial list 
of approved counterparties.  Per the email below, we then received in the 
signed master and the distribution was notified.

Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.

Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.  When 
I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a 
different path.

Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus 
Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and 
once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I 
am adding drop downs for "approved for online trading", so you will be able 
to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently 
provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think 
other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, 
Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for 
confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in 
terms of the financial contacts.

I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll 
have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I 
hope this is helpful!

In response to your email, an amendment to the referenced executed ISDA 
Master was sent by Susan Bailey to the Counterparty on 11/23/99.  With 
respect to the credit, this amendment provides for an increase in the 
Counterparty Exposure Threshold from U.S. $3,000,000 to U.S. $5,000,000, and 
amends one of the MAC provisions for Counterparty by increasing 
Counterparty's Net Worth from CAD$85,000,000 to CAD$150,000,000.  Certain 
other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the 
the LC provisions, as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate 
our recent form changes.  THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED.

Other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 3rd party debt 
default for Counterparty of CAD$5,000,000 and U.S. $50,000,000 with respect 
to Enron Corp., an Exposure Threshold for ECT Canada of $10,000,000, and a 
MAC for ECT Canada tied to a drop in Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating below "BBB-" 
from S&P.  The other MAC for Counterparty that is not being changed is if 
Counterparty's ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 1 to 1.

I hope that helps...let me know if you need more info or if you need me to 
fax these documents to you.

1.  Vitol S.A., Inc. - already approved for financial trading this morning, 
master in place.
2.  Nicor Enerchange-approved for financial trading, no master in place.
3.  Helmerich & Payme Energy Services, Inc.-approved for financial trading, 
no master in place.
4.  Ashland Speciality Chemical Company-is a division of Ashland, Inc.  
Ashland, Inc. is approved for financial trading, no master in place.  CONFIRM 
DESK:  WHEN THESE CONFIRMS GO OUT, we consider this counterparty to be 
Ashland, Inc.  We want Ashland, Inc. to show up as the company name and on 
the signature line.  If the counterparty wants the division name there, we 
can sign it "Ashland, Inc., acting through its Ashland Speciality Chemical 
Company division", but we want the company name there and on the hook.

Let me know if you have any questions...

I still do not appear to be getting copies of all credit worksheets.  Please 
remember to keep me on this distribution.

Just a note to remind you about something we need to discuss tomorrow, 
Transco Zone 6.

Why don't you send them directly to Kate, with a note to return them to you.  
It might speed things up.

Aquila wants to trade online under two names, Aquila Risk Management and 
Aquila Energy Marketing.  They have asked us to attach to their ETA, a 
listing, and copies, of all master agreements we have in place with those two 
counterparties, whether physical, financial, gas, power, etc.  Can you look 
those up for us and copy the relevant contracts?

Thanks for your help!

Molly,

Why were the counterparties on your latest list under the Legal tab different 
from those under the Credit tab?

The counterparties below for review are under the Credit approval tab.  
Please let me know ASAP if they are approved to trade.
Molly Harris
12/06/99 04:14 PM
Please find attached Credit's EOL responses for today.

Regards
Molly

Attached is another list for approval.  Under the comments section, if it 
says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved 
the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a 
division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty 
name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved 
to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing.
Molly Harris

Please find our approvals from last week consolidated on the attached file.  
This should be helpful in reviewing the activity.

 

Regards
Molly

So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan?

If you open in "view" you will be able to see it.  Thanks for your prompt 
response!

You get a gold star for the week!

That seems reasonable to me!  Ask the Swap Paralegals, no matter what the 
problem is, my answer is "well, you know what that means..." and they all 
respond "we can go home!".  If they only made me boss...

In connection with Enron Online, please add the following people to your 
email distribution list for new contracts or any contract or counterparty 
change:  Karen Lambert, Frank Davis, and Carrie Southard.

Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Obviously, we need to still input the trades.

Peter,

It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC 
meetings on Thursday.  I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this 
because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be 
in.

I forget my attachments all the time.  Sorry!

Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 
12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be 
ignored.  If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to 
look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of 
today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division  
The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going 
forward basis.

Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU 
IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE 
PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect 
counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the 
counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I 
ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.

Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which 
contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, 
in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.

Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will 
forward them to you as soon as I receive them.
Molly Harris
12/07/99 05:33 PM
To All

Please find attached a summary of Credit approvals for last week for EOL.  It 
is password protected and can be opened as "read only".

Regards
Molly

What is was is that the document was in Word 95 and we work in Word 97, so I 
just had to go in and open Word 95.  I think what you are doing is what they 
are trying to get up and going here in Houston, but they're not ready yet.  
Mine and Mark's questions to you is who goes down the Legal List and says yes 
or no to trading?

Attached are the final lists for this week for your approval.  Again, if I do 
not hear from the respective physical trading groups in 1 day I will assume 
that all counterparties are approved.
Molly Harris
12/08/99 02:43 PM
As requested, please find attached revised approval forms for Credit for 12/6 
and 12/7.  "read only" has been removed.

Thank you
Molly

Just a note to Group after discussion w/paralegals and Mark:  on a going 
forward basis if our counterparty is a hedge fund, we will ask for all 
corporate documents, plus a copy of their prospectus (which should show us 
what the fund is allowed to invest in).

Shawna and I are both sitting here so excited to get your note.  Are we 
available?  For Chapman?  Of course!!!  Shawna's answer is...both nights, 
many festive drinks!  We are only limited by the thought of choosing just one 
night over the other!  If we have to, we will.  We leave the choice to you, 
because we are available either night...  

	Jon Chapman

Guess where I am on Tuesday and Wednesday next week - any chance of getting 
together for a festive drink or even a festive coffee ???

Yours in eager anticipation

Just one note.  I have a typo in your company name in the address, it needs 
an "r".  Fax it back to me at 713/646-3490 and I will get it signed by

At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any
comments or questions.

(See attached file: excambria.doc)

Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for 
sending out NDA's.  When you need an NDA, please email me the following 
information.  I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our 
NDA's to check for conflicts.  Once we've done that I will prepare and send 
out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the 
particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.  Once it is fully 
executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the 
central gatekeeper of all NDA's.  

My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

My understanding of this NDA is that London gave it directly to Craig Chaney 
to get executed by the counterparty.  So, David, I think you need to get a 
copy from Craig, and then forward a copy on to me.

How did it get to be that these people are drafting their own NDA's.  I 
thought our agreement when we met with Dovie Keptra was that I would draft 
them.  I would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've 
changed.

Tanya,

Thanks for the info.  I'll amend the P&G status to include physical only 
until we hear something that makes us more comfortable trading financially.

Walter

We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
ISDA to confirm trades under.

Thanks,
Tanya

Susan Vrazel has left the building : )  Actually, Susan has decided to pursue 
other avenues; her last day was 
Tuesday, 5/18/99. Global CounterParty (GCP) requests will be handled by

Have a wonderful and productive day.

So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan?

Are you approving this for financial trading?  Per our conversations last 
week, I thought it would not meet the eligible swap participant criteria.  
Let me know....

Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to 
the following people:

Anita Fam
Brenda Whitehead
Elizabeth Sager
Jason Peters
Stephanie Sever
Christian Yoder
Lorraine Filomeno
Shari Stack
Susan Flynn
Lisa Lees

Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit 
Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom 
Moran and Veronica Espinoza.

Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit 
access:  Cheryl Nelson.

Thanks!

Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho 
Credit didn't have them marked as such.  Kimball, I am ok with the change 
adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, 
and no change there.  Bay State was previously shut down for financial and 
power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.  The Energy Authority, I 
had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.  Now, per Leslie, 
have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.

Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I 
am shutting them down for all financial.

TO:     All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms
FROM:  Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President
RE:        CFTC Approval and Exchange Implementation of Further Amendments 
to   Natural Gas Price Limits for Last Three Trading Days of Spot Month
DATE:   December 20, 2000

Notice #  00-431
==========================================================

Please be advised that the Exchange has received CFTC approval for further 
amendments to natural gas price limits.  Members were previously advised in 
Notice # 429 (December 18, 2000) that these changes were pending CFTC 
approval.

These changes will become effective as of the start of the RTH session on 
Friday, December 22, 2000. A copy of amended NYMEX Rule 220.08A (SPECIAL 
PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES) is included below in this 
Notice. The amendments to this rule add a new Section (E), which concerns the 
last three days of trading in the spot month; the amendments also make 
related conforming changes.

In view of the recent price movement in the Natural Gas contract, the 
Exchange is amending the applicable price limit rules as follows:

(1) There shall be no price limits for any Natural Gas futures contract month 
during the RTH session on the last three trading days of the current delivery 
month, i.e., spot month.

(2) By comparison, price fluctuation limits shall remain in effect for all 
contract months for the NYMEX ACCESS(r) sessions conducted on these three 
trading days as provided by Exchange rules and as further modified by 
applicable resolutions.

Thus, on Friday, December 22, on Tuesday, December 26, and on Wednesday, 
December 27, 2000, there shall be no price limits in effect for any Natural 
Gas futures contract months during the entire RTH session on those trade 
dates.

In other words, prices shall move on an unrestricted basis during the entire 
floor trading session on those three trade dates, and there shall be no 
trading halts triggered at any time during such sessions.

As a reminder, an Executive Committee Resolution is still in effect that 
amends on a temporary basis existing price limit rules by expanding the price 
limits on NYMEX ACCESS (for all contracts listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS 
that have price limits). The Resolution will remain in effect until February 
1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange. For your 
convenience, a copy of the Resolution is also included in this Notice.

If you have any questions concerning the new rule amendments, please contact 
George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; 
Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

NATURAL GAS: APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX
RULE 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES

Rule 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES
(A) Initial Price Fluctuation Limits for All Contract Months. At the 
commencement of each trading day, there shall be price fluctuation limits in 
effect for each contract month of this futures contract of $1.00 per MMBtu 
above or below the previous day's settlement price for such contract month.

(B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any 
contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is 
offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes 
consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a 
Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggering 
Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes, 
there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract 
months of that futures contract and the associated option contract 
("Temporary Trading Halt"). The market will remain open during this 
two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Halt 
shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice period.

(3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end 
of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all 
contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price 
fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in 
this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previous 
day's settlement price for such contract month.

(4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there 
shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limits 
for the remainder of the trading day.

(C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading 
resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue 
until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following 
exceptions:

1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less 
than 15 minutes before the close, then, when trading resumes after the 
Temporary Trading Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to 
provide for fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of 
trading, and the closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of 
this 15-minute period of trading; and

provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed 
during  the closing period, there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt for any 
contract month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month.

(D) Application of Price Fluctuation Limits to NYMEX ACCESS(r) The limits 
described in this rule shall apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r), except as 
provided by NYMEX Rule 6.56 and except that:

(1) if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed during the last ninety 
minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session, there shall be no Temporary 
Trading Halt and no expansion of price limits during the remainder of such 
NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session, and

(2) there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt during a NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading 
session if, in the opinion of the President of the Exchange or his designee, 
either the Triggering Event was not reflective of otherwise prevailing market 
conditions or a Temporary Trading Halt is unwarranted.

(E) Exception for Last Three Trading Days of an Expiring Contract Month.

(1) RTH Session on Last Three Trading Days. Notwithstanding the preceding
sections of this rule, there shall be no limitations on price fluctuations 
for any Natural Gas futures contract month during the entire RTH session of 
the final three trading days in the current delivery month.

(2) NYMEX ACCESS( Session on Last Three Trading Days. Price fluctuation limits
for all Natural Gas futures contract months on these three trading days shall 
remain in effect for the NYMEX ACCESS( session as provided by this rule.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for 
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) and that 
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below 
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS(r):

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange 
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the 
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two 
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the 
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limits) 
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide 
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price 
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) shall be halted immediately 
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President's designee.  
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% of 
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched 
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) session, the market shall be 
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) traded 
for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price 
fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the 
RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided 
under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading 
occurred during the NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session.

I could not find Susan's e-mail address in our system (go figure), so I 
thought I would impose on you to forward this message to her, please.  Ed 
Straub of Duke energy called today; they have signed the amendment and he was 
not sure to whom to send the original.  To make things simple I asked that he 
return it to me; I will keep the original and send a copy to Susan for your 
files.

Ed asked that we send to him an electronic copy of the amendment.   Would you 
please process that request?  His e-mail address is: 
"edstraub@duke-energy.com".

Please ask Susan to call me if any questions.  Thanks bunch; and hope you and 
all the ENA staff have a great holiday season!

Novating our swaps to the Royal Bank of Scotland?  Thanks for your help.

We have several ISDA with Lehman Brothers.  Attached is an Icon that will

Further to our telephone conference call this afternoon I thought it would
be useful to set out the points that were discussed and the outstanding
issues together with an indication of who is responsible for the next step
on those points.  Please find attached a document which does this.  I
understand that the parties would like to have a further conference call
tomorrow or probably more likely on Friday to revisit these issues and see
what progress has been made.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any queries.

Any word back of City of Riverside?

I spoke to the traders on the West Desk, and "EPMI Long Term California" 
should be documented as Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  "Long Term California" 
is just a book on the West Desk

	Julie Brewer@ENRON
	12/27/2000 03:42 PM
		 
We have recently traded a few deals between EPMI Long Term California and 
Risk Management and Trading Corp. The way these are booked now indicates that 
a Confirm will need to be generated between the two. Joe Hunter thinks that 
these should probably be book to book transactions. The EPMI Long Term 
California entity has not been used for financial nat gas transactions before 
this. Can you shed some light on to whether or not EPMI should be considered 
a subsidiary similar to ECC or EES.

Thanks.

We never received any language from any EOL individual.  We have not 
discussed revision language for EOL deals with Legal or EOL.

   

Kevin,

Is there some specific revision language that we've been given by the EOL 
group for use with revised EOL deals?

Legal is claiming that we should have received something long ago from 
someone on the EOL side, but I don't recall ever getting anything.

Thanks,

Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis... unless I specifically 
mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for 
all the products that Credit has approved them for.  If I have an exception, 
it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.  Most of the comments I 
will have relate to financial counterparties:

For Financial

I am not responding to Credits "declined" counterparties.

1. AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company 
Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta 
Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty 
if the Confirms go out under that name.
2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are 
currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a 
draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to 
change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. 
name, I can approve it for financial trading.
3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading 
under Bayer Corporation.
4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning 
down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial 
trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy 
Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, 
which I will approve for financial trading under that name.
6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved 
trading under TMV Corp.
7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already 
approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of 
Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!

For Power

1.  City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade  
pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter.

Why do I keep getting these new products for approval?
	Melba Lozano

From an earlier email from Dovie Keprta:

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) (Leslie will be on maternity leave soon, so  Mark 
Greenbery will be the new lawyer contact) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss 
the process for executing NDAs.  Leslie/Mark will serve as in-house legal 
counsel for EMS while Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all 
documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

Someone must be cleaning out their office, because a notice of a 
restructuring from Black Stone Holdings Parnership mysteriously showed up on 
my desk, with no note.  I have no idea if Credit knows about this BECAUSE IT 
IS SO OLD!

The notice dated 4/19/99, says effective 7/1/98, Black Stone Holdings 
Partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Black Stone 
Minerals Company L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership.

Let me know whether or not Credit knew about this already...if not, I'll send 
a copy down to you.  It was my understanding from way back when that they 
were no longer trading under the Blackstone financial master, so this may be 
moot.  If we are trading with them again, we never did get the corporate 
documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an 
excuse to get them.

As you requested...

	Paul Finken@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS
	01/02/2001 02:09 PM
		 
Tana - Could you forward the Interliant NDA via email and write protect the 
document.  We've reviewed the fax copy which is fine and were going to send a 
copy electronically to the Account Rep at Interliant.  

thanks

I just got a call from Deutsche Bank a minute ago, and they got approval from 
Frankfurt and are overnighting the agreement to me for signature.  I'll keep 
you posted...
	Tana Jones
	12/05/2000 01:55 PM
		
The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy 
didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal 
team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before 
they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to 
Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!

We do have a Credit Support Annex in place.  Once we sign the ENA
agreement, we will make your requests to DB.

                    Clare.Godson@Alle

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I
will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare

Pinto-Leite and Frank Sayre.  They will need access to the Financial Trading 
Agreement Database.  In addition, I am still waiting to hear that Cheryl 
Nelson has been granted access to the Financial Trading Database.  Can you 
let me know what the scoop is...?

Also, I left you a message this morning about my new database for online 
documents...when can we expect a roll out of that?  People keep sending me 
documents and I have no place to record them...

Thanks, as usual for your help!

Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to 
the following people:

Anita Fam
Brenda Whitehead
Elizabeth Sager
Jason Peters
Stephanie Sever
Christian Yoder
Lorraine Filomeno
Shari Stack
Susan Flynn
Lisa Lees

Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit 
Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom 
Moran and Veronica Espinoza.

Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit 
access:  Cheryl Nelson.

Thanks!

Per Tanya's comments at our Legal/Credit Meeting yesterday, I would like to 
have the referenced counterparty come thru again to shut them down for 
financial trading.  Per Tanya, all financial trading for the Calpine family 
should be done out of Calpine Energy Services, L.P.

Attached is the form of NDA for distribution to your customer.

Carol,

Susan is out today.  Is what you want just a full set of the ISDA documents?  
Do you need a binder of our internal forms as well?  I have a bunch of 
trainees coming thru so Taffy just made up a bunch of new sets of ISDA 
documents and is 3 hole punching them and putting them in the binders...Do 
you want them messengered out to your home, or just available for you when 
you get back to the office?

	Carol St Clair

Tana and Susan:
I would like to keep some of my swap binders here at home so I can use them.  
Could someone make up a set of binders for me with all of the forms, ISDA 
definitions etc. that I can use at the office?  I'm hoping that with all of 
the new lawyers an extra set of the materials that we give to new lawyers and 
legal assistants is readily available.  Thanks for your help.  See you on the 
8th.

Bad news.  We got the Deutsche Bank documents in and they weren't signed by

an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of

The person we are dealing with is very nice, Stephen Kessler, their lawyer 
out of New York.  He has been very helpful.  We just don't know how long it 
will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop.  Our intention is to 
fedex the ISDA out to Steve tonight.  The Enron Guaranty will take a little 
more time, so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later, so we can 
keep the ISDA moving.

Can you draft a BETA and Fee Agreement for NatSource LLC.  Terms of the deal 
include:

$250,000 License Fee

We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware 
Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited 
partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global 
Counterparty #53350), a Delaware limited partnership, with El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350) as the surviving corporation.

By virtue of this merger, the ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/01/99 should now 
reflect El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. as the Counterparty.  In connection 
with this merger, Credit will be getting a new parent guaranty from the 
Counterparty.  Upon its receipt, copies will be distributed.

Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

I would think adding the name would be adequate; do you agree?

	
	                           
	

Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
12/31/00.

Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.

Notice No. 01-10
January 8, 2001

TO:        ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS
ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS

FROM:     Neal Wolkoff
          Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:     MARGIN RATE CHANGE FOR BACK MONTH CONTRACTS

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business).

Futures Contract:  Henry Hub Natural Gas.

Contract Months: April 2001 and all Subsequent Contract Months.

Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001 Contract and all Subsequent
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):            Old:  $7,000  New:  $5,000

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                Old:  $7,700  New:  $5,500

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):            Old:  $9,450  New:  $6,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.

Because there is a difference between the outright margin required for the 
February 2001 and March 2001 delivery months and other months, each spread 
which includes one leg in either the February 2001or March 2001 delivery 
months will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at 
$11,500 starting on Monday, January 8, 2001.  This figure is determined as 
follows:

Example at Clearing Member Rates

One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG    (1 x $14,000)   =        $14,000
One Short April 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  
5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($14,000-$5,000) =        $  9,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $11,500

NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads:
Requirements for Spreads with One Leg in February 2001 or March 2001 
Contract,  and One in the April 2001 Contract or Subsequent Contracts

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $11,500

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $12,650

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $15,525

Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur 
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice 
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright margins for the NYMEX 
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.

Just as I suspected.  I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says 
he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them 
out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal 
course of business.

	Larry Joe Hunter
	01/08/2001 04:22 PM
		 
Stephanie,

We currently do a couple of deals per day through an Online trading system 
called DynegyDirect.  This is basically Dynegy's version of EOL.  We are 
sending Confirmations on these deals just as we do with all other deals done 
with Dynegy.  However, the CP is requesting that we not send these Confirms 
at all.  Our Traders click on the deal which is then legally binding.  Our 
back office personnel double-check our Trade Entry by going to DynegyDirect's 
web-site and checking the trade details.  Dynegy simply throws out our 
Confirmations once they determine it relates to a DynegyDirect deal.  I have 
told the CP that I would check with our legal dept about the status of 
sending Confirmations traded on DynegyDirect.

Let me know if you can get someone to comment on this.

thanks,
Joe

Jean Bell
01/08/2001 03:37 PM
Dynegy is wanting to know if we can show "Dynegy Direct" on our confirms in 
the same way that we show "EOL".    Dynegy has two separate systems, one for 
Dynegy Direct and one for their 'daily' work, and because no confirms are 
signed and returned or sent out,  our confirms are confusing when they do not 
find them in their system.  Thanks.

What a happy coincidence about the book!  We'll have to share thoughts when 
we're done reading it.  The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made 
it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.

I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.  He's having to 
work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian 
counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were 
covered in my class.  I told him if you two were paying more attention 
instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with 
a ruler up in Canada!  

Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you...

potential customers of EnronOnline want to see what they would be required to

Dear Tana,

Since we last discussed the above, I think I have only formally approved one 
Japanese counterparty.  I am a bit concerned that something may be slipping 
through the system.  Alternatively, no companies other than those on the 
initial list have applied for passwords.  The metals people here came to see 
me about one company recently but I have not been asked for approval re that 
company formally yet.

Thanks.

Per our earlier agreements with the Online Team, this counterparty is a 
division and I will not open them up to trade until the incorporated entity

I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online 
trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with 
us.  He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa 
Browning at (403) 543-7188.   I told him I would pass on the request to our

Much thanks!

Attached below is a spreadsheet report of Bandwidth contracts in the Global 
Contracts database.  As we agreed, the Bandwidth group either has or will set 
up new EBS Contract numbers for each of these agreements, provide the new EBS 
Contract number for EOL Reporting, and provide specific notations and 
information regarding inactivation of the Global Contracts database records 
so that we don't have 2 "master" numbers for any given contract.   

I do not have edit access to Bandwidth contract records in Global and it is 
my understanding that the Bandwidth group no longer uses Global -- therefore 
none of us involved in this process will have appropriate security rights to 
inactivate the Global database records.  I will request appropriate security 
access to inactivate the records.  Then, when instructed via e-mail from a 
member of the Bandwidth team, I will inactivate the Global Contract database 
records.

Our agreement is that I will continue to report Bandwidth master contract 
information to EOL until Profile Manager is in production -- with the 
understanding from EOL that I cannot see the contract data reported for 
Bandwidth masters contracts.

I confirmed that Powerex Corp. is the new name of British Columbia Power 
Exchange Corp.  Since there was just a name change, Powerex Corp. should have 
the same profile for US physical power as B.C. -- accordingly, Powerex Corp. 
is authorized to trade US West physical power only (NOT EAST power) pursuant 
to the WSPP Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any further questions about this counterparty.

Mark Taylor asked me to contact you about the referenced NDA.  He said you 
were the lawyer for Dealbench.  I'm a paralegal that works with Mark, and we 
got a call from a member of the Online Team, Dave Samuels, who said that "a 
lawyer" was working on an NDA for Dealbench, and he wanted to confirm that 
the agreement reflected Enron Net Works, not Dealbench, as the Enron 
counterparty.  Is this something you are working on and familiar with?  If 
so, can you provide me with a copy of what you are working on?  We appreciate

Make sure they're shut down for physical power.

Westpac:  I just approved that one on the 1/5/01 list.  There should be no

Mr. Harrell,

Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.  When we had a big group

level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.

Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off 
your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our 
counterparty.  In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we 
have arbitration in all of our agreement.  Our client over at EnronOnline, 
Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.

agreement used for DealBench with changes noted below).  Bridge did not 
return signed its counterpart of DealBench agreement, asking this morning for 
a mutual NDA which we have accommodated.  Jeff suggested that since we had to 
revise the agreement, we streamline the Net Works effort by making it the 
Enron counterparty (Net Works and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including 
DealBench) are covered by NDA).

Thanks for your help.

Nora,

I have a call into my business person.  I ran what's going on by Mark Taylor 
(you know, I'm just a paralegal, Mark's a lawyer), and got his permission to 
exclude the arbitration language from the agreement.  So I just wanted to run 
it by Dave, and then we're home free.  Also, I don't know who you had lined 
up to sign, but Louise Kitchen has strict rules that I have to have someone 
from her group execute all their documents.  Who would you get to sign?

	Nora Dobin@ENRON
	01/12/2001 03:35 PM
		
Update.  Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.  We have 
not provided a signed counterpart and will not until we hear back from you.  
If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the 
NDA again with DealBench as the Enron counterparty and you can have Bridge 
sign the appropriate NDA for Net Works.

I apologize for any inconvenience; we merely were trying to accommodate 
everyone's goals in a short time frame.

A couple of additional thoughts.  The mutual NDA covers Net Works and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries (which includes EOL).  Equitable relief is more 
likely than arbitration to be the relief sought for breach of an NDA and 
equitable relief is covered by attached.  We appreciate the need to conform 
to policy; these thoughts are shared merely in an attempt to help streamline 
the process for this transaction.  Again, just let us know how you would like 
to proceed.  Regards, NJD

Attached please find another draft of confidentiality agreement revised to 
(i) change the DealBench counterparty to its parent, Enron Net Works LLC, and 
(ii) make the agreement mutual in respect of Bridge Confidential 
Information.  I understand that DealBench (which continues to be protected 
under this agreement) would like to disclose information this afternoon to 
Bridge.  Accordingly, please fax a signed Bridge counterpart as soon as 
possible to me at the fax number below and to Jeff Bartlett at 713/646-8576.  
We will fax to you a counterpart signed by Net Works.

Update.  Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.  We have 
not provided a signed counterpart and will not until we hear back from you.  
If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the 
NDA again with DealBench as the Enron counterparty and you can have Bridge 
sign the appropriate NDA for Net Works.

I apologize for any inconvenience; we merely were trying to accommodate

Attached are approvals for January 12, 2001.  You'll note that several 
amended counterparties appear; in these cases ONLY THE CELLS HIGHLIGHTED IN 
YELLOW should be changed within the user profile for a given counterparty.  
Hopefully this will save some time both for credit as well as for product 
control.  As in the past, counterparties who are declined are crossed out 
across the profile.  New counterparties are highlighted as necessary.  

Please call if you have any questions; thanks.

I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to

reflecting this merger.  Do you?

Cheryl,

Please keep me on this list.  I need to get it because on EnronOnline.

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:

Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.

It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

Sure,

Just make sure that she has an updated book.  Also, can you verify that my 
book is updated since we use it to make the other copies.  Thanks.

Hi Tana - 
Cheryl Johnson has the document copies and will send you one. She is going to 
start distributing copies as she updates the system instead of waiting for 
the report sendout. If you want to be on the list, send her an email to be 
added.  Marilyn

I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to 
First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation 
reflecting this merger.  Do you?

She was on long term leave for about 4 mos. and then has to reapply to get 
another job someone in Enron since her job was filled in our group.  I heard 
she was back in the country, but I haven't heard whether she was going to 
come back to Enron or not.

Tana, in light of your instructions that we not work on confirmations until 
"confirm training" is complete, I am asking you to help resolve a problem 
brought to my attention by Mara Alexander at Cargill re: a confirm.  I had 
not worked on the confirm so this is the first time I am hearing about the 
issue.

As per Mara's fax, a copy of which I am forwarding to you, a confirmation was 
sent on Jan. 12th for a trade done on the 11th.  Although there is an ISDA 
pending for Cargill-Alliant, the Confirm that was sent does not, according to 
Mara, reference the pending ISDA.

Please let me know if you can help resolve this.  I have meetings all 
afternoon, so if I am not around, leave me an email.

Tana - this contract was done for purposes of procuring German news onto the 
Enron Strommarkt website (enronstromarkt.de) but we are now in the process of 
'porting' this information onto EnronOnline.  The contract is loosely worded 
and allows us to use the VWD news on any 'single URL ' of our choice. In this 
case, we're switching from Strommarkt to EnronOnline so no new contract is 
required though this does now concern EnronOnline.

The attached agreement is signed by Chris McKey (Enron ) but not VWD.       
(I will  forward you an English translated version too but of course it is 
not signed).

Michael - if you have the agreement signed by VWD please fax it urgently to 
Tana Jones in Houston.   Fax number: 1 713 345 7038.  Please also fax over 
any other executed agreements (with third party's signature) to Tana ASAP - 
I'm not aware of any others , are you?)  Thanks for your help.

AA to give final approval and assign .  We do have the short term agreement 
that was signed to provide the audit of the price reports from Nov. 1-30.  I

also has a copy).  Let me know if you would like to see that copy as well.

Thanks.

Tana - we also have an agreement that has either been signed or is about to 
be signed with Arthur Andersen (whereby they provide 'audit' services for our 
EnronOnline Price Reports (aka indices).  Julie Ferrara should have this 
agreement if one of them hasn't already sent it to you.

Julie  - could you also forward me this agreement assuming you have it? Would 
be useful to have it in our other discussions with AA re: SECA Coal index .  
Thanks).

I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced 
counterparty right now.  NCPA would like to get a password in place today to 
start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of 
transactions they can do online.  Per my earlier approval, this counterparty 
can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by 
Credit.  They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in 
place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading 
financial).

Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message 
is conveyed to her.

If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP!

Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the 
Atlantic?

Also, if a Confidentiality Agreement was executed in connection with the VWD 
file, we would need to provide a copy of that too...

We need to get the signed copy.

	Paul Goddard@ENRON
	01/18/2001 01:22 PM
		
VWD is actually NOT an EnronOnline agreement so it's  important everyone 
realizes this. It was signed by Chris McKey , formerly head of Enron 
Frankfurt office and , presumably by VWD.  We are simply going to be using 
the existing agreement (which does not mention EnronOnline whatsoever), since 
it generically allows us to use their news on ANY  single Enron website we 
choose (does not restrict us).  As such is it necessary to have the copy 
signed by VWD ?  I would have thought that the important signature was the 
Enron signature since we are paying them for a service , not vice versa.

All other agreements related to EnronOnline this side of the Atlantic are 
pending (non-executed) to the best of my knowledge. 

 Michael - do you know of any other signed agreements that specifically 
relate to EnronOnline in Germany?  

The only other one that has possibly been signed is an agreement with a 
company called IMP that Nick Mooney arranged for some sort of outsourced 
direct marketing work for EnronOnline (suspect this is very small potatoes 
but will find out).   However, I'd suggest you contact Kal Shah - he may know 
about this agreement if it does in fact exist.

Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the 
Atlantic?

I've heard about it, but I keep forgetting to check it out...!

I don't know that I need to get these lists from you that reference the

We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
ISDA to confirm trades under.

Credit has them as being an "ESP", which means they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant under the rules of the CFTC.  The CFTC sets financial criteria, 
such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial 
products .  Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but 
Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.

	Camille Gerard@ENRON
	01/19/2001 10:54 AM
		
Tana,
Thanks for the approvals.  One question though.  Credit approved American 
Color Graphics for physical transactions only.  However,
your sheet shows them open for financial trading.  Usually, you will close a 
counterparty for financial
if Credit does.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared

Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
promptly I would be most appreciative.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I

Notice No. 01-29
January 23, 2001

TO: All NYMEX and COMEX Division Members and Member 
Firms                                        All Clearing Member Firms
       All Compliance Officers and Operations Managers

FROM: Neal Wolkoff; Executive Vice-President

RE: Proposal to Increase Clearing Member Capital Requirement
_________________________________________________________________

The Clearing House Committee has proposed to the Board of Directors ("Board") 
that the capital requirement of a clearing member firm be increased to $5 
million.

However, the Board is giving interested parties an opportunity to apply for 
clearing member privileges while the capital requirement remains at its 
current level of $2 million. Thus, if a firm files with the Exchange a 
clearing member application no later than May 31, 2001, it will not be 
required to meet the new $5 million requirement until one year later, May 31, 
2002. The same effective date would apply to all existing Clearing Members.

Applications for clearing membership can be obtained from the Membership 
Department. If the Exchange does not receive any new clearing member 
applications by May 31, 2001, the proposed capital requirement increase to $5 
million will become effective for all existing clearing member firms on June 
30, 2001.

Should you have any questions regarding these issues please contact Artie 
McCoy, Vice President of Financial Surveillance at 212-299-2928 or Joe 
Sanguedolce, Director, at 212-299-2855.

At the request of Darren Vanek in Credit, we have done some preliminary due 
diligence regarding the ability of The Public Service Company of New Mexico 
to enter into financial transactions.  Based on our conversations with them 
and review of their Board Resolution, it appears:

1.  They are an investor owned utility, not a governmental entity
2.  Their Board Resolution ONLY approves electricity futures, options or 
swaps, and gas or oil futures, options or swaps.  
3.  THEY CANNOT ENTER INTO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OVER 18 MONTHS.  It is 
imperative that anyone trading with this counterparty be made aware of this 
restriction

Please call me if you have any questions.

Tana, PSC is in the process of merging with Western Resources, a Topeka, 
Kan.-based IOU with which we signed a very heavily negotiated ISDA master 
late last year.  When we send the draft of ISDA out, I think we should 
consider sending out  the version signed by Western Resources and tell them 
it is the same document that their soon-to-be sister company already has in 
place with us.

FYI, according to PSC's website, when the merger is complete, PSC and Western 
Resources will both be owned by a newly created holding company.  This may be 
of interest to credit.  -- Bob

Attached is a clean and redlined draft of the NDA.

There are two general forms that the online team uses for NDAs.  The first 
form is bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential 
business information.  The second is a unilateral, Enron Protected Party form 
and more thoroughly protects Enron's interests.  The second form should be 
used when Enron is the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please email me 
the following information:

 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where you would like me to send NDA and appropriate information (fax

Per my conversation with Peter earlier today, below is a list of classes that 
Mark may want to coordinate his Houston secondment with so he can attend 
some. 

Internal Classes:

Basics of Risk Management:  4/26 - 4/27  filling up-act quickly

Derivatives 1:  4/17 - 4/18  filling up-act quickly
                             5/8 - 5/9 - lots of room still here

The internal classes book up quickly.  Everything between now and April is 
already full with large waiting lists.  If he is really interested he should 
try and sign up for classes immediately.  He can do that by going to the 
"Development Center" Icon (aka "Ernie").  Then he can sign up on the computer.

External NYMEX Class:

I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows:

June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products
June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite)
June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite)

Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly.  Their 
February classes are already full.

As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques 
Festival is.  It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston, 
all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that 
time.  The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive.  
With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for 
wildflowers this year.

Anyway, the above may help Mark get the most out of his time in Houston.

Don't think so, but I'll check w/the NYMEX and let you know....

I just spoke to Dave Fuller in the Portland Office about a potential 10 year 
deal he wants to do as soon as possible with the referenced entity.  As we 
all know, because of the legal issues that arose out of the "Orange County" 
litigation, no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental 
entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and 
an ISDA Master is in place.   Also, besides the usual issues surround the 
governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions, we also need 
to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 10 
year w/o prior voter approval.

Credit, if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me I will prepare a 
draft ASAP and Sara will review it.  Dave should be calling you with the 
information.

Christian, if you have done any due diligence already on this counterparty we 
would appreciate any assistance/documents you can provide.

Thank you all for your assistance with this.

It is because we are required to due certain corporate due diligence prior to 
trading, which we don't do unless they really want to trade financial.  Most 
of these counterparties are really interested in trading physical products, 
so we don't bother to do the necessary due diligence.  If they really want to 
trade financial, we could transact w/o a master, we'd just have to check 
their corporate documents, file Consents to Service of Process, etc.  If 
we're doing all that we tend to say let's just get the master in place while 
we're at it.

Many thanks for this, and in due course I'll let you have updates for Europe.

I have a question for Mexico, Argentina and Chile:  Why is their a necessity 
to have Master Agreements in place for commodity derivatives? I would imagine 
this is driven by the Credit Dept and their preference for netting?  I can't 
think why there could be any legal objections - and I have read advice 
obtained by Brent H. for Chile and Mexico and no such restrictions are 
mentioned.

And also in relation to Mexico, could you find out what corporate due 
diligence is required of Mexican companies, in particular of the entity 
mentioned below, Femas Empaques SA de CV.

Many thanks

J

FYI-attached is my list of notes on online approvals, which includes the 
South American countries we currently trade with.

Justy-if you have any updates to the European countries, they would be most 
appreciated.  I have had no updates since Edmund fell ill.

 I am the "new" lawyer in charge of our financial trading operations in 
Mexico.

I am told that we do not trade financial with any Mexican counterparty 
without going through our normal due diligence process.  At the end of the 
day we need a Master in place with any Mexican counterparty with whom we 
trade (financial) online or otherwise.  I checked and we do not have a Master 
in place with this counterparty.

I asked Tanya to confirm for me who in Credit whould be getting the emails 
about signed masters, and below is here response.

Bill Bradford
Debbie Brackett
Tanya Rohauer
Jason Williams
Brant Reves
Russell Diamond
Rudwell Johnson
Daren Vanek
Veronica Espinoza
Paul Radous
Ken Curry
Aparna Rajaram
Wendi LeBrocq
Tom Moran
Nidia Mendoza
Wendy Conwell
Ed Sacks
Veronica  Gonzalez

Not all of these people actively negotiate docs (Tom, Veronica G, Wendi, 
Wendy,etc) but should be on the distribution nonetheless. The only people I 
have left off are EES, EBS, etc.  Let me know if you have questions.

Just a reminder that I'm going to be in a little late tomorrow.  I'm going 
over to the old TCB Bank bldg. at 9:00am to sign my loan papers.

Any chance of getting the confirms to say "Ashland Inc. through its Ashland 
Specialty Chemicals Comapny division"?

   

Per my conversation with Frank, we are opening up the referenced counterparty 
to trade financial under the division name  indicated above.

Thanks Tanya, you're the best!

Francisco,

You should have gotten my email back to Justin.

 We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates 
from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are 
responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London 
Legal for London based customers.

A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around 
the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both 
Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office 
is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while 
London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide 
copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we 
both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the 
approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. 
is responsible for their own clients.

As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the 
advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can 
transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks 
in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their 
appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and 
further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of 
process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since 
what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we 
don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a 
counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time 
resolving those issues.

As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest 
of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can 
certainly change our policies at any time.  All of the above is just what my 
current direction is from our lawyers.

I can answer this but my only question is whether we also "control" the 
process when the Enron entity is a UK entity?

FPL
Hi Francisco

Just so that I can inform the rest of my team and the marketing people - why 
is it that we require Masters with Mexican counterparties and not with 
counterparties from other countries?  Would it make any difference if the 
Enron Entity was in the UK like Enron Metals Limited rather than US?

Does this apply for offline trading as well?

Regards,
Lara

Dear Tana;

     Our trader/Darryn Light/BNP Paribas CIT, sitting in our London office  is
     Is that corrrect?
     If so, do we go directly through Enron Houston to get the system placed 
on
his computer or do we contact Enron personnel in London?
     Do we need to coordinate Enron London IT personnel with BNP 
Paribas/London
IT personnel?
     Can you assist us with as much information as possible?

     We await your response accordingly. Thanks much. Kind regards

Hey Peter,

Due to my wife's pregnancy, I was hoping to schedule my secondment to Houston 
such that I would be back in Calgary no later than the end of April.  In this 
regard, I have managed to enrol in the Basics of Risk Management Course for 
March 29 - 30, 2001 (can be cancelled without charge up to March 26, 2001) 
and the Derivatives 1 Course for April 17 - 18, 2001 (can be cancelled 
without charge up to April 12, 2001).

If possible, I would like to begin the secondment on Monday, March 19, 2001 
and return to Calgary on Friday, April 20, 2001.  Please let me know what you 
think when you get the chance.

Thanks,

Mark.

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  

I'll keep you posted when I hear from him.

Here is a rough first draft of our jurisdictional database (summary of swap 
laws).  Besides the obvious typos, how does this work for you?

Don't know about the Shell intermediary part.  I hope that will be spelled

Place with them, so we could put the trades under that master.  I don't know 
if we want to upgrade the master at this time, or just stay where we are.  He 
said we didn't have a master w/Apache, but when entered my notes into lotus 
notes I noticed we did.  I called him back, he didn't know ERMS was the same 
as ENA.

Apache is investment grade, but they are not bank quality.  In actuality, I

It's pretty darn old and pretty ugly.

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it.
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange Agreement
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

This is basically a REALLY old, it looks like heavily negotiated, form.  This 
might be a good time to replace it.  I don't know how much trading we do with 
Apache.

              at 11:30am - 1:00pm in EB49c4

   ***Lunch will be provided***

  If you will be unable to attend, please advise.  

  Thank You, 
  "Z" (Zionette) Vincent, x5-4858  

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

At the request of Jake Staffel, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
sign the NDA and return it to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  If you have any 
comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.

Please shut down the above counterparty from trading all financial products.  
They are no longer an ESP.

mary,

are these in the swap forms bank so we can't alter them by mistake?

Attached are the Multicurrency ISDA and applicable CSA forms in Word.  These 
documents are for your internal use in study, negotiating and the like.  I 
find it useful to be able to use search and find for concepts etc. in 
negotiating and understanding the guide and definitions.  These documents are 
not to be used externally, ie emailed as the "form," since we have a general 
rule that we always utilize printed versions of the form with our internal 
clients and external customers.

Cordially,
Mary Cook

The Finance Group is trying to locate some really old "Master Agreements" 
done in 1995.  We looked around and we didn't have any masters in place for 
the counterparties, but I was thinking maybe they really weren't "Master 
Agreements" but our old style confirmations.  The two counterparties were 
State Street Bank, as Trustee for Cash I, and Citibank as Agent, for Cash I.  
The Agreements were listed in the closing documents as "Interest Rate 
Agreement" and "Commodity Swap Agreement".  Can you look around and see if 
you have some really old active trades out there for either of those 
counterparties...?

So not to confuse you, about 2 or so years ago, we did some deals for State 
Street for the Cash VI Project.  The master for Cash VI is  actually is 
listed in the Financial Trading Database.

Thanks for your help!

Taffy,

Mary is the new lawyer in charge of the paralegals (someone needs to keep us 
in line, being the wild and crazy gals we are!).  Can you put these 
re-occuring meetings on my calendar and call it "Paralegal Lunch Meeting".  
Thanks!

Please note that we will commence our lunch meetings together as of Thursday 
February 15th from 11:45 to 1:00.  The meetings will generally recur every 
two weeks thereafter so mark your calendars.  I will let you know the 
location as soon as we find an open conference room.

Carla, by copy to you please find a conference room and schedule it for the 
recurring time as above stated and let us know which room.  Also, set on your 
calendar reminders for emailing a reminder to the paralegals and myself each 
Wednesday prior to the Thursday meeting, and for ordering lunch/drinks for 
each meeting.  Also set a recurring meeting on my calendar noting this 
meeting schedule.

Thanks.

Harry,

Since physical steel is a new online product, I need to know from you wheth=
er=20
you are aware of any reason why any existing counterparty should not be abl=
e=20
to trade physical steel.  From your perspective, I would consider whether=
=20
there is any legal reason barring a counterparty incorporated out of the US=
=20
from buying physical steel, or whether you are aware of any current=20
litigation, payment disputes or other similar legal reasons which would=20
prevent an existing counterparty from trading physical steel.

Also, on a going forward basis, is there any legal impediments for any new=
=20
counterparties trading physical steel?

Lisa,

I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy =
an=20
existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new onlin=
e=20
product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because=20
counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if=
=20
their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  Wh=
at=20
I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any=
=20
counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartie=
s=20
up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm th=
is.

Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,=20
because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issu=
es=20
specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just =
in=20
case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...

I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.

Notice No. 01-42
January 31, 2001

MEMORANDUM

TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff , Executive Vice President

DATE:  January 31, 2001

RE:  Six-Month Extension of Resolution Governing Price Fluctuation Limits   
Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS

On December 12, 2000, the Exchange issued Notice to Members #421, which 
consisted of a reminder to Members of an Exchange Resolution in effect that 
concerned Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to 
trading on NYMEX ACCESS(; That notice stated that the Resolution would 
continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members were notified otherwise by 
the Exchange.

The purpose of this Notice is to advise Members that the Exchange has 
extended this Resolution, which is attached below, for another six months.  
Thus, this Resolution will continue through August 1, 2001, unless Members 
are notified otherwise by the Exchange.

If you have any questions, please contact Rick Taibi, Director, NYMEX ACCESS 
Operations, NYMEX ACCESS Department, at (212) 299-2677; or Brian Regan, 
Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

* * * *

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEEOF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for 
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) and that 
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below 
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS(r):

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange 
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the 
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two 
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the 
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limits) 
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide 
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price 
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) shall be halted immediately 
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President's designee.  
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% of 
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched 
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) session, the market shall be 
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) traded 
for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price 
fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the 
RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided 
under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading 
occurred during the NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session.

Hi Tana,

This email is in response to my earlier voice mail regarding two NDAs to be 
sent out today.  Here's what I think may be the pertinent information:

Continental Airlines - Cargo
1600 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002
United States 
Attn:  Mr. Ed O'Meara

Eagle Global Logistics
15350 Vickery Dr
Houston, TX 77032
Attn:  Mr. Stephen J. Carattini

Content might say something about not mentioning any details about talking to 
Enron about air cargo commoditization with any other company or to the press, 
etc. until we give them express written permission.  

I'm sure I forgot something relevant.  Just give me a call at 5-9323.

I will be taking Friday off.

Nope.  Would you like me to call Mr. Fazio or would you like to?

At the request of Jake Staffel, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
sign the NDA and return it to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  If you have any 
comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.

	Walter Guidroz@ENRON

language a bit.

	Fred Philipson/ENRON@enronXgate
	02/01/2001 10:33 AM
		 
Tana,

Thanks for your help.  We will hold off on sending one to Continental at this 
time.  Please have a lawyer initial the EGL NDA with the following changes:
? Their legal name is EGL, Inc.
? Remove EnronOnline
? Replace EnronOnline with more ambiguous terminology, should we choose to 
put the product on "a different platform or product or service offered by 
ENW."

I'd like to get this signed and sent out today.

Thanks,

Fred

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

Below is our password to the ISDA Netting Opinions.  I'm stating the obvious, 
but please do not provide this to anyone outside Enron.

I've been booked up lately for various things (mainly people's new babies and

I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you
are.

Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be
working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for you
to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!!

Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!

Are we currently doing any trading out of BT, or are we doing it all under 
Deutsche Bank now?

Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.  She  was about 5 
lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother 
Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He 
was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little 
boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over 
to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it 
because the baby was early.

I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?

I don't think we have any active deals with BT.    

I looked at the website and it looked great!  Alena's photo of Chris is 
really good.  She has quite the eye.  And Chris's photo of the kitties looks 
like it could be in a kitty calendar.  The photos of Daniel were really good, 
especially that close up.  He really is a handsome baby.  I am going to have 
to get one of those cameras so I can send Chris photos to post of the 
Website.  Maybe we can start the Jones family monthly magazine and publish 
stories, articles, etc.  one a month.  I can be the editor.  Chris can be the 
layout guy.  What do you think of that.  We could require every family member 
to send something in once a month!

Hi Tina,Check Chris's  website http://www.Ridgeway. Love  Ma

Correct.  The Services Agreement in place between ENA & ECC is what allows us 
to transact between the two companies without adverse tax consequences.  We 
have no such agreement in place with ECTRIC, and the UK tax regime is 
different.  We cannot transact between ENA & ECTRIC under each others masters.

	Anthony Campos
	02/07/2001 08:31 AM
		 
Per my voicemail, 

My first thought would be that the Credit Suisse (ENA) Master Agreement would 
not cover London Pulp & Paper transactions because they are not included in 
the Services Agreement like ECC.  Please advise.

Thank You,
Anthony
Global Financial Contracts

There is an ISDA Financial agreement in Global Contracts with ENA and Credit 
Suisse First Boston International (95000405-0), dated 21/4/1993, but it's in 
the Houston Maintenance group, and therefore Antony Campos should confirm 
whether it's ok. I will be speaking to him as soon as he gets in.

Please could you confirm whether Credit Suisse First Boston International 
have a Master Agreement in place for Pulp and Paper products with ECTRIC or 
ENA? They have just been approved for trading on Clickpaper without 
collateral and I wanted to make sure that they did not have a master in place 
before I went ahead and set them up on the system.

We have received a letter dated 2/6/01from Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, counsel to 
Fletcher Challenge, with respect to the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge by 
Shell Overseas Holdings Limited, and Shell's proposed subsequent assignment 
of the Fletcher Challenge Canadian nat gas trades to Apache Corporation.  I 
am sending copies of this letter to Russell Diamond, Mary Cook, Greg Johnston 
& Joe Hunter.

 Russell, I need to know if we would agree to the assignment of the trades to 
Apache. 

Russell, Mary:   With respect to such assignment, we have an old ERMS ISDA 
Local Currency Master Agreement in place.  Do we want to continue to transact 
w/Apache under this master, or use this as leverage to get a revised ISDA 
master in place?  Among the issues I quickly spotted in the Apache master 
were:

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation instead of loss for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election (maybe I'm 
blind)
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange 
Agreement-time to update
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold-is this sufficient all this business?
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

Joe Hunter, I am going to send you down the letter which has what they 
believe to be all the Fletcher Challenge trades listed.  Do we agree?

As usual, they would appreciate a prompt response so they can get this 
assignment completed.  Thanks you all for your help!

ECT has a policy that prohibits employees from trading in any commodities 
that ECT trades.  Please make sure any future trading you may do complies 
with this policy.  Thank you.

Peter,

I don't know what letter you're talking about...

Here are the documents for Prebon and the order of what happened:

1. Tana sends to Prebon

2. Mark Greenberg incorporated Prebon questions into our LOI

3. Mike Bridges deletes one sentence and forwards to Prebon

4. Mike Bridges eliminates red lines of #3 above and sends for Prebon 
signature (we should receive this document with a signature).

Lets just make sure that #4 comes back and that it is consistent with #2 with 
the only difference being the elimination of the last sentence in paragraph 2.

I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status

Our outside counsel has confirmed that the Partnership is a General 
Partnership under Alberta law under the name Nexen Marketing (f/k/a CXY 
Energy Marketing), and the GPs are Nexen Inc., Wascana Energy Inc. and Nexen 
Holdings Canada Ltd.  The GPs would each be jointly and severally liable for 
the Partnership as I outlined previously.

I will fax Ed and Mary a copy of the Partnership search when I receive it..

My assistant will forward the message I received from outside counsel.

Peter.

Our outside counsel tells me that there is no record at Corporate Registry of 
Nexen Energy Limited Parnership.  I think you need to confirm the entity and 
the org. chart.

Also, the ISDAs are kept in Houston, as legal Houston is responsible to 
prepare.  Nonetheless, we generally keep copies, but do not seem to have an a 
copy of an ISDA with CXY Energy Marketing, CanadianOcccidental or Nexen 
Energy in the Calgary office, so I cannot confirm if it makes any reference 
chnage of control MACs, etc.

Peter.

Just a few points, which I explained to Ed yesterday:

1.  If Nexen Energy is a Limited Partnership formed under Alberta law, and 
Nexen Inc. is the General Partner, Nexen Inc. is jointly and severally liable 
for all obligations of the Partnership until it ceases to be the GP.

2.  Upon Nexen Inc. ceasing to be the GP, it will remain jointly and 
severally liable for all unfulfilled obligations of the Partnership incurred 
to us up to the time it ceases as GP unless we otherwise agree.

3.  The result is therefore equivalent in substance (if not in detail) to a 
Guarantee from Nexen Inc.  The only difference is that if a Guarantee is 
terminated, we have written notice of termination to act upon, whereas Credit 
may have to monitor the structure of the Partnership to ensure that Nexen 
Inc. remains as GP.

4.  This is structure which we have been willing to transact on in the past 
in numerous other cases, subject to the following:

(a)  a specific MAC event for Nexen Inc. ceasing to be the GP; and
(b)  a specific continuing rep. of the Partnership (breach of which would 
result in and E of D) that it is a Limited Partnership formed under the laws 
of Alberta, and that its GP is Nexen Inc.

5.  If Ed wanted more comfort, I suggested that we could add Nexen Inc. as a 
party to acknowledge that the Partnership is a Limited Partnership formed 
under the laws of Alberta and that it is the GP, and to covenant that it will 
provide written notice in the event that it ceases to be the GP.

6.  In terms of what is the actual structure, although I believe credit 
typically resolves these issues, the contractual matters referred to above 
should go along way to address Ed's concerns.  I also suggested to Ed that he 
do a preliminary search of the Nexen Inc. web page to get an org. chart and 
information, and then to follow-up with Nexen Inc. to get a copy of the Proof 
of Filing of the Certificate of Limited Partnership issued by Alberta 
Corporate Registry for Nexen Energy, which should indicate Nexen Inc. as the 
GP.  In any event I have asked outside counsel to obtain a copy of the the 
Proof of Filing, which I will circulate upon receipt.. 

I trust the foregoing is helpful.

 

Edward Sacks@ENRON
02/06/2001 07:18 PM
As per the attached credit worksheet, please amend the ISDA dated 11/17/98 
between ENA and Nexen Energy (formerly CXY Energy Marketing).  This will need 
to be placed on a priority list as Andre is intending on transacting in a 
short time frame.  In addition, I believe that it would be prudent to get 
some form of confirmation regarding the corporate structure (general 
partnership).  We have historically been operating under the assumption that 
Nexen Inc. is general partner and I have underwritten the credit based on the 
financial health of Nexen Inc.  Unlike a formal guaranty agreement whereby we 
would receive notice if the guaranty were to be revoked, this structure is 
difficult to monitor as there is no obligation to notify Enron of ownership 
changes and new transactions may be entered into without the support of Nexen 
Inc to the extent a change in the structure has occurred.  Please reply with 
comments or questions.

I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status 
of your reviews.  When each of you has completed the review of your products 
can you let me know, so we can sign off on that product.  Sheri is being 
pressured by our traders to get this up and is also getting daily calls from 
the President of Tradespark.  She would like to have everyone's sign off by 
Friday if possible.  Can you let me know whether this will present any 
problem.

Thanks!

I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at 
Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.  There was some 
misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way 
we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the 
online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.  They 
want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be 
happy to generate the master.  Can I get some credit from you so I can turn 
around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will 
then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.

Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!

Are all the moms, dads, and babies doing o.k.?  Aunts?

I was just kidding about Hannibal.  What's on your mind?

I've been booked up lately for various things (mainly people's new babies
and home improvement tasks).  I've been wondering where you disappeared to.
Do you want to do something this weekend.  There are a few new chick flicks
I wouldn't mind seeing...

                    "Patti Young"
Ms. Jones,

I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you
are.

Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be
working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for
you
to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!!

Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!

Obviously, you're aware that Brent Hendry had problems when he tried to log 
in yesterday.  Now Wayne Gresham has tried to log in and can't get in 
either.  I expect no one else can get in, they just haven't tried yet.  Can 
you go over your directions and figure out what's wrong.  Thanks...

We are not ready to execute an agreement with them until we have had some 
discussions with them about their authority.  Please send them the ISDA then 
have them call Mary Cook to discuss the agreement.

Hi Tana,

The ISDA that I faxed you is not executable, can you send me one that is?

Dave

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

With respect to the attached list, please note that for Credit's "amended" 
counterparties, there will be no change in our original approvals except as 
noted.  Also, I have not responded to the "declined" counterparties, so those 
noted as such are not approved for any products (I didn't want to go through 
and "X" out all the boxes).

I just spoke to Brent and he still cannot get into the website.  Can you get 
with TradeSpark and figure out what the problem is and how can we get our 
people access.  Thanks.

I also want to see how your house is coming along...

Attached are the Multicurrency ISDA and applicable CSA forms in Word.  These 
documents are for your internal use in study, negotiating and the like.  I 
find it useful to be able to use search and find for concepts etc. in 
negotiating and understanding the guide and definitions.  These documents are 
not to be used externally, ie emailed as the "form," since we have a general 
rule that we always utilize printed versions of the form with our internal 
clients and external customers.

Julie,

Just an FYI.

Depending on the type of contract, when I get them in I check them to make 
sure they have been correctly executed, and then, for the most part, I send 
the originals to Dave Samuels, who I have designated as the original file 
keeper for the non-trading related online documents.  I keep copies of the 
contracts here so we have a backup copy.

I am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract 
online we have.

Tana,
We just signed another contract with Arthur Andersen today for an audit on 
our EnronOnline price reports (this new copy is a long-term one similar to 
the short-term contract we had in December).  Mark Greenberg handled this 
contract, and Mark has the final signed copy.  

Mark was going to ask you who keeps the final copy, but I thought you were 
keeping them now!  Let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks Tana.

Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the 
system.  He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, 
and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.  We 
cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can 
only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an 
unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.  As soon as we 
have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your 
review at that terminal.

Thanks for your patience.

I just got a call from Select Energy and they would like to get an ISDA in

Per my voicemail, it appears we sent a draft of an ISDA to Susan Pharr at 
Select Energy in September of 2000.  Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, 
worked on that master with Ed Sacks in our Credit Dept.  Susan's phone number 
is (713) 853-4737 and Ed Sack's phone number is (713) 345-7712.  You might 
want to contact Susan Pharr to get a copy of the ISDA.  If you can't find it 
call Susan and she can get you another copy.

Yes, I compared their blackline below against the draft I originally sent 
out, and the only changes were to the counterparty name, "or its affiliates" 
language, and NY from Texas, the same changes showing in the blackline below.

Mark,

I have reviewed your standard form NDA and have noted two minor comments
thereon.  I have suggested the State of New York as a more neutral
jurisdiction and one that is widely used in commerical transactions, rather
than the State of Texas.  The other comments are self explanatory.

Please contact me should you have any concerns.

I just wanted to let you know that I got the revised draft out by Fedex.  I 
think it may take 2 days for Fedexes to make it up there, so I didn't want 
you to think it didn't go out if you don't get a copy by tomorrow.

How did you decide to handle this?

Tana,

Tara and I are auditing the EOL bridge and noticed that the Phillip Allen / 
Reliant Energy deal from 11/28/00 is still unresolved.  Can you tell me what 
ever came about of that.  This is the transaction where Phillip mistakenly 
put the incorrect product on the web, Reliant hit on it, and then Phillip got 
out of the deal by talking to Reliant over the phone.  

Please update me on what happened.  I know it happened awhile ago......

Thanks,
Dawn

If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.

Attached is my proposed form of Guaranty to cover the US & UK business with 
Paribas.  Tanya, please note, per our discussion I have increased the 
guaranty amount to $50mm.  We have also added ECTRL to the Guaranty.

Please let me know if it meets with your approval and I will forward it to 
Paribas in NY.

Kate Cole's office sent me down your executed certificates, and I am going to 
Fedex them over to you.  Have a nice holiday!

Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary 
office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Please let me

Tana,

Elizabeth is interested in keeping the Enron Corp. Guarantee Agreement 
embedded in our EEI Agreement as close to the one you guys use in the Swap 
Group as possible.  Are you the one in the group that keeps up with any 
changes made to yours and do you also spearhead getting Clement's blessing?  
We noticed a couple differences in the one attached below from ours and was 
wondering when this form was last changed and any reasoning on why it was 
changed.  Also, how can I be notified when there is a change to your form?  I 
would be glad to copy you also on any changes we make to our form.  Please 
advise if you are not the right contact and if you are, let's discuss.

Thanks,

Just to be sure we are working with the "latest form" of Enron guaranty, 
could you get from Tana the most current swap one and the check it agaianst 
the one we use for EEI - I would think they should be the same;  if not, lets 
discuss. Thanks

You'll see that I asked our group to keep you updated on the guaranty form.  
Carol St. Clair just wanted to make sure that you had our latest form of 
guaranty, so I am sending it to you at her request.

I updated Lotus Notes.

Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the 
status of the following documents that were sent to them by Enron last fall: 

1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our 
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.

2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial 
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about 
the EEI). 

3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the 
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us. 

Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever 
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to 
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go 
any faster.

Thanks,

Shari Stack

I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
can be examined on a case-by-case basis.

Hi Tana,

A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk 
Management Glossary booklets.  Am I getting close? I've found it to be very 
helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.  
Could I get a copy for him?  Any other good power references?

Thanks,

Bud Ricketts called up and just wanted to get an email of the physical power 
agreement, I think because he wanted to make comments on the form on the 
computer so he could prepare a blackline draft.

	Shari Stack
	02/13/2001 04:37 PM
		
Tana - Can you please let me know your query.  Bud Ricketts has had a draft 
physical power agreement since Sept. of last year. As you can see from the 
Lotus Notes entry- I called him yesterday to chase him as we have not gotten 
even a first set of comments from them.  Their Credit Guy is apparently the 
hold-up.

I am not sure what else needs to be done from our end. Please advise. 

Thanks!

Shari

As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA 
Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank 
ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the 
name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and 
Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.

All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to 
Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust 
Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.

As a followup:  This guys name is Mykhaylo Koshel and he is an outside 
consultant with the New Concept Group.  I've got a messenger going over to 
Allen Center to pick up a copy of the agreement with them.  I'll get a copy 
to you as soon as I get it.

Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.  Per my 
conv. w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. 
based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power 
products, and vice versa.  I don't know how you want to handle that, I have 
not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.  What should we 
do on a going forward basis?

I called Steve Douglas to check on who should be our tax contacts, and he 
said he, Jeff Blumenthal and Morris Clark can certainly help us with trading 
related tax issues.  However, he is grooming Susan Musch to become the lead 
trading tax person, so we might want to start calling her.  Her ph no. is 
x56010.

Do you want me to call Steve Kessler re: Enron Corp.?

Yes, you do not have access to Lotus Notes, because I have been hung out to 
dry.  They don't have time to keep up with our demands for access, so they 
want me to do this, and they have sent me instructions and are working on 
getting me the level of access to change approvals, but I'm not there yet.

How long will it take for them to grant me access?

Angela D. Davis

Jay,

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E 
days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message 
on...

It is not clear to me how we should handle this, what do you sugguest?  As a 
note, I will be out of the office on Friday.

Richard, Craig told me you could review and sign this confidentiality 
agreement, naturally it might need a little editing.
John and Denis--

Here is the proposed confidentiality agreement.  I wasn't sure about the
exact name for you, so I just put in the generic "Enron".  Let me know if
this is okay.

Call me if you have any questions, and I'm looking forward to reaching an
agreement with you.

Thanks.

My boss Mark Taylor was handling this with Phillip Allen.  I don't know what 
they ever resolved.  I forwarded your email on to Mark and I left a voicemail 
for him to please respond.

Tana,

Tara and I are auditing the EOL bridge and noticed that the Phillip Allen / 
Reliant Energy deal from 11/28/00 is still unresolved.  Can you tell me what 
ever came about of that.  This is the transaction where Phillip mistakenly 
put the incorrect product on the web, Reliant hit on it, and then Phillip got 
out of the deal by talking to Reliant over the phone.  

Please update me on what happened.  I know it happened awhile ago......

Thanks,

Russell,

On Public Service Company of Colorado,  I don't know why you have this on "no 
financial trades", but if it was because of the contract authority problem, 
that has been resolved, so you could open it up if that is the reason.  See 
Lotus Notes for more detail.

We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the 
referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed.

Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct 
input into the EOL System).  I will now only see amendments to counterparties 
that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be 
coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.  So, on amendments that affect 
power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.

For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales 
only.  Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid 
and the offer.  Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales 
only, or open them up all the way?

Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.  
Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather 
quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to 
proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe 
give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know.

Tana:

This email is just a follow-up on the telephone message that I left for you 
earlier today.  As I explained, our firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) represents 
Apache Corporation and I will be replacing Saul Laureles in concluding our 
work related to the assignment of certain natural gas price swaps from 
Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited ("Fletcher Challenge") to Shell 
Overseas Holdings Limited ("Shell"), and the reassignment from Shell to 
Apache Corporation. My contact information is as follows:

Robert J. Viguet, Jr. ("Bert")
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White Williams & Martin
1200 Smith Street, Suite 1400
Houston, Texas 77056
Telephone:  713-654-9693
FAX:   713-658-2553
rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com

You should have received a letter from Saul Laureles dated February 6, 2001 
via overnight courier requesting that your firm confirm certain facts related 
to the swaps to be assigned as described above.  We are looking for a written 
response to that inquiry at your earliest opportunity.  If there are any 
errors or other discrepancies in the list of swap transactions or other 
matters identified in the letter, we need to know as soon as possible so that 
there will be time to resolve those issues before the assignments are made.

This firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) has prepared a draft of the Assignment and 
Assumption Agreements for the transfer of the swaps from Fletcher Challenge 
to Shell and from Shell to Apache Corporation. Our draft of the assignment 
forms is being reviewed by attorneys for Shell now, but should be available 
for your review in a few days. The acquisition of assets of Fletcher 
Challenge Energy by Shell and Apache, and the related assignments of the swap 
transactions, is expected to closes in early March.

If you have any questions or comments concerning the proposed transactions, 
please don't hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

This communication may be protected by the attorney/client privilege and may 
contain confidential information intended only for the person to whom it is

notify Robert J. Viguet, Jr., by telephone at (713) 654-9693.

At the request of Rahil Jafry, I am attaching a copy of our proposed First 
Amendent to License Agreement, which extends the term from February 28, 2001 
to April 30, 2001.  If the Amendment meets with your approval, please execute 
it and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any questions 
or comments please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Rahil at (713) 853-3206.  We 
look forward to hearing from you.

No change yet.  We are short w/space & computers, and my assistant is working 
with our computer floor tech to find a computer and some space so our lawyers 
can log into the system.  Two our our lawyers are now out for the week, our 
gas & power lawyers.

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say "Minerals 
Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459. 
	Samuel Schott
	02/21/2001 10:12 AM
		
Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

Have a Great Day Tana !!

I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.  What are you discussing 
with Carr?  Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?  
Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?  Who will be providing the 
confidential information?  It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA 
once I get this info.  I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on 
the email.  Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is

I would like to execute a non disclosure agreement prior to our meeting.  If 
possible, please email Mark Thomas our non disclosure agreement as soon as 
you can.

Thanks,

Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial 
payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the 
business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down 
immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline 
and online, until this payment dispute is resolved.  

At the request of Dan Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will

We are going to be discussing a potential joint business venture around a

the originators in Rex Shelby's group would suffice.  Also, the bilateral 
form is best as they will be sharing information about the industry and their 
companies experience in the industry.

files are $682 each and the 2-drawers are $362 each for a total of $5,948 
(includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
now without this information, but will need that shortly.

I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat

This is contrary to the mandate of EnronOnline, which is to make global 
products trading available to our customers.

If there is a specific reason for shutting down a company, then we must do so 
- but we cannot restrict companies from trading products simply because we 
don't think they want to.

How about this as an alternative:

1) Define the rules which are applied to restrict companies for trading (e.g. 
Must have a Power license to trade Power)
2) Distribute the appropriate rules and company lists between the NA primary 
legal contact and UK primary legal contact (for profile purposes)
3) Each legal group (NA and UK) apply each others rules to the companies 
which they are reviewing
4) Each legal group copies the other with the final company profile which 
they are sending to Frank Davis.

In this way, profiles should be correct as they leave each legal group, but 
each group has the opportunity to scan the work of the other. If there are 
any problems, then the customer profiles can be corrected - if necessary 
after the fact.

This exposes us to (in my opinion) a very small risk that:
 1) The rules for one group are not correctly applied by the other or there 
are extenuating circumstances for a particular party and
 2) The error is not caught before the customer transacts (bear in mind that 
after legal completes their review, there is still a great deal of time 
before the customer can transact, on account of: profile completion process, 
mailing time, customer delay before trading)

I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
can be examined on a case-by-case basis.

I just spoke to Credit about one counterparty on the list.  You've got Utah 
Municipal Power Agency shut down to trade since they're not FERC authorized.  
They specifically came through online wanting to trade power, and Credit 
wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get 
whatever evidence you need to get them open for power.  The name of the guy 
that sent the application in is Richard Judd and his ph no. is (801)

Congratulations, Enron employees!  Fortune magazine ranked Enron number 24 =

Fortune=01,s "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" list is primarily=

Because companies are getting better and better, the competition was fierce=

At the request of Rahil Jafry, I am attaching a copy of our proposed First 
Amendent to License Agreement, which extends the term from February 28, 2001 
to April 30, 2001.  If the Amendment meets with your approval, please execute 
it and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any questions 
or comments please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Rahil at (713) 853-3206.  We 
look forward to hearing from you.

As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements 
contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms 
contained in the atty.fms bank.

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from

the

to
the novation letter is a 23 page deal by deal list of all novated deals (why 
they
can't just say "all outstanding deals", I don't know).   Should I fax this up 
to you?

As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements 
contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms 
contained in the atty.fms bank.

Tana,

Regretfully, I will no longer be able to submit Application Access Requests 
for you.  Until now, I have submitted e-requests on your behalf, and I feel 
that removing myself from this process will help to reduce turn-around times 
on your requests, as they will no longer have to come through me.  Below, I 
have included detailed instructions on how to submit an e-request for the 
Financial Trading Agreements Database.  Going forward, I would be glad to 
assist you if you have any questions (on the system and on submitting 
e-requests).  

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Mike 3-3363

e-request Instructions:

1. from your web browser: pull up http://itcentral.enron.com <--or click this 
link
2. click on the "e-request" logo/link
3. select "Corp Logon", you'll then be prompted for your corp login (the same 
one you login with in the morning)
4. then select "Add/Remove access..." under "Update Account Access"
5. chose the user/requestee from the available list of users (and choose 
appropriate priority)
6. next, click the  "Applications" button (the one with gears on it)
7. then click "show all"
8. from this list, scroll down to "Lotus Notes Application - Unlisted" and 
click the "+add" button
9. In the box provided, list "Financial Trading Agreements" and also include 
the group name - in this case "ECT Legal - Swap - Users"

Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary 
office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Please let me 
know when they have access.  Thanks!
That would be good.  Peter.

If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.

ECT HOU_LN1/ECT
Legal\new_swp.nsf

I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this 
database.  Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them 
through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA 
Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank 
ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the 
name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and 
Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.

All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to 
Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust 
Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.

You should have edit access now.  Why don't you go try and see if it works...

How do I do more than one request at a time.  Can you call me a x33399?

Good afternoon,

Please submit an eRequest for the access request (all 5-7 people can be 
placed on one request).

To view the Group members, please open the ECT Address book, click on Groups, 
then double-click on the name of the group.  Please let us know if there are 
any questions.

Have a nice day,

I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this 
database.  Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them 
through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

I'm worried - is the above still working at Enron or has she not been out on 
holiday for awhile?

Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.  I have added 
at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because 
I know that one comes up frequently.  Also, I don't know if you want to also 
suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as 
our LC form.

The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are:

Mark Taylor:  Financial Trading
Jeff Hodge:  Physical Gas Trading
Elizabeth Sager:  Physical Power Trading
Alan Aronowitz:  Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions 
& Metals)
Julie Murray:  Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)

Mark Greenberg asked me to send you the Password Application to be used for 
the brokers.  Actually, there will not be a Password Application.  What they 
will be signing instead is the attached Fee Agreement.   Any questions, call 
me, Mark Taylor or Mark Greenberg...

I ran it by Mark and he has no strong feeling one way or another about the 
comma thing, so whatever you prefer.

Hi Mark and Tana,

I called the Dept. of the interior and was subsequently given the number to 
the Director's office.  I was told that anyone there could help me. and I 
asked the woman who answered the phone what the legal name is.  She stated 
that the legal name is Minerals Management Service.  I asked if U.S. Dept. of 
Interior should be included as part of the legal name.  She said that it 
should appear as follows:

       U.S. Department of the Interior 
       Minerals Management Service

I'm about to make the correction in Global Counterparty.   Do you have any 
objection to putting a comma between them, because we do not have 2 lines to 
set it up in GCP as written above?

Cheryl x33103

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say "Minerals 
Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459. 
	Samuel Schott
	02/21/2001 10:12 AM
		
Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

Have a Great Day Tana !!

Samuel x3-9890
(GCP_Enron Networks)

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.

A novation is just the European based format for doing an assignment...

	Tanya Rohauer/ENRON@enronXgate
	02/28/2001 02:45 AM
		 
 
One more time... can you explain the difference between assignment and 
novation?  We expected them to assign all of the BT trades to DB didn't we?
Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want
to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't
thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like
on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full
novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until
we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers
Trust financial trades and master sit.

I tried to get you access yesterday, there are three Angela Davis's in the 
System, what's your email address?

The GSCI contract is based on a basket of 26 commodities traded on a variet=

Each Clearing Member providing sufficient documentation of a properly=20

good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
big deal.  Promise!

I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with 
Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE 
lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.  We have an ISDA 
in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those 
products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.  The trader is 
pestering me about this.

What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here 
in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except 
getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with 
ENA).  Is that OK with you?  

Is Ian a lawyer, paralegal or Credit person?  Also, Mark mentioned the London 
Legal has been restructured somehow, and he asked me to ask you if could you 
fax us an org chart that shows the structure...?

I hear you got a fancy new car!

All,

We a have new updated form of: (a) Enron Corp. Guaranty, and (b) Counterparty 
Guaranty.

This new form is located in the directory for:

 SWAP FORMS -- Current Forms 

 and is identified as:

 guaranty(2-14-01).doc

Please begin using this new form immediately for all financial transactions.

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey

Attached are the referenced lists.  If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I 
don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty 
unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep 
the Legal approvals the same).   The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list 
was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list.  
For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European 
based physical power products.

I know I'm a pest...but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its 
legal entity as part of the name.  This one is on the list of 2/21/01, and it 
is the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Department of 
Energy, acting through it "CRSP" area (I'm not sure what that stands for, 
it's the Central something something area) (ID#71175).

This particular counterparty has come up before on EOL, acting through 
another area, the Upper Great Plains Area (ID#81177).  The way I had this 
counterparty approved for EOL (I thought!) was:  Western Area Power 
Administration-Upper Great Plains, a Division of the United States Department 
of Energy.

I don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too, but it would sure 
make Legal happy if we did...

Mark, thank you. We would request that in Paragraph 3 the "Except as
otherwise provided" languge be deleted and the language below be added in
replacement.

"The parties acknowledge and understand that this agreement does not limit
or restrict the ability of either party to engage in its respective
business, nor does it limit either party's use or application of any
information or knowledge acquired independently of the other without breach
of this agreement in the course of such business.

Is this acceptable?

Stephen -

The below language is acceptable; however, I would suggest it be placed as
the first sentence of Paragraph 3, if it remains TradeSpark's position that
the existing first sentence of this paragraph (beginning with "Except as
otherwise provided ....") is to be deleted.  If the existing first sentence
is to remain, the language you propose should be added as the second
sentence of paragraph 3.

Please confirm the above and I will move forward on finalizing the
agreement.

execute the Agreement.

Stephen -

Since we keep missing each other, I wanted to drop you a note about the
comments TradeSpark made to the Enron NDA.

As to the comments:

Paragraph 1 - The changes are acceptable.

Paragraph 3 - The rationale for this deletion needs to be provided.  I
cannot see why this change was made or is necessary.

Paragraph 5 - This deletion is unacceptable to Enron.

When you get a chance, please call me to further discuss Paragraph 3.

Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the 
system.  He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, 
and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.  We 
cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can 
only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an 
unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.  As soon as we 
have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your 
review at that terminal.

Thanks for your patience.

The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access 
to EnronOnline.  We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and 
he is really hot to trade.  Can you give me some estimate of when we can 
expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit 
issues?  His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.  Thanks!

Attached is the link that will give you view access to the Financial Trading 
Agreement Database.  View access is available to all Enron employees, so you 
can pass this link on to other members of your department or your dealmakers.

Hi Tana,

Just a quick reminder--will you please send me the elctronic version of the 
NDA we talked about yesterday?

Thanks!

Well, I got your new website added as a shortcut in my mail directory, so now 
I can bother you at will!  Watch what you pray for, you just might get it!

We had a rather uninspiring flight back from New York, Craig watched 
"Inspector Gadget" on the inflight movie(he said it was really bad) and 
Danelia read the Bible the whole way.  The only good news is we arrive 1/2 
hour early!

The weather was so warm in Houston that we had to turn the air on in the 
car.  It cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters.  When I got home I 
spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where I 
moved them for the freeze that never arrived.  That's one thing I hate about 
Houston winters, you can never count on it staying cold so I have to keep 
moving the plants in and out.  

After that, I aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter 
box.  Then I ordered in Chinese and read three days of newspapers.  Very 
relaxing!  Don't I have an exciting life?

Keep in touch...

Did either of you send this agreement to Anthony.

I have received an executed Futures Agreement for Carr Futures, Inc.  
(CP#57764) from legal.  It is an old agreement that dates back to 1996.

I see where this counterparty is in Profile Manager but would like for you to 
verify whether or not this agreement should be set up for on-line trading.

Thanks,
Georgi @5-4435

I saw this list in the computer and you're on it.  When you get back give a 
call and I'll come around and take a look.

We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.  It is 
located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side 
opposite of me, at EB3858D).  Since it has taken us so long to get access 
into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products 
descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Can you each please confirm 
to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the 
product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.

If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason, 
our floor computer tech, ASAP.

Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,

Below is the link to our Financial Trading Agreements Database.  This 
database reflects all the master swap agreements we have executed or out in 
draft form.  I just updated The Chase Bank to reflect the amendment for your 
re-hypothecation of securities.  Stephanie Panus, the paralegal that worked 
on this amendment, is having a copy walked down to you.

I thought you might find this database helpful to look up the status of

this database helpful, feel free to pass on the link to them.

Did you want this cpy on the list for Legal/Credit meeting?  ERMS hasn't been 
expanded as an Enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting, 
and we have some old ERMS era masters people are working on that aren't 
getting discussed, and some ERMS era masters that should be unchecked so we 
do not discuss them at meeting.

Please remember that when adding a new counterparty whose name start with the 
word "The", the "The" should go out the end of the name in brackets.  An 
example is "Times Mirror Company (The)".  This will help our searching 
capability.

Thanks.

You might want to talk to your Credit team about the Top Ten List for the 
Legal/Credit meeting.  I think we're only at 3 top ten.

I tried ridggway@concentric.net and it didn't work.  Is there some type

We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products 
online.  Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will 
need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.  Justin Boyd 
in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of 
the master.  Could you please provide us with credit for this master.  I 
don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.  
Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe 
and change it for UK issues.  I would suggest unless we really have problems 
with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.

Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for 
the rotation.

Attached for transmittal to your customer is the Prebon BETA and Fee 
Agreement amended to reflect the changes from the LOI.  I am also attaching a 
blackline so you can see the changes from the first draft.

or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel at (713) 345-8897 or 
Bob Shults at (713) 853-0397.  We look forward to hearing from you.

John, it's good to hear from you!

A few things on your paralegal friend.  First, we don't currently have any 
openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.  
Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, 
we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.

Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a 
big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to 
start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her 
resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, 
keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise 
paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.

Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire 
paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by 
Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good 
way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her 
undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more 
options in other groups.

As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.  I'm just 
surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my 
mileage to 6.  It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.  But I do want 
to start training in July with Houston Fit for the Houston Marathon again.  

We have received the signed faxed copy of the Letter Agreement dated 12/28/99 
amending the ETA for the referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed.

Just a check, my notes in the database say we had this counterparty open for 
power, but when I check on profile manager, they have a read only status.  Do 
we want them open for power or not?

Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank 
into their own subdirectory called "Swap Forms" (look it up just like a 
person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database 
from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't 
know if you can access other subdirectories.

We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit 
Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a 
comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined 
forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now 
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms 
directory.

Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may 
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up.

My database is not showing that I've looked at this counterparty before, so I 
need to know if they are an ESP, or not?

We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a 
CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and 
that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?

Edmund Cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made 
as a result of the new CFTC Rules.  I told him we just met on that yesterday, 
and as soon as we revised the form, we would send it to London.  Also, if 
there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this, 
please let him and he will disseminate the information to London Legal.

Do you know who in London is actually updating Legal's comments to Profile 
Manager?  I can't believe Justin does this everyday?!

I'm with you on Montana.  I checked the files in the big file room, and it is 
a Montana corporation.

	Walter Guidroz/ENRON@enronXgate
	03/06/2001 11:19 AM

We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a 
CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and 
that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?

Can you please change the name of the corporation from "Inc." to 
"Incorporated".  Thanks.

Good!  I thought I just had a checkup with Bikesport shortly before I stopped 
riding.  I was just a little afraid I might need grease.

Hey, FYI,

I took your bike by Bikesport on Saturday and was going to leave it and the
guy looked at it on the spot and said it looked to be in great condition.
He aired up the tires and all I need to do is get on it and ride it!!!

Thanks again.

Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
cooked meats.  They were delicious!

                    "Patti Young"
Morning, Glory,

Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.

I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
big deal.  Promise!

This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we 
had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.  When I checked 
Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the 
bid and offer.  Do you still want them to do power sales only?  Both east & 
west?

Thanks, I know I've been a pest to you today!

Is there any reason why this counterparty has transact on NL power?  I cannot 
believe they have a power marketing license there?

Profile Manager also has this counterparty on transact for other European 
financial products.  Are we really trading those products, because I don't 
think we should be ...?

Hi Tana, when I spoke to you last week regarding the FedEx bill charged to 
one of our customer (Lake Side Packers) you gave the company number which is 
great then you gave me a billing code.  Accounting has come back to me 
indicating that they need a cost centre.  The billing code number apparently 
does not mean anything to them.  Can you please forward me the cost centre to 
which this FedEx bill should be charged to.  Thank you in advance for your 
help.

This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or "Master Swap 
Agreement" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for "Restrictions" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as "crude oil trades only", "no trades over 2 
years", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  Per earlier emails, 
no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear 
otherwise.

Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was 
already approved yesterday to do basis financial.  All other prior approvals 
for that counterparty should stay the same.

Nope, not yet.  I'm absolutely swamped...!!!  I haven't forgotten about it 
tho.  My short agenda is Day 1:  Go over basics of financial documentation 
w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of 
detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 
2:  Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can 
prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a 
credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving 
online counterparties), Day 3:  Spend time with you & Peter going over what I 
went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any 
of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time 
approving online counterparties).

Don't add a lot of people on, I get really nervous speaking in front of large 
groups...I am a shy girl, you know!

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Notice No. 01-26
January 19, 2001

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING FIRMS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION OPERATIONS MANAGERS

FROM:
Neal Wolkoff
Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:
MARGIN RATE CHANGE: FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL 2001 CONTRACTS ONLY

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).
Futures Contract: Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures.
Contract Months: February, March, and April 2001 Contracts Only.
Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the February and March 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $14,000  New:  $12,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $15,400  New:  $13,200
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $18,900  New:  $16,200

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business.)
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $5,000   New:  $6,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $5,500   New:  $6,600
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $6,750   New:  $8,100

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin 
level required for the February and March 2001 contracts, the April 2001 
contract, and all subsequent contracts differ.  Spreading between differently 
margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than between equally 
margined contracts.  Below are provided three spread scenarios where the legs 
of the spread are margined differently.

Scenario One
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in the April 2001 contract will have its requirement 
(at the clearing member rates) calculated at $8,500 starting on Friday, 
January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) =    $12,000
One Short April 2001 NG   (1 x $6,000) =-   $6,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$6,000)=    $6,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =+   $2,500
Total Requirement     =    $8,500

Scenario Two
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in any month following the April 2001 contract will 
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $9,500 
starting on Friday, January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) = $12,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG (1 x $5,000) =      -$5,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$5,000)= $7,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =      +$2,500
Total Requirement    =        $  9,500
Scenario Three
A spread consisting of one leg in the April 2001 contract and another in any 
month following the April 2001 contract will have its requirement (at the 
clearing member rates) calculated at $3,500 starting on Friday, January 19, 
2001.
Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long April 2001 NG          (1 x $6,000)    =        $  6,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($6,000-$5,000)  =        $  1,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $  3,500

Summary of NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads
Scenario One: February or March 2001 Contracts versus the April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  8,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $  9,350
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $11,475
Scenario Two: February or March 2001 Contracts versus Contracts following the 
April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  9,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $10,450
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $12,825
Scenario Three: April 2001 Contract versus Contracts following the April 2001 
Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  3,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $  3,850
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $  4,725

McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice

to be.  In either case, the Enron principal to the transaction would be

Let me know if I need to contact them.  Thanks,

Hi Karen,

Did you follow up with this counterparty yet?  If not, I'll look after it.  I 
just don't want both of us calling her.  Thanks.

Matilda

FYI -- The counterparty question below includes reference to a Canadian 
Physical Gas master contract for online trading.  I am not certain which 
other agreement they are questioning (online GTC? online ETA? other master 
contract?).  When I tried to contact the counterparty her voice mail states 
that Debbie is out of the office until March 6th.  At this point, I am unsure 
if this is a purely "Canada gas" question or if they have questions that 
cross-commodities and locations.  No specific action is needed by your 
group.  I just want to make sure you are aware of any Canadian contract 
issues.   (There is an open EOL Help Desk ticket pending until this question 
is resolved.)  Please let me know if you have any questions or new 
information that might help resolve this issue.

Thank you,

I've had no list come throught with this counterparty.  What's the scoop?  
Will it be on tomorrow's list?

The referenced counterparty is on the 3/1/01 list.  You've got them shut down 
for power, but Credit's notes are specifically opening them for power.  
Should I open or shut down?

I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.  Per 
this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade 
financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the 
power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to 
trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them 
some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll 
get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval 
from Shari). 

If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate 
it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, 
so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly 
hold things up.

originator in Canada that per someone in Enron Canada's legal department, 
Canadian contract participants are not held to the same standards as US (i.e. 
they are not required to have minimum assets &/or equity etc.).  Is this 
true???  Please advise and forward to me the eligible contract participant 
information we discussed at the happy-hour last wednesday.

Mary,

All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get 
into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the 
o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can 
get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London.

	Susan Bailey
	03/13/2001 09:08 AM
		
Mary,

I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter.  She said that even if we move 
the forms within atty.fms, that the satillite office will still not be able 
to access them.

The only way that the forms whether in stty.fms or SWAP FORMS can be only 
accessed if one can access our "o" drive.
Therefore, each satillite office must contact computer security @ Enron an 
request access to our "o" drive.

Thats the story. 

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey
	Mary Cook
	03/13/2001 09:02 AM

subdirectory, which is located within the SWAP FORMS directory.

For your convenience in tracking our changes, set forth below are redlined 
version of such forms:

  

Further, there now exists a new version of Annex B for ECC.  The changes 
therein coorespond to those made under the Annex B for ENA.

If any of you would like clean versions of such documents, please access them 
through the SWAP FORMS directory.

Cordially,

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

	Sara Shackleton
	03/14/01 05:35 PM

Mike,

I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are 
showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as 
well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other 
agreements access to that information.  Our brokers are quite confidential.  
The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the 
master swap agreements.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me.  
It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.

	Sara Shackleton
	03/14/01 06:32 PM
		
You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of "Other Agreements" in the "All Agreements" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

covered under the Master Agreement with Hess Energy Trading Company LLC.

Thanks. Julie

At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of 
Interest.   This LOI has been revised to cover US crude, refined products and 
coal and emissions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute 
the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then 
have it executed by Enron Net Works.  If you have any comments or questions 
please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 
853-0397.

That was pretty good!

An unlikely pair.....

He can call any one of the attorneys in the Swap Group, Mary Cook does 
Canada, but she'll be out next week so it would have to be quick, or Sara 
Shackleton or Brent Hendry.

** PRIVATE **

Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, 
I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that 
prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the 
end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the 
issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our 
consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to 
modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and 
that we could then "compare notes."  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron 
Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly 
quickly.

Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to 
accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects 
CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability 
to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or 
regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to 
a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to 
be characterized as a "default" (which should not be a problem from our 
standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., 
in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely 
affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law 
that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the 
CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the 
hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a 
FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he 
did say that CDWR might entertain a "no LD walk right" for EPMI if such a 
change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will 
back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is 
heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying 
LDs.

Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.  
With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was 
discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk 
from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a 
date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as 
possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) 
(our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA 
Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were 
issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI 
would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment 
grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.

Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 
days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is 
sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the "bond guys" are already 
nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the 
LDs).

Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I 
requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend 
perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other 
events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with 
us on that.

Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an 
event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having 
a Downgrade Event a "no LD walk right" for EPMI and perhaps an event 
justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event 
would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would 
be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog 
also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit 
Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event 
that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the 
Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without 
LDs.

Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not 
be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a 
Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like 
to discuss that further with CDWR.

LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would 
accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency 
among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more "objective."  My 
sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.

Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the 
following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort 
actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, 
holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was 
made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs 
issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political 
environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that 
this is not a "deal breaker" for CDWR.

Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this 
issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue 
as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if 
assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our 
reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we 
said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult 
sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the 
assignment standards are in the other deals.

New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges 
was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.  
Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di 
agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it 
was fair for us to be protected from that.

Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would 
be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not 
they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility 
that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so 
we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.  
Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to 
extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that 
before our walk right expires.

Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we 
have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed 
internally with CDWR.

Pro Rata "Spread" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of 
amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would 
run it by CDWR.

CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it 
plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request 
for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted 
information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things 
start to fall into place.

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty 
on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was 
ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the 
scoop?

Thanks for your help!

I have received the following originally executed documents from the 
referenced counterparty:

1.  EOL Customer Registration Form
2.  Password Application
3.  Amendment to ETA

These copies will be walked down to you.

Sam,

I think counterparty ID# 754 is Bonneville Power Administration, not 
Bonneville Power Association.

Taking a look at BPA from the 3/8/01 list, I noticed that we've got them 
opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid.  I have no 
notes that they are restricted in that manner.  What's the scoop?  Marcus, do 
you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side?

Tana,

The problem has been fixed. The select statements of each of the "views" 1-12 
to exclude "Other" Agreements.  The view "13. Other Agreements" excludes all 
"Regular" Agreements and in addition all "Other" Agreements are excluded from 
the unsecured All By C/P view that everyone in Enron has access to.  Please 
check/verify that the "Other" Agreements are no longer showing up in the All 
By C/P view(s) and let me know if it still needs attention.  Hopefully it 
doesn't.

Thanks,
Mike 3-3363
Mike,

I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are 
showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as 
well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other 
agreements access to that information.  Our brokers are quite confidential.  
The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the 
master swap agreements.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me.  
It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of "Other Agreements" in the "All Agreements" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

Sara Shackleton
It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

Tana:  I think the agreement is listed in Section 1 (all agreements) which is 
not just Master Swap Agreements.  It is also listed in the approprate Section 
13 entry.
Hope you're enjoying Canada!

Sara Shackleton
The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!

The only restriction is coming from our cautious, power credit team wanting 
to only sell to BPA at this time.

through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

We have received executed copies of the Broker Electronic Transaction 
Agreement dated 3/19/01 and the Fee Agreement dated 3/19/01 with respect to 
the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be sent to Lisa Lees.

I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the 
referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that 
VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power 
confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain 
revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I 
looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved 
them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't 
allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override 
letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to 
handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and 
then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!

product types in Enron Online.  In each other description, the text you see

Tana,

This confirms our conversation today regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's
ability to trade on Enron On-line.  As discussed, I will check to see what
specific products we intend to trade with regard to Energy, Physicals,
and/or Derivatives.  I will also check to see whether we intend to trade in
the US, Canada, and/or Europe. I do understand that you cannot give me an
accurate answer as to our ability to trade On-line until I provide this to
you.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, I will try to do the
same.

Regards,

Dana M. Dellacona

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

Gee, I don't know who to thank for this honor.

Russell,

Stephanie called yesterday and said this counterparty called EOL and wanted 
to get opened to trade financial online and get an ISDA in place.

I spoke to Tom Moran about this counterparty this morning to see if we saw 
them as a swap counterparty before I called them, and Tom told me that he did 
not think Credit wanted to trade financial with this counterparty.  He asked 
me to pass the counterparty's name & number on to you so you could give them 
a call to break the news to them.  The woman who called is named karen and 
her no. is 713/974-9394.

 

At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Re: Glencore Commodities Limited (cpy 92858)

The counterparty is my work queue is Glencore Ltd., (cpy26313) not the 
above.  Is this a mistake?

Do you know the progress of getting a physical power master in place with 
this counterparty?  Can you keep me apprised.  They are obviously a 
quasi-affiliate and we have internal people contacting me checking on their 
progress.  Thanks!

Why do you say OK for weather?  What restrictions do you have for

hi tana

they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power) 
- the standard exceptions would be US power, weather and credit derivatives

Peter's message below contains a form of NDA that was provided to New World 
by both EBS and Enron Puerto Rico.  While I realize they are not Net Works, 
if this form is acceptable, do we have to have special approval from ENW

with the attached form and need to finalize this for Peter.

Lou,

Attached is the requested NDA with Enron Networks.  I added in the business
purpose regarding the Online Website.  This is form of the Enron NDAs
negotiated with Enron Broadband Services and Enron Puerto Rico.  This form
is different from the form Enron Net Works sent you as referenced below.  In
order to keep our NDAs consistent, David thought it would be best to stick
with one form agreement.  This form was the one sent to us by the other 2
Enrons - not our form.

Sharon,

Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and 
saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for 
this counterparty in January of this year.  I would just confirm that the 
credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.  I am going to 
fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can 
check the credit.  Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared.

Sharon,
As Canada is now executing these confirms, please get with Tana, or someone 
in her group, for an explanation of your questions.  Your questions all apply 
to standard procedures that the Legal group in Houston handles.  I did, 
though, make a mistake on Cash Collateral, you are correct there is no cash 
collateral in Canada. Please disregard that 'X' for both counterparty's.  In 
regards to the complete name of Slater Steel, as I explain in the comments of 
the worksheet, a previous transaction was executed with a credit annex 
attached to the confirm.  Once again, Tana or someone in legal, can explain 
to you the database they have that would give you all this information.

Thanks,
Russell

Russell, sorry, I should have reviewed the entire credit sheet before 
e-mailing you earlier, but I have a few more questions:

1. What is the complete name of Slater Steel?
2. Who is their guarantor?
3. What does "NW" before the C$188MM under "Guarantor") mean?
4. Cash Collateral??
5. What are the 3rd Party debt threshold amounts (Events of Default) for each 
of Slater's Guarantor and Enron Corp.?
6. Is Enron Corp.'s MAC debt rating BBB-?
7. Why is the Counterparty "X'd" under the MAC if there is a guarantor?

I think that are all of the questions I have for now.  Please advise.

Please note, however, that I will be away from the office next week.  Please 
forward your comments to Linda Sietzema if you don't get them to me by today.

Thanks,

We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.  Our 
notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on 
3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed.  
My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha, 
but they have not yet shown up here.  If you sent them fedex and can track 
them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.  They appear to 
have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has 
now become a really high priority.

Thanks!

OK with me!

Things are looking better.  We tracked down the documents and it appears that 
Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.  I just 
spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the 
signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.  Once we 
get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the 
ISDA.  I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in.

Brant, please do not put me on emails for day to day business, drafts of 
masters and confirms.  Thanks.

Trade qy8453 and qy9133 were both approved under the same credit terms.  The 
$4MM LC that has been specified as an independant amount and the associated 
$6MM credit line should be made a part of both confirmations and tied to both 
deals.  Approval of these deals was based on the combined risk profile of the 
trades, so securitization of both trades should be amalgamated.

thanks

Please prepare an Annex B per terms of the attached credit worksheet and 
provide a copy to the confirmations group for inclusion within trade qy8453's 
confirmation.

please execute the Second Amendment and return it to me via fax no. (713)

or questions please call me at (713) 853-3399.

Thanks,

What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?  I think this 
is really confusing for our Canadian team.  There must be requirements for 
the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.  I just don't 
think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure 
out.  What do you think?

Linda & Sharon,

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.

We have received the originally signed copy (via fax) of the Termination 
Agreement dated 3/15/01 with respect to EnronOnlineTransactions Nos. 10000172 
and 1000173.  Copies will be distributed.

We are closing to finalizing a Lotus Notes Database for us to keep track of 
approvals for online trading counterparties and any amendments to online 
trading documents.  Once the database is done, I (and you, I guess) will have 
to input the data for the Houston and London based Credit counterparties.  I 
am forward to you this early draft of the database for you to see what it 
looks like.  You will have to go into "create new counterparty" to see the 
format once you opened the database up.

 We're still revising it to add a drop down for amendments to online trading 
documents, and then we're going to have a sort similar to the Pending Swap 
Update sort on Lotus Notes, that will show the Counterparty Name, Approved 
for Online Trading:  Yes or No, and then follow with any amendments to the 
online agreements.

This will, obviously, help us keep track of if and why we've approved a 
counterparty, and also help us generate reports to the online trading team.

Access will currently be granted to the same people who have access to the 
Master Swap Agreement Database.  If you have any additional Credit Online 
People to add let me know.

We hope to have it ready within the week so we can start populating it with 
the information.
	
	

be up in a second.

At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will 
then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please 
call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 
853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.

I am OK with what Credit say, which is if the counterparties are already 
approved for trading those pulp & lumber products theyan trade the new 
products, except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp & paper deals 
that came into the fax area.  Is anyone looking for this stack of confirms?  
If not, I'll have Reggie walk them down to Joe Hunter.

I tracked down the culprit who worked on this master and it was Mark Taylor.  
I know he called Jon McKay and had a conversation with him about it and is 
looking at the master for particular issues in response to his conversation

Tana,

Per my voice mail to you this week, I have obtained the information which
you requested regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's ability to trade on Enron
On-Line.

Amerada Hess Corporation would like to trade gas and power, financial and
physical, in the United States and Canada.

We would also like to trade options for gas and power.

Could you run the necessary reports and contact me with our current ability
to trade On-Line?  Also, if we do not presently have the ability to trade
the above, could you inform me as to the steps which need to be taken in
order to trade?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Another Division

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?
	Samuel Schott
	03/28/2001 01:09 PM
		 
FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Best Rgds.

Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?

	
	

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

   

	
	                           
	

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

do to get it!

(includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
now without this information, but will need that shortly.

I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat 
Scarborough (x35368).

How goes figuring out why our positions were so far off?

Will,

I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so 
I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.  I also need 
to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a 
one way form that protects Enron only.  In circumstances where we are certain 
Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to 
use that form.  Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential 
information you are discussing so we can protect the information being 
discussed.

With respect to your email below,  I am already working with Bob Bowen on 
assigning the various Aquila trades.

On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me 
for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they 
are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc.  If you 
get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.  Once I get 
that I can prepare the assignment.  I will also need the name and phone 
number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.  I don't 
know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?  Once I get 
all this I can prepare that assignment.
Susan Flynn

 Tana - can you respond to this?   Thank you!

	
	

Susan,

We have several EOL deals (Amoco Energy, Aquila Energy) in which the 
Counterparty's Trader has done Financial deals through their entity that 
usually only does Physical deals.  Mark Taylor and others had decided that we 
couldn't simply agree to change the name of the Counterparty but would need 
to Assign such Transactions to the correct entity (BP Amoco, Aquila Risk 
Mgt).  Do you know if someone in Legal is involved with assigning these or 
can we draft something down here?

Thanks,
Joe

Cynthia Gin

Just FYI... several deals came across on my invoice for Amoco Energy Trading 
Corporation, but should be BP Amoco Corporation (BA 03400).
The deal numbers as follows:

N54185.1
N54970.1
N54977.1
N55023.1
N56595.1
N57893.1
N59629.1

I changed the invoice to reflect BP Amoco Corporation and wanted to notify 
you of the change.  If you have any questions regarding the above,
please call me at x3-7598.

Thanks!

Can you handle this request from Sabre.

-John

John
The Sabre NDA that you made revisions to has been passed on to me from
Gary Potter here at Sabre.  I have obtained comments back from our legal
department regarding changes that were made.  In the version you sent
back to us the supplement page and reference to it had been deleted. If
I can explain why we have structured our NDA's in this fashion.  If we
can get the basic NDA in place and agree on those terms, it is often
easier in the future to add a new supplement when ever the scope of the
conversations change.  This is helpful to save time in the future so
that other business units within Sabre do not have to negotiate terms
again.
I have made a few additional changes based on our attorneys request.
Please feel free to call me if needed, 817-931-4674.  If you accept the
changes made go ahead and sign the document and return it to me via fax
at 817-967-4756.
thanks

I think it may be possible that we have existing NDAs in place with the 
referenced counterparty.  The nature of our discussions that I am currently 
preparing an NDA for is the possible access to and use of a web-based 
transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade (including 
derivative products).

Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have 
chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada 
agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, 
and it might be missing some required US language.  I have also attached a 
redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form 
we first sent the form to the counterparty.   I have attached our current 
form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.  The Canadian changes will be color 
coded, so you can see them easily.

Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that 
have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no 
longer "eligible swap participants",  the current terminology is "eligible 
contract participant".  Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular.

I'm not showing I got your response for this day...

Those are negotiated changes.  The only was to tell what is a "Canadian" 
thing is by looking at the form.  It is color coded with different colors for 
different countries or other special legal issues.  I believe Canada is a 
purplely pink color in the form, the footnotes should tell you.

I never heard back from you.  You were going to look at my list of approved 
jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.  I'll be 
out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the 
phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were 
pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas 
countries and how I should respond about European countries.

Strictly informational.  I need to know everytime we have a governmental 
entity, so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a 
governmental I had to research that.  I was sharing the information I 
gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know

Tana, the products listed below (as I understand) comprise the initial 
products for the EOL roll-out.  It is unusual that ECTRIC, rather than ENA, 
will be the Enron party, even with respect to transactions that will be 
confirmed out of the U.S.  This is something Mark and I (as well as tax and 
credit) have scrubbed at length and approved.

Enron principal counterparty for each: ECTRIC
Each product is a financially-settled swap (NO OPTIONS)

(1) Coffee swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(2) Coffee swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(3) Coffee basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(4) Sugar swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(5) Sugar swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(6) Sugar basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(7) Cocoa swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(8) Cocoa swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(9) Cocoa basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)

I will immediately look into whether there would be special restrictions for 
swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa with respect to Australian, Singapore and 
Hong Kong counterparties (I think these are the three most likely non 
U.S./European jurisdictions at this point)

Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting authorized to access files in the O drive, and 
need to confirm which folders are ones that I would need.  The one labeled 
Legal seems appropriate.  Also, I understood from Alan that there is a folder 
with scanned in ISDA Masters that I need.   The thing of it is that I don't 
know what's in any of the folders, so it's hard to figure which ones I should 
get authorized for.

If you guys could help me identify which ones they are, that would be great.

Thanks,

Dear Tana Jones:

The New York Mercantile Exchange is excited and we want to tell you why.
NYMEX is about to launch enymexsm  and its prospects are invigorating.

Over-the-counter (OTC) participants will now be able to execute transactions
on the same platform as NYMEX futures.  The Exchange plans to use its proven
clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management,
and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a
consolidated clearing position.  Subsequent enymexsm functionality will also
provide an internet-based interface to the established Exchange futures
market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc
electronic trading system, depending on the session.

Attached please find information announcing the first slate of products to
be offered for listing on enymexsm .

Since we value your business as a forerunner in this industry, we are
enclosing for your review the sale registration form, which consists of the
enymexsm System User Agreement.  Please review, sign and return to Robert A.
Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
North End Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10282.  Any questions can be answered via
email at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429.

The signatory must be an executive officer or partner of the firm.  We are
also attaching two "click-on screens" that users will view when they first
log on to the system.

Please note that since the enymexsm products will be cleared you will also
need to obtain authorization from a clearing member for your account.

A NYMEX team, consisting of members of our Board, local traders and staff,
will be visiting each one of you in person.  They will discuss with you how
to utilize the benefits of NYMEX to achieve precision in many of your
customized transactions.

We look forward to receiving your registration and participation in what is
intended to be the premier, global exchange for forward trading and clearing
contracts focusing on energy and metals products.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>

Executive Vice President

Another Division

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?
	Samuel Schott
	03/28/2001 01:09 PM
		 
FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Best Rgds.

Samuel x3-9890 (GCP)
Enron Net Works _ Global Data Management

Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?

	
	

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

   

	
	                           
	

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie    

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves, 
we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather 
under the EOL GTC's.

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name?

	
	

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Mark

See my initial email to Sam Schott and Stephanie, about 3rd email from the 
bottom, there's two samples of how we could set divisions (the same could be 
said for dba's).
